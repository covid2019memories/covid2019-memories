Wuhan to Hong Kong flight passengers to complete health declaration form from January 21
 
In response to the outbreak of 2019-ncov pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province, the Food and Health Bureau held a press conference on January 20 to update the public on the latest situation. There are currently no confirmed cases in Hong Kong, and surveillance measures are being stepped up, passengers arriving from Wuhan are required to complete a health declaration form from January 21. During a recent visit to Hong Kong, a Hsinking newspaper reporter found that many universities in the city had reminded teachers and students to take personal hygiene precautions.
 
Speaking at a press conference, Hong Kong Secretary for Food and Health Chan said that as at 0800 hours on January 20, there were no confirmed cases in Hong Kong and there were 106 suspected cases (i.e. suspected cases) with patients aged between 1 and 67. Among all reported cases, 20 were hospitalised, with 18 in stable condition and two in critical condition and one in serious condition.
 
In response to 2019-ncov pneumonia, the Hong Kong authorities have stepped up their surveillance measures. Originally, only those who had been to Wuhan and had symptoms needed to be reported, but now, criteria extended to those with travel history to Hubei Province. From January 21, all passengers from Wuhan to Hong Kong are required to fill out a health declaration form, leaving contact information for easy tracking.

The director of health, Chen Hanyi, said that the health declaration form was only applicable to air passengers for the time being, in view of the Operability problem. Because if mainland travellers at all ports had to fill in the declaration forms, "a large number of people at a time [ staying ] in a place where the air is not so circulating might not be ideal for the control of infectious diseases, " he said, at present, hand-held instruments have been added to detect body temperature at high-speed railway ports.

Previously, the Hong Kong SAR government has activated the "serious" response level for 2019-ncov pneumonia, which is the second of the three levels (alert, serious and emergency) . In addition, "severe emerging infectious respiratory system" was gazetted on 8 January as a statutorily notifiable infectious disease under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance and came into effect on the same day. Therefore, if an infected or suspected infected patient refuses to cooperate, such as refusing to be quarantined or quarantined, the Hong Kong health authorities have the power to take coercive measures against him or her.

On January 13, under the arrangement of the NHC, the deputy director of the Food and Health Bureau, Xu Deyi, and representatives from the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority, visited Wuhan to understand the situation, prevention and control measures and clinical treatment of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.
