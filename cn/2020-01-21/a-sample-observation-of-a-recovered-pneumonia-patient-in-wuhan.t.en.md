The hospitals there are very responsible, and the medical staff are very good. I would like to thank them.

Because of the limited manpower, they are also operating under a high load every day, working 16 hours a day, morning to night.

##I thought it was a cold. I had to be transferred twice

Deep One degree: When did you feel something wrong with your body?

Wang Kang: I felt something wrong on December 24. At that time, the symptoms were dizziness, headache, weakness in the limbs and aching in the limbs. At that time, I thought it was a cold, because it was similar to a cold. When I went to work the next day, I felt limp all over, i can't use my strength. I took a leave of absence and took a taxi home to a nearby hospital for treatment. On the 25th in the hospital, the same day had an intravenous drip, did not delay their own, went to the hospital has been infusion, there was no fever, after three days, about 27 consecutive high fever.

Deep degree: those days you have been in the hospital?

Wang Kang: No, go to the hospital every day infusion, infusion will come back, according to the common cold in the treatment. Then 27 fever, has been high fever, at that time has been infusion, but the symptoms did not improve, but more and more serious. I can barely move. I'm severely incapacitated. Come down to walk two steps on oxygen especially low, breathing difficulties, is to lie down. Later on to check the blood, at that time check a blood routine, there is no problem, is normal, the next day and check blood, check liver function and so on. I was on the high side of the Cholaminase in college, and specifically told the doctor, because I do not know the pneumonia this thing, then did not pay attention to this thing, I am afraid of what other diseases. I had to wait another day to get the results, and the next day was the weekend, so I went home. Because the I.V. didn't work, so I stopped, and I stayed home for two days.

Deep degree: How about those two days?

Wang Kang: (gets sick) the serious influence appetite, I can not eat the thing, ate to want to vomit, basically drank some porridge, drank some water.

Deep degree: How about getting the results on Monday?

Wang Kang: When I got the results on Monday, I found that the liver function was a little abnormal, so I thought it was a problem of liver function. And said, "let's go to the Wuhan Union Hospital. " . I rested at home for a few days and went to concord on the morning of the 1st. Go to the hospital still have a fever, bought medicine, drink after sweating, but continue to have a fever, the general fever to 39 degrees Celsius, the highest fever to 40,41 degrees Celsius, take fever medicine to reduce some, but has been repeated fever, fever and fever.

Deep Degree: In the Concorde Hospital to do what tests?

Wang Kang: After I was admitted to Union Medical College Hospital, I went to the Department of endocrinology for a general check-up. January 2nd, because my sats are down to 60% , and I'm GONNA die. I took a chest x-ray. The x-ray was taken a few buildings away from my hospital. The doctor had to push my bed to take the x-ray. All the way, the doctor told my mother to keep talking to me and not let me fall asleep, because his sats are low and he wants to sleep. I couldn't use the oxygen machine in the hospital, I could only use the oxygen bottle, and after the film was taken, it was as if a special person asked me, where do I work, where do I pass on my way to work, where do I live, and so on, to get this information.

Deep one: How do you provide this information?

Wang Kang: I told him that I work as a salesman near the Hankou Railway Station, near my home (which is only a few hundred meters from the south China Seafood Market) , and ride my bike home every day. I didn't go to the seafood market, I went to the south China fruit market on the 22nd or so, it rained a little that day, I didn't bring my raincoat and umbrella, I may have caught a bit of rain, caught a cold, I thought it was a cold, because the early symptoms of pneumonia are basically the same as a cold.

Deep degree: The result of the examination of the Hospital of Concord?

Wang Kang: at 11:00 a.m. on January 2, I told my mother that I might be transferred to Jinyintan Hospital. Then my mother began to organize her things. At 12:00, she said she might not need it. They were talking about my condition, and they had, like, a video conference, and they talked for, like, two hours. At that time, my mother was afraid the hospital would not accept me, because she did not know pneumonia this disease, she thought it was a major disease, especially afraid. The doctor told her again that she couldn't put me in a coma, and that she would be even more frightened and worried if she kept talking to me. At that time, we didn't even know what the hospital was.

Deep degree: later how to go to the gold and Silver Pool Hospital?

Wang Kang: When officially transferred that afternoon, there was a certificate that said it was highly suspected of pneumonia. Around 7:00 pm, I was picked up by an ambulance from the hospital. When I got to the hospital, I started to take oxygen, blood oxygen, ekg and so on. I was taken to the ICU at about 8:40 pm. I went in to have a blood draw. My sister was about to rush in when two doctors and two security guards stopped her. Because the ICU is completely isolated. Then I was transferred to the ICU, and my sister followed me. I owe my life to my sister's care.

Deep degree: What did the elder sister do?

Wang Kang: Because the isolation patient is very many, the nurse is too busy, we this kind of patient high fever does not subside, does not have the appetite, the blood oxygen is low, my elder sister is one mouthful rice, one mouthful water ground feed, also must carry the excrement for me to carry urine. The hospital gave her a mask. She stayed with me for a dozen days, built seven stools next to my bed, padded the covers, and slept like that.

Fever is to the Golden Pool Hospital the second day has been reduced. From the 1st to the 3rd, my sister kept feeding me water, and she kept taking medicine. She had a fever and sweating repeatedly, and the fever dropped very fast. I was lying on my back, and my sister fed me with a straw, and she had to hold my head up.

Around the 10th, when I was transferred, I was able to move, I was able to take care of myself, so I let my sister out. My nephew is sick. She stayed here for more than ten days without changing her clothes, because she couldn't get out. I disinfected her on the way out, and then I checked her out before I let her out. My parents also accompany me, but after all, they are old, to the gold and Silver Lake when they are not allowed to enter, my sister will not let them in, we cooperate with the doctor.

Deep One degree: What did the doctor tell you to do?

Wang Kang: the doctor told my father to go out to buy some human albumin, because I have not eaten for several days, no nutrition. We live in Hankou. My Dad went to Wuchang and bought five bottles. But at that time, it was said that quarantined patients did not have refrigeration equipment. Human Albumin should be kept in the refrigerator. Take five bottles and the hospital will only take one bottle. Let the remaining four bottles go back to the refrigerator. My home is very far from the hospital. My mother got a room in a hotel outside the hospital, to freeze a few vials of albumin, and then send me one every day. A 500-odd bottle, maybe 50 or 75 milliliters, but it's a pretty small bottle, yellow. In five days, I'll be able to eat, I'll be able to feed myself, and I won't need it.

# from a dozen bottles of fluids to walking around in bed

Deep degree: How do doctors treat it? Did they tell you what the plan is?

Wang Kang: This disease has no specific medicine, no quick solution, can only activate your body's own immune function to fight the virus, it will cause damage to other organs. The medical staff, doctors and nurses over there are very good. He will tell you what this is for when he takes any medicine. Fluids, anti-inflammatories, fevers, that sort of thing, mainly to activate the lungs. They also said to hit the stomach, liver protection drugs to protect various organs, especially the stomach. The others are for pneumonia. I don't know exactly what they are.

Deep degree: so you are basically in the hospital after the way the infusion?

Wang Kang: Yes, transfusion. Lose a lot, the previous few days are a dozen bottles every day, to 8,9 is (every day) about 8 bottles. Sometimes you get a prescription, but the doctor tells you to stop, you take it. You have to cooperate fully. They change their dressings. I don't know exactly what it is, which means activating the lungs.

Deep One degree: Why to reduce drug later?

Wang Kang: Because slowly my blood oxygen can reach 90, they began to give me to reduce the oxygen concentration and flow rate, my heart rate is normal, blood pressure after everything is normal, take off my oxygen, take off my ECG. I think it's mostly because I'm young, I'm 23 years old, and all my organs are helping me.

Deep degree: This illness is very serious to your intestines and stomach injury?

Wang Kang: Well, the first day I arrived in Concord, my father bought me a breakfast in Wuhan called Shumai with a little pepper in it. I was not afraid of spicy at all, eating hot pot is nothing. But then ate a small mouthful of Shao Mai, there is a bit of pepper, my Esophagus, stomach all morning very uncomfortable. Still have I go to the toilet on the bed, urinate OK, can suffocate, defecate words, I feel particularly disgraceful on the bed, hold in 5 days. Not Since Day one. We didn't start until the 5th or 6th, and then we pulled out those ekg's, and then we went in, and there was a toilet that you could sit on. That's when the bleeding started. I thought it was some kind of hemorrhoid, but it wasn't. It was an intestinal injury, plus I hadn't had a bowel movement in five days, and my anus burst.

It was so bad, I couldn't hold it any longer, but I didn't want to be in bed, so I took the oxygen out, and then I asked the nurse to take the ekg off, and then I walked slowly, and then I coughed violently. Because I couldn't actually get out of bed, I couldn't breathe at all with a single violent cough, and it only took me five minutes to walk a short distance to the bathroom, where I kept coughing and coughing, but not forcefully.

Deep One degree: Why to transfer Ward?

Wang Kang: Before the 10th, there were only two kinds of intensive care and ICU. The ICU is completely isolated. It's life-threatening. Because more and more people, the ward is not enough, to the serious illness and mild separation, at that time I was almost well, but I was still seriously ill, Wuhan at that time only Jinyintan Disease Control Center to receive unidentified pneumonia patients. I was transferred to another ICU on the 10th. I could walk around the house by myself, pour my own water, bathe myself, and do almost anything.

Deep degree: Who are the people in the ICU with you?

Wang Kang: When I was transferred to the ICU, I was joined by four people. The other three people were a 62-year-old father, a 68-year-old mother-in-law and a 42-year-old man. I stayed here for five days before I was discharged from the hospital. During those few days, the three of them basically didn't eat and had no one to take care of them. When the nurse Fed them, they couldn't eat either, because the food in the hospital was very nutritious, but when they first went there, the first day the food is not very good, the next day is particularly good, beef and mutton, chicken, duck and fish are very balanced, yogurt, fruit are also have. But they still can't eat it.

## When I got out of the hospital, I was feeling better

Deep One degree: When do you think you are basically getting better?

Wang Kang: I feel better when I can move. Gradually I feel better and better. I stopped coughing a lot in the hospital.

Deep degree: How did your doctor tell you to leave the hospital?

Wang Kang: On the 13th, I had an examination and a chest CT. I also had blood drawn. The doctor informed me on the 14th. After the injection, he informed me that my chest was in a very good condition. I asked my family to come on the 15th. The doctor told me not to go to a crowded place, to rest, on time to take medicine.

Deep One degree: How does it feel to be out of the hospital?

Wang Kang: I was out of the hospital at noon, when I really want to eat hot dry noodles, too long to eat, and then went to eat hot dry noodles, eat half a bowl. I could walk on my own, but I couldn't walk fast. When I first got out of the hospital, I would walk a few steps, my leg muscles would cramp up, my legs were weak, my mother was so old, she could walk faster than me. I didn't feel good about myself, including after I got out of the hospital, because I'd been in bed for more than 20 days, too long, and didn't get much exercise.

The next day I forced myself to go out for a walk, in the vicinity of the home, my parents are particularly worried, I was not allowed to go out, has been urging me to go home. Then I came back in the afternoon much better than the first day, better physical strength, walking slowly can be faster. I'm not that tired.

Deep One degree: What's the status quo?

Wang Kang: My body is getting stronger and stronger. It's good. I can't digest it outside of Taihang Mountains. You can't run, but you can walk for a long time. But it's easy to get sentimental, it's easy to cry. Because the family was really worried, my mother was in her 60s, and she was crying at home every day. I have four uncles, two aunts and an aunt who care about me, and neighbors who care about me. When I was done, everyone came to deliver, the Milkman, the Moneyman, to see me. When I was ill, my friend went to see me, but the doctor wouldn't let him in. He took one look at the glass door and ran upstairs to cry.

Deep degree: Your sister to take care of you, physical problems?

Wang Kang: She came out with a cold, I told her to go to the hospital for a check-up, she went, is a cold.

Deep degree: When the doctor told you that you are pneumonia, do you realize that this disease is more serious?

Wang Kang: I do not play the mobile phone very much, at that time the friend said me, I may be this disease, I said should not be so unlucky. To be honest, I didn't realize the severity of the disease until I was well enough to watch the news at home, and I felt Treme. When I was in hospital, I always thought it was OK, just a disease, because I had never been in hospital since I was a child.

Deep One degree: How much did the whole treatment cost?

Wang Kang: A total of more than 20,000 yuan was spent, and more than 10,000 yuan was spent in concord. When we arrived at the Golden Pool, we basically confiscated some money. We collected a deposit of 3000 yuan and 300 yuan for meals.
