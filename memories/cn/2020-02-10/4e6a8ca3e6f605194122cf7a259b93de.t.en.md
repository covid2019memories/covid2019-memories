Function introduction, record people and disease, aging, death of the way.

On the afternoon of February 9, four days after being "returned" by the Shelter Hospital, the Liu Jun family was notified by the Neighborhood Committee that a vehicle would be arranged to take their parents to hospital for treatment that day.

Before that, after days of online help seeking, Liu Jun had felt hopeless about being hospitalized, especially after his father's fever had subsided and he had come to terms with the fact that he could not be hospitalized. For the sudden admission notice, he is difficult to say, in the end, is his network help, or the recent "exhaustive treatment" screening policy effect.

In fact, it was nearly two weeks before the city was shut down, when Wuhan realized that four groups of people, including confirmed cases of home quarantine and suspected patients, should be "collected, treated and treated" .

During this period, more and more families in Wuhan has a cluster of disease, some patients with mild illness could not be properly treated to become serious illness.

To this end, the opening of the Shelter Hospital has been a key initiative, with occasional cure noting that after the shelter has admitted thousands of patients with confirmed mild cases, those over the age of 65 or in critical condition with underlying illnesses, even the elderly, who were once turned away from the Shelter Hospital, are a more difficult group.

To ensure that no one is left behind, Wuhan is doing its best to canvass "four groups of people, " according to official reports. As of the evening of February 8,9.79 million people in 3.91 million households had been surveyed, 92 per cent of which had been completed. By 2400 hours on February 9th, I want them all cleared.

As of February 10, the occasional cure had been observed in three consecutive families, and in addition to Liu Jun's parents being admitted to the hospital, two of the three confirmed patients in a family of five had been admitted, two close contacts are in home quarantine.

The most serious situation is Xu Ayi and his wife, 57-year-old Xu Ayi, who has been diagnosed as highly suspicious by CT images, but has not been able to carry out a nucleic acid test. Her condition became increasingly serious after she was rejected by the Shelter Hospital on the 6th for undiagnosed reasons.

On the night of February 9, after a few days of waiting in a community registration queue, aunt Xu and her husband were sent by the community to a hotel to be quarantined. They are still waiting for the results of nucleic acid tests and when they can be admitted to hospital.

The Ark of Noah, which some find difficult to reach

The opening of the shelter hospital has become a key step that is really beginning to change the previously recommended home quarantine for people with mild illness in Wuhan.

On Feb. 5, Bai Yansong, a respiratory and critical care specialist and president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said that a large number of patients had not been admitted to hospitals in time, in particular, the mobility of patients with mild illness in society, and living with their families, will lead to further social and family infections, becoming the most important factor exacerbating the epidemic.

In the evening of the same day, the first three shelter hospitals were admitted to the first group, just two days after the construction was finalized on February 3.

The "Shelter Hospital" is composed of medical function unit, Ward Unit and Technical Support Unit. It is a kind of modular medical equipment and has many functions such as emergency treatment, surgical treatment and clinical examination.

After the launch, many families with new crown pneumonia in Wuhan have taken the Shelter Hospital as a hope for their families to enter the normal admission environment, while the outside world is still debating whether the shelter hospital will cause cross infection, civil disorder and other problems.

"At home [ in isolation ] there is always anxiety, both about passing the infection on to the family and about not being admitted to a hospital if the condition worsens. After the 46-year-old moved into a shelter in Wuchang on Saturday, there was some relief for the family.

In contrast, for Liu Jun, whose father was old and frail, the shelter hospital once lit a fire of hope for the family and doused it the same night.

Liu Jun's father's report card for a new coronavirus nucleic acid test

Liu Jun's parents tested positive for nucleic acid after coughing and running a fever for several days on Feb. 3, but he still had a hard time finding a bed, and his father's breathing became increasingly difficult, so he began seeking help online.

On Feb. 5, Liu Jun was contacted by community residents who had been unable to help and told to pack up as soon as possible, and a car would take his father to the Shelter Hospital for treatment that day.

Liu Jun once had doubts about this, his father because of illness from childhood lower limb disability, life can not take care of themselves. In his own access to information about the treatment of the Shelter Hospital, are pointing to Self-care, mild illness of young patients.

Too late to question, the father's high fever, the shelter hospital has become the most likely access to regular treatment of a door, at least at home than self-isolation to take medicine, they even look forward to, it may be possible to secure a bed at the shelter hospital through the referral channel.

With that in mind, Liu Jun edited the original appeal, updating it with the good news that his father would be taken to the shelter hospital.

At around 9 p.m. , Liu Jun drove his wheelchair bound mother and father to the rendezvous point, following community instructions, and did not drive away until he had put his parents on a bus.

Later, according to the parents'description, the bus also took a long time to pick up many patients from many places along the way. In order to prevent cross-infection, the bus was not allowed to turn on the heating, while the windows were opened to let in air, which made it feel colder.

Had it not been for the subsequent rejection, Liu would have accepted all this with equanimity, thinking it was all worth it. However, to the Shelter Hospital, staff but in the query after informed, because his father can not take care of his own life, his mother has a history of hypertension, are not in the shelter hospital admission.

Like Liu Jun's parents, Xu Ayi, 57, was diagnosed with a highly suspicious cough on a CT scan days later, but a nucleic acid test requires a certificate from a community hospital.

6, the Community Hospital informed no longer issued a certificate, will be directly unified to send patients to the shelter hospital. But arriving at Wuchang's converted Shelter Hospital, Hongshan Stadium, they were turned away because they had not yet tested positive for nucleic acid.

After several days of continuous rain in Wuhan, Aunt Xu and her husband returned home after several hours of cold wind blowing in Hongshan Gymnasium. Once again, in an attempt to get an early diagnosis, Gasp went to the community hospital alone to make a list, only to be told that the list was no longer available and that all suspected cases would now be tested at a centralized isolation point.

By the end of the night of February 9, after waiting in line for three days, Xu and her husband were sent to the central isolation hotel to await the results of nucleic acid tests. At this time, aunt Xu has been suffocating breathing difficulty, answering the phone in the talk has been very laborious.

Chen Ziran (not her real name) , 48, runs a family of five, but the virus has hit the family so hard that her husband and in-laws have been diagnosed but have been unable to find a bed.

In the past few days, do not have the conditions of isolation within the family, has been diagnosed 3 cases of visual aggravation of the disease, has not yet appeared symptoms of the physical and mental fatigue.

As of the evening of the 8th, only the seriously ill husband was sent to the designated hospital for assistance, while the two elderly people were trapped in the designated hospital no bed, the shelter hospital no admission, isolation hotel in the queue embarrassing situation.

The ever-changing policies and the confused grassroots

_

Liu Jun actually understood that his parents had been turned away from the Shelter Hospital. "What I didn't understand was the ability of the community hospital to send my parents to the shelter without knowing it, even after we were sent back, they wanted us to try another shelter hospital. "

That night, after hours on the return bus, Liu Jun's father was rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital and returned home after a brief emergency. It was after 3:00 in the morning when I got home. "Liu Jun told the occasional cure.

The experience left Liu Jun deeply disappointed with the Shelter Hospital and the neighborhood committee, and his father's condition did not improve. The next day, in a fit of rage, he updated his plea for help, expressing his displeasure with the shelter hospital and the community.

Behind this is a lack of thought-out organizational skills in the rush to raise money. Wan Jun, the captain of the Wuchang Module and vice president of the Wuhan People's Hospital, told the hospital that he had been cured occasionally. He received a notice on the afternoon of February 3 that he would dock with the module hospital. On the morning of February 4, he visited the venue for the first time, and the first group of patients arrived on February 5.

On February 6, the morning after the first patients checked in, there was negative news about the lack of electricity, poor facilities and even extreme behavior like smashing things because of dissatisfaction.

Xiao Jinsong, president of the Hubei Association of Psychological Counselors and professor of neurology at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, told the hospital on the 7th that the most serious problem in the Shelter Hospital is not the treatment dilemma, but the problem of psychological counseling.

"As a temporary holding area, the conditions in the shelter hospital must be relatively ordinary. Therefore, patients may feel conflicted when they first check in. In addition, they may feel sick and worried that their condition will worsen, and they may feel lonely when they leave their families and come to an unfamiliar environment, actually needs some counseling. "

However, the introduction of too hastily, so that the shelter hospital in just a few days of preparation, the lack of psychological counseling for patients on the preparation plan, but also many medical staff feel aggrieved.

Fortunately, more patients begin to accept the status quo after a period of stay. Facing the problems of lower room temperature and poor toilet environment in the shelter hospital, on February 7, Mr. Xia's family told the occasional cure, these may only be put on a non-priority to consider, but more important is that the shelter hospital can have medical personnel to care.

On the 8th, Xiao Jinsong told the occasional cure that he had sent the music therapy plan to the front-line medical staff, hoping to help the two sides better communicate and have a positive impact.

Wan Jun, the captain of the Wuchang Shelter and vice president of the Wuhan People's Hospital, also told of the occasional cure. After realizing the problem of psychological counseling, the hospital and the second Xiangya Hospital worked together overnight to compile a psychological manual and photocopy 1,000 copies, will be distributed to patients. Sun Hui also said that they plan to conduct psychological counseling through the stadium sound three times in the morning, middle and evening, and will establish patient communities for mutual self-governance.

Also lost in the emergency was a grass-roots community worker, a community hospital worker who used the phrase "policy changes day in and day out" to explain the mistakes and inefficiencies they had to make at work.

The staff told the occasional cure that when the shelter hospital first opened, it informed all patients under the age of 65 with mild illness that they could receive it, and that nucleic acid tests could be performed at the shelter hospital.

But Aunt Xu explained with her own experience that it is a misreading to send suspected patients directly to the shelter hospital and test nucleic acid on the spot.

"It was later informed that there would be no nucleic acid testing in the shelter, only confirmed cases. And now do not allow patients to go to the hospital for nucleic acid testing, because easy to cause cross-infection, to the unified hotel isolation, and then arranged by the central isolation point for nucleic acid testing. "

On the evening of the 8th, the staff member gave advice to a suspected patient similar to aunt Xu on the phone. "You should also think carefully about whether to go to a hotel to be quarantined. After all, the conditions there are not very good, if you feel OK, " he said, the symptoms aren't that bad. It's best to stay at home. "

Before the story broke, another Neighborhood Committee told the occasional cure that its community had been told that from the 10th, all suspected patients would be quarantined and tested for nucleic acids at the point of separation.

But for close contacts, the Neighborhood Committee director said the current requirement is to try to isolate all four groups of people, but recommended that close contacts do CT screening first.

The occasional cure was found to be the implementation of all four categories of quarantine notices for confirmed, suspected, Febrile and close contacts issued since 2 February in Hubei, although the specific situation varies from neighborhood to neighborhood.

Under the high pressure of the epidemic situation, the community streets were required to take charge of the first medical end of grading diagnosis and treatment, and after carrying out house-to-house screening, the patients were sent to designated hospitals, shelter hospitals or reported to the authorities without beds, the suspected crowd should be quarantined by the hotel, checked by nucleic acid, taken temperature and recorded by the people with fever and close contact.

In contrast to such a huge workload, the community was understaffed, which led to a large number of suspected and confirmed patients having to go to the hospital for injections and medicines on their own in the early stages of the epidemic, the means of prevention and control to cut off the source of infection have been in a state of failure.

Critical patient at Landslide dam hospital

On February 5, Hu Lishan, director of the People's Congress Department of Wuhan and Deputy Secretary of the CPC Municipal Committee, said at a press conference that the most difficult problem encountered in the process of centralized isolation treatment for the "four categories of personnel" was that the pressure of centralized treatment was very great.

He admitted that the city's "Landslide dam" of confirmed and suspected patients not being treated at designated hospitals was heart-wrenching and painful, and revealed that a total of 20,629 people were in home quarantine.

On the evening of the 8th, Sun Hui, captain of Kong Hon's shelter and Deputy Secretary of the Wuhan Union Hospital, told the occasional cure that the 1,500 beds were nearly full, less than three days from the commissioning date.

On the night of Feb. 9, after her parents were admitted to the hospital, Liu Jun was finally able to take a breath and think about what had happened over the past few days.

"The general feeling, starting on the 6th, is that the capacity of the community to accommodate patients has suddenly improved, " he said.

It is worth noting that on the morning of February 6, the mobilization meeting for the comprehensive investigation of the new crown pneumonia was also held at the same time. To do our best to prevent and control the epidemic at its source, Wuhan has to exert all its efforts to go into homes and screen "four categories" of personnel. According to multiple sources, the task of checking the nucleic acid of suspected personnel as soon as possible and ensuring treatment for confirmed personnel has been hanging over the heads of every level of prevention and Control Damocles in Wuhan in recent days

As of the evening of February 8,9.79 million people in 3.91 million households had been surveyed, with a completion rate of 92 percent, according to the China Youth Net article. By 2400 hours on February 9th, I want them all cleared.

According to the People's Daily "Xiake Island" , on February 9, a total of 16,739 party members, cadres, workers and university teachers from enterprises and institutions of the city-wide municipal government were integrated into the sub-district community work team, round-the-clock coverage of the "four categories of personnel" , to ensure that all should be collected, do not miss a person.

In addition to conducting house-to-house investigations in the community, People's Daily and others have also opened channels for collecting information on quarantining critically ill patients at home. According to the source to the occasional cure revealed that this part of the personnel information will be directly reported to the Central Steering Group to Hubei, Hubei according to the different situation by the personnel for classified treatment, isolation.

The opening of the shelter hospital was a key step in the release of Landslide dam. But also in the future, does not meet the criteria for admission to the Shelter Hospital of the critically ill and elderly patients with a prominent conflict.

On Feb. 9, Liu Jun's parents were taken to Tongji Sino French new town hospital. According to Wuhan Health Commission announced the use of 28 designated Wuhan Hospital beds, the hospital has more than the opening of beds.

Regarding the discrepancy of similar beds, the HHC notes that this is the hospital making every effort to arrange additional beds for more suspected patients in accordance with the "due diligence" requirement.

At present, 28 designated hospitals and Vulcan Mountain, Raytheon Mountain Hospital has become the main admission and treatment of critically ill patients.

According to an earlier interview with Academician Zhong Nanshan, the establishment of the Vulcan Mountain Hospital will mainly accept mild and suspected patients, thus making room for more serious patients in the original designated hospitals. As things stand, the positioning of Vulcan Mountain and Thor Mountain has changed. However, the construction of the intensive care unit, which requires more sophisticated medical equipment, has been much slower than in a shelter hospital.

As of 2400 hours on February 9, there were 16,902 confirmed cases in Wuhan, an increase of 1,620 from yesterday, according to data released by Wuhan Health Commission.

There are 3 open hospitals ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————. At the same time, a second batch of shelter hospitals is under construction, which is expected to have 6,700 beds, totaling about 11,100 beds.

At the same time, the city's 28 designated hospitals and the two mountain hospital total beds in 10,300, plus the first batch of 3 shelter hospital 4,400 beds, there is still a gap.

But as of 24:00 on February 9, designated hospitals and Vulcan Mountain, Raytheon Mountain Hospital left only 378 beds for critically ill patients, admission capacity is stretched.

As suspected cases are gradually diagnosed, the crucial contradiction that remains to be resolved in Landslide dam is the question of how to treat the elderly, like Xu, and how to treat the suspected seriously ill.

The opening of the shelter hospital has become a key step that is really beginning to change the previously recommended home quarantine for people with mild illness in Wuhan.

On Feb. 5, Bai Yansong, a respiratory and critical care specialist and president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said that a large number of patients had not been admitted to hospitals in time, in particular, the mobility of patients with mild illness in society, and living with their families, will lead to further social and family infections, becoming the most important factor exacerbating the epidemic.

In the evening of the same day, the first three shelter hospitals were admitted to the first group, just two days after the construction was finalized on February 3.

The "Shelter Hospital" is composed of medical function unit, Ward Unit and Technical Support Unit. It is a kind of modular medical equipment and has many functions such as emergency treatment, surgical treatment and clinical examination.

After the launch, many families with new crown pneumonia in Wuhan have taken the Shelter Hospital as a hope for their families to enter the normal admission environment, while the outside world is still debating whether the shelter hospital will cause cross infection, civil disorder and other problems.

"At home [ in isolation ] there is always anxiety, both about passing the infection on to the family and about not being admitted to a hospital if the condition worsens. After the 46-year-old moved into a shelter in Wuchang on Saturday, there was some relief for the family.

In contrast, for Liu Jun, whose father was old and frail, the shelter hospital once lit a fire of hope for the family and doused it the same night.

Liu Jun's father's report card for a new coronavirus nucleic acid test

Liu Jun's parents tested positive for nucleic acid after coughing and running a fever for several days on Feb. 3, but he still had a hard time finding a bed, and his father's breathing became increasingly difficult, so he began seeking help online.

On Feb. 5, Liu Jun was contacted by community residents who had been unable to help and told to pack up as soon as possible, and a car would take his father to the Shelter Hospital for treatment that day.

Liu Jun once had doubts about this, his father because of illness from childhood lower limb disability, life can not take care of themselves. In his own access to information about the treatment of the Shelter Hospital, are pointing to Self-care, mild illness of young patients.

Later, according to the parents'description, the bus also took a long time to pick up many patients from many places along the way. In order to prevent cross-infection, the bus was not allowed to turn on the heating, while the windows were opened to let in air, which made it feel colder.

Had it not been for the subsequent rejection, Liu would have accepted all this with equanimity, thinking it was all worth it.

After several days of continuous rain in Wuhan, Aunt Xu and her husband returned home after several hours of cold wind blowing in Hongshan Gymnasium.

By the end of the night of February 9, after waiting in line for three days, Xu and her husband were sent to the central isolation hotel to await the results of nucleic acid tests.

He received a notice on the afternoon of February 3 that he would dock with the module hospital. On the morning of February 4, he visited the venue for the first time, and the first group of patients arrived on February 5.

On February 6, the morning after the first patients checked in, there was negative news about the lack of electricity, poor facilities and even extreme behavior like smashing things because of dissatisfaction.

Xiao Jinsong, president of the Hubei Association of Psychological Counselors and professor of neurology at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, told the hospital on the 7th that the most serious problem in the Shelter Hospital is not the treatment dilemma, but the problem of psychological counseling.

"As a temporary holding area, the conditions in the shelter hospital must be relatively ordinary. Therefore, patients may feel conflicted when they first check in. In addition, they may feel sick and worried that their condition will worsen, and they may feel lonely when they leave their families and come to an unfamiliar environment, actually needs some counseling. "

However, the introduction of too hastily, so that the shelter hospital in just a few days of preparation, the lack of psychological counseling for patients on the preparation plan, but also many medical staff feel aggrieved.

Fortunately, more patients begin to accept the status quo after a period of stay. Facing the problems of lower room temperature and poor toilet environment in the shelter hospital, on February 7, Mr. Xia's family told the occasional cure, these may only be put on a non-priority to consider, but more important is that the shelter hospital can have medical personnel to care.

Liu Jun actually understood that his parents had been turned away from the Shelter Hospital. "What I didn't understand was the ability of the community hospital to send my parents to the shelter without knowing it, even after we were sent back, they wanted us to try another shelter hospital. "

That night, after hours on the return bus, Liu Jun's father was rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital and returned home after a brief emergency. It was after 3:00 in the morning when I got home. "Liu Jun told the occasional cure.

The experience left Liu Jun deeply disappointed with the Shelter Hospital and the neighborhood committee, and his father's condition did not improve. The next day, in a fit of rage, he updated his plea for help, expressing his displeasure with the shelter hospital and the community.

On the 8th, Xiao Jinsong told the occasional cure that he had sent the music therapy plan to the front-line medical staff, hoping to help the two sides better communicate and have a positive impact.

Wan Jun, the captain of the Wuchang Shelter and vice president of the Wuhan People's Hospital, also told of the occasional cure. After realizing the problem of psychological counseling, the hospital and the second Xiangya Hospital worked together overnight to compile a psychological manual and photocopy 1,000 copies, will be distributed to patients. Sun Hui also said that they plan to conduct psychological counseling through the stadium sound three times in the morning, middle and evening, and will establish patient communities for mutual self-governance.

Also lost in the emergency was a grass-roots community worker, a community hospital worker who used the phrase "policy changes day in and day out" to explain the mistakes and inefficiencies they had to make at work.

The staff told the occasional cure that when the shelter hospital first opened, it informed all patients under the age of 65 with mild illness that they could receive it, and that nucleic acid tests could be performed at the shelter hospital.

But Aunt Xu explained with her own experience that it is a misreading to send suspected patients directly to the shelter hospital and test nucleic acid on the spot.

"It was later informed that there would be no nucleic acid testing in the shelter, only confirmed cases. And now do not allow patients to go to the hospital for nucleic acid testing, because easy to cause cross-infection, to the unified hotel isolation, and then arranged by the central isolation point for nucleic acid testing. "

On the evening of the 8th, the staff member gave advice to a suspected patient similar to aunt Xu on the phone. "You should also think carefully about whether to go to a hotel to be quarantined. After all, the conditions there are not very good, if you feel OK, " he said, the symptoms aren't that bad. It's best to stay at home. "

Before the story broke, another Neighborhood Committee told the occasional cure that its community had been told that from the 10th, all suspected patients would be quarantined and tested for nucleic acids at the point of separation.

But for close contacts, the Neighborhood Committee director said the current requirement is to try to isolate all four groups of people, but recommended that close contacts do CT screening first.

The occasional cure was found to be the implementation of all four categories of quarantine notices for confirmed, suspected, Febrile and close contacts issued since 2 February in Hubei, although the specific situation varies from neighborhood to neighborhood.

Under the high pressure of the epidemic situation, the community streets were required to take charge of the first medical end of grading diagnosis and treatment, and after carrying out house-to-house screening, the patients were sent to designated hospitals, shelter hospitals or reported to the authorities without beds, the suspected crowd should be quarantined by the hotel, checked by nucleic acid, taken temperature and recorded by the people with fever and close contact.

In contrast to such a huge workload, the community was understaffed, which led to a large number of suspected and confirmed patients having to go to the hospital for injections and medicines on their own in the early stages of the epidemic, the means of prevention and control to cut off the source of infection have been in a state of failure.

Critical patient at Landslide dam hospital

On February 5, Hu Lishan, director of the People's Congress Department of Wuhan and Deputy Secretary of the CPC Municipal Committee, said at a press conference that the most difficult problem encountered in the process of centralized isolation treatment for the "four categories of personnel" was that the pressure of centralized treatment was very great.

He admitted that the city's "Landslide dam" of confirmed and suspected patients not being treated at designated hospitals was heart-wrenching and painful, and revealed that a total of 20,629 people were in home quarantine.

On the evening of the 8th, Sun Hui, captain of Kong Hon's shelter and Deputy Secretary of the Wuhan Union Hospital, told the occasional cure that the 1,500 beds were nearly full, less than three days from the commissioning date.

On the night of Feb. 9, after her parents were admitted to the hospital, Liu Jun was finally able to take a breath and think about what had happened over the past few days.

"The general feeling, starting on the 6th, is that the capacity of the community to accommodate patients has suddenly improved, " he said.

It is worth noting that on the morning of February 6, the mobilization meeting for the comprehensive investigation of the new crown pneumonia was also held at the same time. To do our best to prevent and control the epidemic at its source, Wuhan has to exert all its efforts to go into homes and screen "four categories" of personnel. According to multiple sources, the task of checking the nucleic acid of suspected personnel as soon as possible and ensuring treatment for confirmed personnel has been hanging over the heads of every level of prevention and Control Damocles in Wuhan in recent days

As of the evening of February 8,9.79 million people in 3.91 million households had been surveyed, with a completion rate of 92 percent, according to the China Youth Net article. By 2400 hours on February 9th, I want them all cleared.

According to the People's Daily "Xiake Island" , on February 9, a total of 16,739 party members, cadres, workers and university teachers from enterprises and institutions of the city-wide municipal government were integrated into the sub-district community work team, round-the-clock coverage of the "four categories of personnel" , to ensure that all should be collected, do not miss a person.

In addition to conducting house-to-house investigations in the community, People's Daily and others have also opened channels for collecting information on quarantining critically ill patients at home. According to the source to the occasional cure revealed that this part of the personnel information will be directly reported to the Central Steering Group to Hubei, Hubei according to the different situation by the personnel for classified treatment, isolation.

The opening of the shelter hospital was a key step in the release of Landslide dam. But also in the future, does not meet the criteria for admission to the Shelter Hospital of the critically ill and elderly patients with a prominent conflict.

On Feb. 9, Liu Jun's parents were taken to Tongji Sino French new town hospital. According to Wuhan Health Commission announced the use of 28 designated Wuhan Hospital beds, the hospital has more than the opening of beds.

Regarding the discrepancy of similar beds, the HHC notes that this is the hospital making every effort to arrange additional beds for more suspected patients in accordance with the "due diligence" requirement.

At present, 28 designated hospitals and Vulcan Mountain, Raytheon Mountain Hospital has become the main admission and treatment of critically ill patients.

According to an earlier interview with Academician Zhong Nanshan, the establishment of the Vulcan Mountain Hospital will mainly accept mild and suspected patients, thus making room for more serious patients in the original designated hospitals. As things stand, the positioning of Vulcan Mountain and Thor Mountain has changed. However, the construction of the intensive care unit, which requires more sophisticated medical equipment, has been much slower than in a shelter hospital.

As of 2400 hours on February 9, there were 16,902 confirmed cases in Wuhan, an increase of 1,620 from yesterday, according to data released by Wuhan Health Commission.

There are 3 open hospitals ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————. At the same time, a second batch of shelter hospitals is under construction, which is expected to have 6,700 beds, totaling about 11,100 beds.

At the same time, the city's 28 designated hospitals and the two mountain hospital total beds in 10,300, plus the first batch of 3 shelter hospital 4,400 beds, there is still a gap.

But as of 24:00 on February 9, designated hospitals and Vulcan Mountain, Raytheon Mountain Hospital left only 378 beds for critically ill patients, admission capacity is stretched.

As suspected cases are gradually diagnosed, the crucial contradiction that remains to be resolved in Landslide dam is the question of how to treat the elderly, like Xu, and how to treat the suspected seriously ill.
