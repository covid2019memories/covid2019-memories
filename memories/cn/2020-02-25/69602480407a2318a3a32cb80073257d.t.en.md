Wuhan, every day is different, every day has a strange new story, for example, the Epidemic Prevention Headquarters' document No. 18 directly abrogated the just-released document No. 17, using actions to explain "the changing of the day and night. " Of course, Wuhan moves more quickly, and it hasn't waited until nightfall, in the afternoon, he slaps himself in the face.

When document 17 first came out, everyone was very excited, opened a green channel, several colleagues forwarded to me, said I can return to Xi'an. Then document 18 immediately changed its tune, saying it still needed to be guarded. Other provinces and cities to resume full work, hard to control the epidemic, a few days are zero new, it is a critical period of digestion of infection stock, no one is willing to take the risk of taking away from the Han people. "sacrifice" a Hubei province has been the unbearable weight of the country, if the new provinces and cities spread, new pneumonia everywhere, the consequences unimaginable.

More and more Wuhan residents respond to buy food difficult, buy food expensive, I looked up alipay and wechat February bills, all buy food to pay, there is no other consumer spending. Friends are beginning to self-sufficiency in rural life, at Home Soaked Mung bean sprout, kind of Leek garlic, hydroponic lettuce, radish head buried in the soil to plant radish seedlings. She also self-grinding grain flour, do noodles steamed stuffed Bun, scallion cake, sesame dumplings, pumpkin hair cake, self-proclaimed as a master pastry, steamed stuffed Bun pucker like shape.

Today, she pulled out a packet of wine songs from her home and told me to start making rice wine and drinking it. She also made rice cakes. I felt like eating junk food and drinking milk tea. My friend immediately sent pictures saying that we could cook it at home. She cooks a pot of Yuanyang milk tea every day, too Bad we don't have tapioca, or we'd be rolling balls of Pearl. It is said that some communities have been able to order takeout KFC, friends rushed to send me screenshots, said to order KFC, small procedures in the order, the variety is very wide, they have near KFC everything, and Coke fries. I quickly opened my wechat account and found that all three KFC restaurants in our neighborhood had closed down. The anticipation turned to frustration. I sent her a string of Sour Lemon emojis. We've gone from making crazy jokes about work and projects, to sharing recipes and food, the latest news on the epidemic, where to shop, which stores are open, what time is it? Go get the order, all I could think about were the basic questions of eating, buying food, whether I had a fever or not. A few months ago, I couldn't have imagined that I would become an eschatologist.

I envy my friends for still being so enthusiastic and motivated to cook, and now I'm not in the mood to stay in the kitchen and study recipes, choosing the simplest stir fry. Wuhan residents are clearly divided into two groups. Some, like my friends, have suddenly become obsessed with cooking, cooking in different ways, trying many dishes that they have never cooked before, and some, like me, have lost their motivation to cook, people who have enough to eat (including some who can't afford to eat, can't buy food, and are frugal and prudent) . Usually do not want to cook is to feel trouble, a day or two can persist, do more than 10 days, and then face a pool to wash pots and pans, have put up their hands to surrender, began to miss the delivery of the past days. In fact, I still like the kitchen, cooking and washing dishes as a rare time to relax and relax, now simply not in the mood, to eat as a healthy body, improve immunity task, tell yourself to eat more, now many hospitals do not see non-pneumonia patients, medicine is not easy to buy, sick no place to see, very troublesome.

A few days ago, Wuhan sister-in-law complained, today our community also have a few aunts can not hold, last night to the vegetable set meal is very Gouda, 100 yuan of vegetables soaked in water, wet, not fresh, this temperature will not last long. Some people say lettuce cut is hollow, fibrous, very old hard to chew, some people say that the Artemisia bubble water soon rotten, but also complain about Cabbage Moss is very old, leaves yellow. Fortunately, we did not attack the responsible group purchase of the residents, but also repeatedly said she had to take the children and organize group purchase, very hard, need to understand each other. After consultation, we all agreed to the outside, ask for a refund business, the next time for a reliable business super, so as not to charge.

There were more and more stray cats in the neighborhood, and several cats came from the back park. The cats were starving to death, the garbage cans were empty, and no one came downstairs to feed them. Every now and then I went to deliver food, and one by one they ate quickly around a plastic bowl, the bowl was emptied in a few minutes. Spring has arrived, the cats are more restless, night call non-stop, I observed, almost all male cats, yesterday near the garage to see a three-colored female cat, very fresh face, is just run.

There was an orange cat who had lived in the community for several years. His front leg was broken, he was limping, he was dirty, he was covered in mud, his nose was scratched, it didn't look like he was fighting with other cats, i was afraid I was going to run away and get maimed, and I wanted to get close enough to see if his leg was infected, and I was scared, so I got under the car, and I got closer, and I climbed up the tree, and I hid in the leaves. I was a little surprised to see the cat still climbing the tree with no obstacles and a broken leg. I thought he could only move on flat ground, but he jumped up the tree and stared at me. Every time I see the stray cats in the neighborhood, I miss my cat even more. I just bought him a bag of food and a can of canned food, and it is far away.

I had just finished detective fiction's the Virgin by Akihito, the dark style of the novel, and the author had deliberately made the reader fall into a well dug hole with a vague narrative point of view, only to realize at the end that the style was similar to make do with good seedlings + Kakuta light times + Yi, what do you recommend.
