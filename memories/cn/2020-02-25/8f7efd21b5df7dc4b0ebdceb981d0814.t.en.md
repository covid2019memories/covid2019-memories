This is the first year that Liu Decheng, a beekeeper, takes his bees to spend the winter in Yunnan.

He used to breed bees in his native Xichang, where rape flowers flourished. But later, many people do not grow rape, to plant grapes, less flowers. He heard from his bee friend that Yunnan was nice and went there.

Beekeeper chasing around the flowering period run, called the transition. Once the flowers bloom in the spring, with 176 boxes of bees, Liu will leave Yimen County for his first stop in Mianyang. In February and March, there are large areas of rape flowers, waist-high, yellow, the bee swarm into, the shadow can not be seen.

In April, we headed west from Sichuan to Tianshui in Gansu Province, chasing canola, ACACIA and Alfalfa. ACACIA flowers in full bloom, saved in the branches, Acacia honey is also the best seller beekeepers honey.

Then there's Dingxi, silver, Wuwei. For the last bloom, he returns to Tianshui, circles an oval on the map, and in November or so sets off for Yunnan to breed bees and wait for the next bloom.

Only this year, the migration was cut off by the epidemic. Because of the new crown pneumonia, he encountered road closures in his village in Yimen County, Yunnan, and was unable to get the bees out of the fields in time. He was also unable to bring in feed sugar. The bees had to feed on the canola flowers, which had been sprayed with pesticides, and the worker bees died layer by layer.

During this time, there was another outbreak of Bee Mites. When treating bees for Mites, Liu Decheng used medicine, not only worker bees, small bees can not grow up, the bee farm has been completely collapsed, loss of one hundred thousand.

On Feb. 13, Liu Decheng, 45, ended his life with a piece of twine in a beekeeping tent. His original 176 hives eventually merged into 36 weaker colonies.

For Liu, in Yimen County, Yunnan Province, he was meant to spend a season without honey.

A few years ago, Liu Decheng's wife would follow him to chase flowers. Later, his two children grew up, one in high school and the other in junior high school, and they had to be taken care of. His wife found a temporary job in the supermarket in his hometown, lau Tak Shing alone with the bees around the migration.

Autumn and winter are the key period for the queen to lay eggs and breed the overwintering bees in large numbers. Even in Yunnan, where the flowers are more abundant than in Xichang, there is not enough food. There must be enough sugar for the bees, which do not have much honey, to survive the winter.

Over the winter, the beekeeper's Day is spent more like this: Morning Morning Dawn, cooked rice, check boxes of bees. Autumn and winter is a high incidence of Bee Mites, must always pay attention to remove MITES. Wait until the bees fly out before you can sit down to eat. At six or seven o'clock in the evening, the sun goes down, the temperature drops, the bees fly back on their own, they have to feed them sugar water.

Though no honey is produced, these months are still a hopeful time for Liu -- as the hive gathers the strength to sustain a new year.

At the end of January, Li Zhirong of Tianshui, Gansu Province, also made a phone call to Liu, who he called "master. ". "When you transfer to Mianyang, I'll drive up and see you, the two of us, my car, your bee, my bee, pull away together, I'll learn from you for years, this year we'll have a big fight. " Liu Decheng was still happy at the other end, he told Li Zhirong that he would take the bees to Mianyang, Sichuan, on February 20, and that he would call him then.

But on February 3rd, things took a turn for the worse. Liu Decheng sent a friend circle, said his bees were poisoned. Xu Renzhu, a busy bee in Panzhihua, Sichuan, saw it and chatted with him. That night, Liu Decheng told Xu Renzhu, from the third day of the Lunar New Year to now, just the dead bees, he filled six or seven barrels, have been dumped, it can hold forty catties of water bucket.

In early February, Liu Decheng made a video to show his friends the beehives and dead bees. Photo / interviewee

Xu Renzhu felt the same way. Because of the pneumonia epidemic, after the Chinese New Year holiday, farmers in Panzhihua could not go out to work as usual, they worked hard in the fields to produce pesticides, bees were poisoned more than ever before, and it used to be bees that opened their hives thickly, it's almost as if the worker bees are dead, and the queen is barely excited or able to reproduce after being poisoned.

Unable to stay in Panzhihua, Xu tried to go to Xindu to catch the flowers. He took his health pass and went to the same place he had stayed in the previous year. He agreed with the village chief that he would not leave the house until he had been isolated for 14 days. But the next day, a familiar villager found him in his tent, chased him away or smashed the hive. "I told them I was desperate, and they wouldn't let me go. I had no choice but to ask my friends to take me in. " Finally, it was a beekeeper friend who kept his bees in his apiary.

Lau's Yimen County is only worse. Village Road Closure, the road is set up cards, he could not find a car, sugar into the feed, he also can not get out, even if really can get out, Sichuan side also do not receive.

"But your bee is growing. " Xu Renzhu Comfort Liu Decheng, the effect is very small. "It's crazy, " Liu told him. He told Xu about the bees. "They're so dead, they can't even be dragged out. "

The conversation came to an abrupt end, and there was nothing they could do but talk about their losses, and comfort one another.

On February 15, the third day after Liu's departure, the relevant departments issued the "urgent notice on solving the current practical difficulties to speed up the resumption of production in the breeding industry. ". That includes bee transportation. With this document, the exit for the transition wasps only gradually began to open.

The life of a beekeeper is full of uncertainty.

If a year of good weather, honey bees in the honey source to eat satisfied, produce more honey; if the rain days, or meet "cold spring" such as extreme weather, honey source plants will reduce the flow of honey, will also affect the bees out and about.

Think here the flowering period has two months, may be 20 days to open up, the day is too hot, flowers open early on fall, can not gather honey, it has to move to the next place.

Every year is like a "gambling game" , gambling can make money.

This is not the first time Lau has lost a bet. In April 2018, Gansu Province was hit by freezing temperatures. Liu and other beekeepers were in the area during the flowering season, when temperatures plunged and pollen was damaged, leaving bees without honey to collect.

Can Not pick honey, bees can only eat sugar, a bag of 100 pounds of sugar at the time rose to nearly 400, a flowering period to feed more than 10 bags, and then, that most of the year, take the northwest flower line, almost along the road have been feeding sugar, income is not enough to pay ten thousand.

In addition to making a living, you have to be able to master the craft. Many beekeepers had to follow their master for four or five years before they could go on their own. We need to know what bees are like. We need to know how to treat them. The most common and dangerous disease of bees is the bee mite. In colonies with severe Mites, new bees can not be born healthy, adult bees die in large numbers, and the colony is rapidly weakened.

Bees can't tell when they have mites. For Liu Decheng, a beekeeper in Yimen County, one of the most important things to do every day is to check for Mites and bring up the comb of a beehive, which is made of thousands of hives made of bees'wax, look at the wings of the bee that climbs on it. If A bee's wing is twisted and bit into a hole, it's infested with Mites.

For MITES, only medicine. MITE medicine is also a pesticide, play less, the BEE MITE can not get rid of, play more, will poison their bees to death. Because each year the mite situation is different, can only estimate their own dosage, then skilled bee farmers will sometimes make a mistake.

Xu Renzhu last year for a new MITE drug, do not know the nature of the drug, played a no effect, but also a good turn after a fill, or bees will also be a big problem.

This time, it was Lau who made the mistake. After being unable to switch fields and being poisoned by bees, his colony was severely damaged by the MITE treatment and died in droves. Before the hive was opened there were still active bees, but then they were barely visible.

Over the past year, life's blows have come too often.

When chasing flowers last year, Liu Decheng asked Yang Chongfu for help. At the end of February, they set off from Xichang, Sichuan, to Mianyang to chase rape flowers. Yang Chongfu mainly helps Liu Decheng transfer, Cook and take care of bees. It costs 2,000 yuan a month. He thinks the salary is too low. Everyone else offers 3,000 or 4,000 yuan, and there are 5,000. He also asked Liu Decheng to raise his salary. Liu Decheng said, "it doesn't add up. ".

Yang Chongfu listened to his words, no longer cross-examine, he did not want to let the middle introducer embarrassed, less money on less. As for the reason, he could barely make heads or tails of it -- he had heard of the illness in his family.

In July and August last year, Liu Decheng's younger brother died of cancer. He left the bee farm in Yang Chongfu's care and went back to finish his brother's funeral. He did not return for more than half a month.

Liu Decheng to Yunnan after the bees, but also asked Yang Chongfu to help. Also this time, Liu mentioned that next May, after collecting the ACACIA flowers, he might sell the bees and go back to care for his father, Florida, who was on dialysis after suffering from kidney disease.

Beekeeper Liu Decheng, left few traces, outsiders only in a few short video, to be able to glimpse some aspects of his life.

On a short video platform, more than half of Lau's videos are of him singing, wearing headphones and facing the screen, occasionally singing and spinning, with tents, beehives and empty surroundings behind him.

"This is the life of a beekeeper, " Liu said without a smile or a curve in his mouth as the prelude to "don't cry, my friend. " It was January 13, one of the last videos he uploaded.

Liu Decheng in the Short Video Platform Upload the last video, cover "friends do not cry. ". Image / network

By the roadside, in the mountains, outside the village, on the grassland, are his foothold. After years of solar panels, Liu's tent has lights at night, can charge his cell phone, and has a small TV.

He likes to sing, and so does SEO. During the Spring Festival, many beekeepers did not stay at home for the New Year and did not watch TV. They just held their own party among the beekeepers. They sang one after another, singing "qinghai-tibet Plateau" , "the Loess Plateau" and "the song of the Peony" , some people give out red packets.

Life is lonely and hard. In the spring and summer, we have to check the hive every day, not only to see if there are any bee Mites, but also to shake out more amber honey; in the autumn and winter, it is difficult to find water outside, and we found it. We had to carry water every time, feed sugar water to the bees, and the bees had to consume a bucket of water every meal, water goes fast. When it's cloudy and rainy and the bees can't get out, the beekeeper has to worry in his tent and can't do anything.

At night, solar-powered Bulbs "Purr" sound, light can only be barely seen in the tent, tent outside has been cold, surrounded only by the sound of bees. One year, Xu Renzhu was caught in a storm, the tent was blown away, afraid to go out to find, only wet quilt covered his head, until dawn.

Bees like quiet, in addition to a large flower field nearby, there should be a clean water source. Try to avoid getting too close to people, so that bee stings don't cause problems. And we can't get too close to other fields, where a bee fight can kill a whole lot of bees in minutes. So beekeepers like Liu always live in remote places, rarely able to communicate with others, and can only sing. "If you don't open your mouth, you won't be able to speak, " Xu explained.

Liu raised Italian honeybees, a species of western bee that was later introduced to China. Italian bees are big, in groups, like a piece of flower field, do not like scattered flowers. If the local Bee (Chinese Bee) next to the field, it will cause trouble, the beekeeper will come to you out of the House, think your family bee to steal the pollen of my family bee.

He is soft-natured and does not like to quarrel with others. Once, his Italy Bee bit to kill a group of others in the peak, the other side let him lose money, he quickly agreed, lost three thousand. Later, speaking of this matter, Li Zhirong feel compensate more, want to help him get back, Liu Decheng stopped him: "Never Mind, not much, now to the other side of the village release bees, a small matter can cause a big problem, we have to plan for the future. "

Liu Decheng money after the third day, the other side called a few local beekeepers to find the door, forced him to move away. Li Zhirong to pull his bees to his home, but Liu Decheng did not agree, has been in the side said: "Yes, I can move. " He let the other side to give him some time, for the bees to find a new place.

He was a cautious man, willing to leave goodwill behind. People from the village came to buy honey, and he gave them half a catty for a pound of honey. He told Li Zhirong: "depending on money or rely on the big, not small, we have so many bees, where can not throw half a catty of honey? Beekeeping, is to eat to throw, to go, you have to look a little farther. "

Once his bees were stolen three boxes by the people in the next village. He rode over on his bicycle and chatted with some people over tea. He pretended to see the beehives as if they were his. The other side only said he had picked them up, but he didn't puncture them either. He took two boxes of bees and went back, the other box was left to someone else.

Despite their loneliness and hard work, "but beekeeping is also true freedom, " which is why they are still willing to stay in the industry.

Xu Renzhu said that sometimes several places are blooming, and he can choose a place with good scenery and good climate where he also likes to catch flowers, "chasing the flowering season is like chasing the spring. Most of the time we are in tents in our spring and autumn clothes. The air is nice and cool in the morning and at night. " Will eat on the grassland with everyone, drink highland barley wine. He and Liu Decheng met the year before last when they were chasing flowers on the grassland of Ruo'ergai, northwest of river.

Now, the flowers are about to open in Xindu, friends'bees have begun to gather powder, Xu Renzhu's bees or can only be kept with sugar water, he checks the queen every day, want to reproduce the swarm from scratch.

Last year's bee money was borrowed, and he still hasn't paid it off. This year, a queen costs over $80, and to restore the colony, he'll have to buy hundreds. But that day after hearing the news of Liu Decheng's suicide, he didn't sleep all night, and in the morning he contacted his fellow townsman to initiate a fund-raising, raising 2,160 yuan. He also donated 100 yuan, all to Liu Decheng's wife.

Later, Xu Renzhu wanted to raise some money for himself, hoping to buy some bees with the money. The beekeeper of the Beekeeper's union said that everyone had donated to Liu Decheng and was still working on the donation from Hubei. The beekeepers in the group could only do their best to donate more than 3,000 yuan to him.

On February 3rd, things took a turn for the worse. Liu Decheng sent a friend circle, said his bees were poisoned.

Xu Renzhu, a busy bee in Panzhihua, Sichuan, saw it and chatted with him. That night, Liu Decheng told Xu Renzhu, from the third day of the Lunar New Year to now, just the dead bees, he filled six or seven barrels, have been dumped, it can hold forty catties of water bucket. "going crazy. " He described to Xu Renzhu the plight of the bees: "The death is so thick that it can not be dragged out. "

Despite their loneliness and hard work, "but beekeeping is also true freedom, " which is why they are still willing to stay in the industry.

Xu Renzhu said that sometimes several places are blooming, and he can choose a place with good scenery and good climate where he also likes to catch flowers, "chasing the flowering season is like chasing the spring. Most of the time we are in tents in our spring and autumn clothes. The air is nice and cool in the morning and at night. " Will eat on the grassland with everyone, drink highland barley wine. He and Liu Decheng met the year before last when they were chasing flowers on the grassland of Ruo'ergai, northwest of river.

Now, the flowers are about to open in Xindu, friends'bees have begun to gather powder, Xu Renzhu's bees or can only be kept with sugar water, he checks the queen every day, want to reproduce the swarm from scratch.

Last year's bee money was borrowed, and he still hasn't paid it off. This year, a queen costs over $80, and to restore the colony, he'll have to buy hundreds. But that day after hearing the news of Liu Decheng's suicide, he didn't sleep all night, and in the morning he contacted his fellow townsman to initiate a fund-raising, raising 2,160 yuan. He also donated 100 yuan, all to Liu Decheng's wife.

Later, Xu Renzhu wanted to raise some money for himself, hoping to buy some bees with the money. The beekeeper of the Beekeeper's union said that everyone had donated to Liu Decheng and was still working on the donation from Hubei. The beekeepers in the group could only do their best to donate more than 3,000 yuan to him.

This is the first year that Liu Decheng, a beekeeper, takes his bees to spend the winter in Yunnan.

He used to breed bees in his native Xichang, where rape flowers flourished. But later, many people do not grow rape, to plant grapes, less flowers. He heard from his bee friend that Yunnan was nice and went there.

Beekeeper chasing around the flowering period run, called the transition. Once the flowers bloom in the spring, with 176 boxes of bees, Liu will leave Yimen County for his first stop in Mianyang. In February and March, there are large areas of rape flowers, waist-high, yellow, the bee swarm into, the shadow can not be seen.

In April, we headed west from Sichuan to Tianshui in Gansu Province, chasing canola, ACACIA and Alfalfa. ACACIA flowers in full bloom, saved in the branches, Acacia honey is also the best seller beekeepers honey.

Then there's Dingxi, silver, Wuwei. For the last bloom, he returns to Tianshui, circles an oval on the map, and in November or so sets off for Yunnan to breed bees and wait for the next bloom.

Only this year, the migration was cut off by the epidemic. Because of the new crown pneumonia, he encountered road closures in his village in Yimen County, Yunnan, and was unable to get the bees out of the fields in time. He was also unable to bring in feed sugar. The bees had to feed on the canola flowers, which had been sprayed with pesticides, and the worker bees died layer by layer.

During this time, there was another outbreak of Bee Mites. When treating bees for Mites, Liu Decheng used medicine, not only worker bees, small bees can not grow up, the bee farm has been completely collapsed, loss of one hundred thousand.

On Feb. 13, Liu Decheng, 45, ended his life with a piece of twine in a beekeeping tent. His original 176 hives eventually merged into 36 weaker colonies.

For Liu, in Yimen County, Yunnan Province, he was meant to spend a season without honey.

A few years ago, Liu Decheng's wife would follow him to chase flowers. Later, his two children grew up, one in high school and the other in junior high school, and they had to be taken care of. His wife found a temporary job in the supermarket in his hometown, lau Tak Shing alone with the bees around the migration.

Autumn and winter are the key period for the queen to lay eggs and breed the overwintering bees in large numbers. Even in Yunnan, where the flowers are more abundant than in Xichang, there is not enough food. There must be enough sugar for the bees, which do not have much honey, to survive the winter.

Over the winter, the beekeeper's Day is spent more like this: Morning Morning Dawn, cooked rice, check boxes of bees. Autumn and winter is a high incidence of Bee Mites, must always pay attention to remove MITES. Wait until the bees fly out before you can sit down to eat. At six or seven o'clock in the evening, the sun goes down, the temperature drops, the bees fly back on their own, they have to feed them sugar water.

Though no honey is produced, these months are still a hopeful time for Liu -- as the hive gathers the strength to sustain a new year.

At the end of January, Li Zhirong of Tianshui, Gansu Province, also made a phone call to Liu, who he called "master. ". "When you transfer to Mianyang, I'll drive up and see you, the two of us, my car, your bee, my bee, pull away together, I'll learn from you for years, this year we'll have a big fight. " Liu Decheng was still happy at the other end, he told Li Zhirong that he would take the bees to Mianyang, Sichuan, on February 20, and that he would call him then.

But on February 3rd, things took a turn for the worse. Liu Decheng sent a friend circle, said his bees were poisoned. Xu Renzhu, a busy bee in Panzhihua, Sichuan, saw it and chatted with him. That night, Liu Decheng told Xu Renzhu, from the third day of the Lunar New Year to now, just the dead bees, he filled six or seven barrels, have been dumped, it can hold forty catties of water bucket.

In early February, Liu Decheng made a video to show his friends the beehives and dead bees. Photo / interviewee

Xu Renzhu felt the same way. Because of the pneumonia epidemic, after the Chinese New Year holiday, farmers in Panzhihua could not go out to work as usual, they worked hard in the fields to produce pesticides, bees were poisoned more than ever before, and it used to be bees that opened their hives thickly, it's almost as if the worker bees are dead, and the queen is barely excited or able to reproduce after being poisoned.

Unable to stay in Panzhihua, Xu tried to go to Xindu to catch the flowers. He took his health pass and went to the same place he had stayed in the previous year. He agreed with the village chief that he would not leave the house until he had been isolated for 14 days. But the next day, a familiar villager found him in his tent, chased him away or smashed the hive. "I told them I was desperate, and they wouldn't let me go. I had no choice but to ask my friends to take me in. " Finally, it was a beekeeper friend who kept his bees in his apiary.

Lau's Yimen County is only worse. Village Road Closure, the road is set up cards, he could not find a car, sugar into the feed, he also can not get out, even if really can get out, Sichuan side also do not receive.

"But your bee is growing. " Xu Renzhu Comfort Liu Decheng, the effect is very small. "It's crazy, " Liu told him. He told Xu about the bees. "They're so dead, they can't even be dragged out. "

The conversation came to an abrupt end, and there was nothing they could do but talk about their losses, and comfort one another.

On February 15, the third day after Liu's departure, the relevant departments issued the "urgent notice on solving the current practical difficulties to speed up the resumption of production in the breeding industry. ". That includes bee transportation. With this document, the exit for the transition wasps only gradually began to open.

The life of a beekeeper is full of uncertainty.

If a year of good weather, honey bees in the honey source to eat satisfied, produce more honey; if the rain days, or meet "cold spring" such as extreme weather, honey source plants will reduce the flow of honey, will also affect the bees out and about.

Think here the flowering period has two months, may be 20 days to open up, the day is too hot, flowers open early on fall, can not gather honey, it has to move to the next place.

Every year is like a "gambling game" , gambling can make money.

This is not the first time Lau has lost a bet. In April 2018, Gansu Province was hit by freezing temperatures. Liu and other beekeepers were in the area during the flowering season, when temperatures plunged and pollen was damaged, leaving bees without honey to collect.

Can Not pick honey, bees can only eat sugar, a bag of 100 pounds of sugar at the time rose to nearly 400, a flowering period to feed more than 10 bags, and then, that most of the year, take the northwest flower line, almost along the road have been feeding sugar, income is not enough to pay ten thousand.

In addition to making a living, you have to be able to master the craft. Many beekeepers had to follow their master for four or five years before they could go on their own. We need to know what bees are like. We need to know how to treat them. The most common and dangerous disease of bees is the bee mite. In colonies with severe Mites, new bees can not be born healthy, adult bees die in large numbers, and the colony is rapidly weakened.

Bees can't tell when they have mites. For Liu Decheng, a beekeeper in Yimen County, one of the most important things to do every day is to check for Mites and bring up the comb of a beehive, which is made of thousands of hives made of bees'wax, look at the wings of the bee that climbs on it. If A bee's wing is twisted and bit into a hole, it's infested with Mites.

For MITES, only medicine. MITE medicine is also a pesticide, play less, the BEE MITE can not get rid of, play more, will poison their bees to death. Because each year the mite situation is different, can only estimate their own dosage, then skilled bee farmers will sometimes make a mistake.

Xu Renzhu last year for a new MITE drug, do not know the nature of the drug, played a no effect, but also a good turn after a fill, or bees will also be a big problem.

This time, it was Lau who made the mistake. After being unable to switch fields and being poisoned by bees, his colony was severely damaged by the MITE treatment and died in droves. Before the hive was opened there were still active bees, but then they were barely visible.

Over the past year, life's blows have come too often.

When chasing flowers last year, Liu Decheng asked Yang Chongfu for help. At the end of February, they set off from Xichang, Sichuan, to Mianyang to chase rape flowers. Yang Chongfu mainly helps Liu Decheng transfer, Cook and take care of bees. It costs 2,000 yuan a month. He thinks the salary is too low. Everyone else offers 3,000 or 4,000 yuan, and there are 5,000. He also asked Liu Decheng to raise his salary. Liu Decheng said, "it doesn't add up. ".

Yang Chongfu listened to his words, no longer cross-examine, he did not want to let the middle introducer embarrassed, less money on less. As for the reason, he could barely make heads or tails of it -- he had heard of the illness in his family.

In July and August last year, Liu Decheng's younger brother died of cancer. He left the bee farm in Yang Chongfu's care and went back to finish his brother's funeral. He did not return for more than half a month.

Liu Decheng to Yunnan after the bees, but also asked Yang Chongfu to help. Also this time, Liu mentioned that next May, after collecting the ACACIA flowers, he might sell the bees and go back to care for his father, Florida, who was on dialysis after suffering from kidney disease.

Beekeeper Liu Decheng, left few traces, outsiders only in a few short video, to be able to glimpse some aspects of his life.

On a short video platform, more than half of Lau's videos are of him singing, wearing headphones and facing the screen, occasionally singing and spinning, with tents, beehives and empty surroundings behind him.

"This is the life of a beekeeper, " Liu said without a smile or a curve in his mouth as the prelude to "don't cry, my friend. " It was January 13, one of the last videos he uploaded.

Liu Decheng in the Short Video Platform Upload the last video, cover "friends do not cry. ". Image / network

By the roadside, in the mountains, outside the village, on the grassland, are his foothold. After years of solar panels, Liu's tent has lights at night, can charge his cell phone, and has a small TV.

He likes to sing, and so does SEO. During the Spring Festival, many beekeepers did not stay at home for the New Year and did not watch TV. They just held their own party among the beekeepers. They sang one after another, singing "qinghai-tibet Plateau" , "the Loess Plateau" and "the song of the Peony" , some people give out red packets.

Life is lonely and hard. In the spring and summer, we have to check the hive every day, not only to see if there are any bee Mites, but also to shake out more amber honey; in the autumn and winter, it is difficult to find water outside, and we found it. We had to carry water every time, feed sugar water to the bees, and the bees had to consume a bucket of water every meal, water goes fast. When it's cloudy and rainy and the bees can't get out, the beekeeper has to worry in his tent and can't do anything.

At night, solar-powered Bulbs "Purr" sound, light can only be barely seen in the tent, tent outside has been cold, surrounded only by the sound of bees. One year, Xu Renzhu was caught in a storm, the tent was blown away, afraid to go out to find, only wet quilt covered his head, until dawn.

Bees like quiet, in addition to a large flower field nearby, there should be a clean water source. Try to avoid getting too close to people, so that bee stings don't cause problems. And we can't get too close to other fields, where a bee fight can kill a whole lot of bees in minutes. So beekeepers like Liu always live in remote places, rarely able to communicate with others, and can only sing. "If you don't open your mouth, you won't be able to speak, " Xu explained.

Liu raised Italian honeybees, a species of western bee that was later introduced to China. Italian bees are big, in groups, like a piece of flower field, do not like scattered flowers. If the local Bee (Chinese Bee) next to the field, it will cause trouble, the beekeeper will come to you out of the House, think your family bee to steal the pollen of my family bee.

He is soft-natured and does not like to quarrel with others. Once, his Italy Bee bit to kill a group of others in the peak, the other side let him lose money, he quickly agreed, lost three thousand. Later, speaking of this matter, Li Zhirong feel compensate more, want to help him get back, Liu Decheng stopped him: "Never Mind, not much, now to the other side of the village release bees, a small matter can cause a big problem, we have to plan for the future. "

Liu Decheng money after the third day, the other side called a few local beekeepers to find the door, forced him to move away. Li Zhirong to pull his bees to his home, but Liu Decheng did not agree, has been in the side said: "Yes, I can move. " He let the other side to give him some time, for the bees to find a new place.

He was a cautious man, willing to leave goodwill behind. People from the village came to buy honey, and he gave them half a catty for a pound of honey. He told Li Zhirong: "depending on money or rely on the big, not small, we have so many bees, where can not throw half a catty of honey? Beekeeping, is to eat to throw, to go, you have to look a little farther. "

Once his bees were stolen three boxes by the people in the next village. He rode over on his bicycle and chatted with some people over tea. He pretended to see the beehives as if they were his. The other side only said he had picked them up, but he didn't puncture them either. He took two boxes of bees and went back, the other box was left to someone else.

Despite their loneliness and hard work, "but beekeeping is also true freedom, " which is why they are still willing to stay in the industry.

Xu Renzhu said that sometimes several places are blooming, and he can choose a place with good scenery and good climate where he also likes to catch flowers, "chasing the flowering season is like chasing the spring. Most of the time we are in tents in our spring and autumn clothes. The air is nice and cool in the morning and at night. " Will eat on the grassland with everyone, drink highland barley wine. He and Liu Decheng met the year before last when they were chasing flowers on the grassland of Ruo'ergai, northwest of river.

Now, the flowers are about to open in Xindu, friends'bees have begun to gather powder, Xu Renzhu's bees or can only be kept with sugar water, he checks the queen every day, want to reproduce the swarm from scratch.

Last year's bee money was borrowed, and he still hasn't paid it off. This year, a queen costs over $80, and to restore the colony, he'll have to buy hundreds. But that day after hearing the news of Liu Decheng's suicide, he didn't sleep all night, and in the morning he contacted his fellow townsman to initiate a fund-raising, raising 2,160 yuan. He also donated 100 yuan, all to Liu Decheng's wife.

Later, Xu Renzhu wanted to raise some money for himself, hoping to buy some bees with the money. The beekeeper of the Beekeeper's union said that everyone had donated to Liu Decheng and was still working on the donation from Hubei. The beekeepers in the group could only do their best to donate more than 3,000 yuan to him.

Beekeeper Liu Decheng, left few traces, outsiders only in a few short video, to be able to glimpse some aspects of his life.

Despite their loneliness and hard work, "but beekeeping is also true freedom, " which is why they are still willing to stay in the industry.

Xu Renzhu said that sometimes several places are blooming, and he can choose a place with good scenery and good climate where he also likes to catch flowers, "chasing the flowering season is like chasing the spring. Most of the time we are in tents in our spring and autumn clothes. The air is nice and cool in the morning and at night. " Will eat on the grassland with everyone, drink highland barley wine. He and Liu Decheng met the year before last when they were chasing flowers on the grassland of Ruo'ergai, northwest of river.

Now, the flowers are about to open in Xindu, friends'bees have begun to gather powder, Xu Renzhu's bees or can only be kept with sugar water, he checks the queen every day, want to reproduce the swarm from scratch.

Last year's bee money was borrowed, and he still hasn't paid it off. This year, a queen costs over $80, and to restore the colony, he'll have to buy hundreds. But that day after hearing the news of Liu Decheng's suicide, he didn't sleep all night, and in the morning he contacted his fellow townsman to initiate a fund-raising, raising 2,160 yuan. He also donated 100 yuan, all to Liu Decheng's wife.

Later, Xu Renzhu wanted to raise some money for himself, hoping to buy some bees with the money. The beekeeper of the Beekeeper's union said that everyone had donated to Liu Decheng and was still working on the donation from Hubei. The beekeepers in the group could only do their best to donate more than 3,000 yuan to him.
