Left, right, and so on came the 20th. Yesterday Wuhan realized new additions and suspected double zero. The city was closed for nearly two months. For the first time, it felt like "soon. " Although on the night of the 18th, when we talked with friends, we bet that the 19th would definitely be zero, because the 20th suddenly reported 0 is false, a few days ago are 1, it seems to be for this hard-won 0 to pave the way.

On the 19th, the news came that Wuhan had dropped to zero. There are also questions about whether there is really no new addition, and I have doubts about this figure, including the news that all the shelters have been closed in the last few days, and that patients who require to be cured will be placed in concentrated isolation for another 14 days, and that they may regain Yang again, let me put a big question mark on "discharge criteria. ".

However, the pressure of resuming work and production is great, and the people's lives are under great pressure. Hubei has stagnated for a quarter. This year, I am afraid it is very laborious. Just opened the military games, the money has not had time to recover, catch up with the new outbreak of pneumonia, continue to dig. Happened to see a piece of news, Hubei Infrastructure Projects to reduce the capital ratio, from GM's 20% to 15% , more leverage, but also reflect the side is really "Kidney" , the body was hollowed out.

Cross-provincial traffic should have to wait until April. The News we have seen in the past few days is not very optimistic. We thought everything was fine outside of Hubei Province. However, we did not expect that other provinces would not allow traffic to pass. When we saw the license plate of Hubei A, we all urged them to come back, not even a green health code. Another returned to Xi'an to study abroad. The hotel in central isolation was very poor. The charge was 140 yuan a day. Just looking at the pictures, I was so obsessed with cleanliness that it was hard to imagine spending 14 days in a place like a basement. I couldn't sit still for half a day. The Isolation Hotel happened to be in the same district as me. I thought of what I would do if I was dragged back to this hotel. My eagerness to return to Xi'an was immediately poured into my heart.

My family told me not to worry, first wait and see, wait and see inside and outside the province are stable then say, recently the policy has changed too quickly, one day by one, who knows what I will go back to what stringent requirements. Also said that I did not learn a driving license, there is a car anywhere convenient, now can take the national road back, I do not want to drive or cherish life, for fear of becoming a road killer, on the road on the rear-end collision.

: : At present, there is still no official announcement of any lifting of the closure, and I do not know if there will be any official documents later and there is no proof that it is still impossible to leave the community. Many businesses are waiting for the official resumption of work next Monday, waiting to see the resumption of Public Transport News, in the middle of this weekend, presumably the government should be "hurry to study. ".

Community just got free fish, property and contact with free lettuce, vegetable garden in Huangpi District district, vegetables can not sell, while not rotten in the field, call the community out of the car to collect. Our community group just said that they would ask volunteers to go to the fields to chop vegetables. They gathered at 7:30 in the morning and asked themselves to bring knives, small stools, lunch and mineral water. I was hesitant to sign up. The secretary immediately replied that everyone was too active, and the five places were already full, did Not Report on the residents are very sorry, we are bad, a can go outside to breathe, you can also go to the field chop vegetables, as a farm, free spring outing.

Later heard that people say, really like farmhouse, everyone squatting in the field, with a knife Shua chopping lettuce, when anger, tired on the shed outside rest. In the shed next door, there are chopping teams from other communities, dressed in neat t-shirts, wearing banner banners, playing loud music and shouting slogans.

The van pulled several hundred pieces of lettuce, and the plastic sheets were spread on the ground. I saw the crowd calling for volunteers again. They quickly put on masks and went downstairs to help. Four pieces of lettuce were put into a plastic bag, and a total of several hundred bags were filled. They were then distributed door to door in the floor holes, the weather is very hot, wearing hoodie run a few times, hot sweat, patting the door, there is a feeling of their own snow aunt possession, afraid that the house did not hear, patted very hard. Volunteers can go home after the dishes are divided, the community grid staff more hard, they also have to clean up, the ground dropped leaves into the garbage can.

Just delivered lettuce, afternoon and someone called to get rice, said the street sent free rice, everyone has, sent to the unit at the door to sign for. There are three kinds of rice, northeast rice, Thai fragrant rice, national treasure bridge rice, randomly distributed, our family is the Thai rice, the kind of slender, just my parents love to eat. After the rice is distributed, we are going to have a rest for a while, news has come from the property, there are 100 grass carp, first come, first served, come and get it, my father just went downstairs to pick up the rice, my mother went downstairs to get the fish, the residents are aware of the interval of three to five meters in line, one by one to get the love grass carp. Grass carp is still alive, in plastic bags bouncing around, catch food, many people around Fried Apron, wearing sleeves ran downstairs, worried that late there is no live fish.

I said we had enough to eat, there was no need to go downstairs and get another fish, give the opportunity to others, the family felt that there are supplies or to fight for, finally brought back grass carp about two catties, it feels like a long time to eat. We all complained about the sudden release of so many things in one day. It must be that the rescue teams from other provinces are withdrawing one after another. The supplies donated by the earlier stage are piled up like mountains and can not be consumed. Seeing the epidemic coming to an end, why don't we just give a little to each community and give it all to the citizens, other countries have begun to give residents cash subsidies, Wuhan no extra money subsidies, the meaning of some means of living supplies.

These few days in mobile phone to see the house, in advance to understand the rent around the headquarters, the headquarters building in remote areas, the lack of peripheral support, in the chain home and Shell to see the average price, there is a simple decoration, the rent for a one-bedroom with all the household appliances is comparable to that of my home in Xi'an, but the location of the House in Xi'an is good, and life is convenient, so it's not like going shopping and going to the city. Later, I thought, if there's no suitable apartment nearby, I'll look around Guanggu or Huake, it's just a few subway stops, within acceptable commuting distance.

In an article about the new coronavirus nucleic acid test, Guo shell asked the Hubei Examiner to tell her daily life. The narrator, Nan Zhi, felt the sound of the dimensional wall cracking. Danmei circle should have heard of this writer's wife, who has been writing for many years and is highly productive. When I was still reading Danmei, Nanzhi focused on writing fake sweet essays about strength and weakness, weakness, contortion and arrogance, i don't know if I've changed my style. I remember reading the last one called "captive" , Abo series, at the end of which I spit blood. At that time, I was mad at the author for forcing him. There was also an article called "heart tip nevus. " It was also the end that made me feel depressed. I just looked it up. They were all 16,17-year-old articles, AH, once again feeling that youth is no longer.

Anyway, Nan Zhi is a doctor of microbiology who specializes in pathogenic microorganism testing. She used to write about her daily laboratory life in the words of the author when she was more literary. This time, she stopped writing her column for many more days, look at her writing long hours in a negative pressure laboratory testing, respiratory distress, insufficient oxygen to the brain, sleep disorders, to the mental health task force to apply for sleeping pills, or want to say too hard, I wish the works sell. I remember I used to like a writer's wife, who was a little bit of a writer, and her work was not very popular. Her main occupation was teaching children. She worked with children during the day and wrote articles at night, so she was very fond of writing healing works. Later, when her teaching job got busier and busier, she also had a baby, combined with the crackdown in Jinjiang, the writer abandoned all the writers I had pursued over the years. First Look at love, then into the pit, now feel unrealistic, how life can happen, never pursued the novel, and the elderly, also do not want to see the masochism of the plot.

The epidemic situation in China is basically stable (if not stable, then stable) . There is an excess of production capacity for health products such as face masks and protective clothing. In early February, "one mask is hard to find. " Now, ordinary surgical masks can be bought on various e-commerce platforms. The surplus can be donated to countries where the epidemic is serious, this time also left a poem on the box, not only dry refueling.

There's a moment to move on all fronts and a reshape global order / Maneuver International Leadership in China. The author doesn't think it's going to shake up the system, but the performance during the outbreak can add a lot of points, to win the favor of European countries. One Takeaway: If you've publicly declared Chinese Virus time and time again, how about a Trump Pandemic Recession.

Finally, we share Zhou Lian's old article "my peace and reconciliation" : today, the so-called dispute between the Chinese model and the Western model still continues... when a negative event occurs, people always have to look for the reason for understanding, according to Hyde, the founder of attribution theory, people and actors tend to resort to "situational reasons" -- that is, they don't have anything to do with me Observers and naysayers tend to fall back on the "temperamental reason" -- it's all your fault. The former shirks the responsibility, the latter imposes it.

It is reasonable that the minister (actor) must be partial to what I have, and it is his duty to take his own side. As for the thinker (The Observer) , he will not hesitate to stand on the side of excellence, that is, good. What is our identity when we weigh up my complex relationship with his, good and bad? Must Good things be mine? Must Good things be mine?

The beauty of self-identity is that it not only elevates me into myself, but it can also, in axiology, further transform me into something good.
