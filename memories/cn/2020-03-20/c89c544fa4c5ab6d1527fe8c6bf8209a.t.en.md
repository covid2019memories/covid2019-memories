"There's no head that won't fall, " Liu said a few days after liquidating 002838.SZ  shares in a group of hundreds.

Over the past month and a half, this small and medium-sized board stock has continued to entice and stimulate investors. Between frequent hand-to-hand, early low-level entry may have made a lot of money, but many chase into the stock, perhaps still shiver at the top of the hill.

At 15:00 on March 19, dawn shares fell by the daily limit again. On the disk, the whole day K line trend is like a lifeless ecg, where the mask concept plate is also a wailing.

The slump in recent days follows a surge in dawn shares. Count Leopold Joseph von Daun shares closed at 11.46 yuan on Jan. 23, the last trading day before the Lunar New Year holiday, after peaking at 12.4 yuan for the whole of January. On February 3rd, panic-stricken a shares resumed trading, and on the same day more than 3,200 stocks in the two markets fell by the daily limit —— but the flu-fighting concept stock bucked the trend, and dawn quickly became a star and began its dazzling journey.

The stock gained 18 trading limits in the 34 trading days since the holiday, which ended on March 19, and hit an intraday high of 62.5 yuan on March 10, up 309 percent from its 2017 offering price. In the atmosphere of the spread of speculation, dawn shares price-earnings ratio from then 23 times, once more than 140 times.

During the same period, dawn's shares oscillated by more than 10 per cent for 10 days, meaning the market was volatile. Despite seven announcements of unusual stock movements, the Star Company's popularity has not waned.

Seek your fortune in the midst of danger.

Liu Chuan specially set up a dawn stock group, in which he constantly share information to the group members to provide operational advice. Before the outbreak, dawn shares and its plastics business were not as hot as they have been recently. At the end of the third quarter of last year, it had just 7,005 shareholders. However, Dow's popularity in the a-share market has shot up because of its involvement in mask-making.

The Stock Bar has become very lively, envy, suspicion and wait-and-see shareholders, almost every day after hours are constantly post discussion. "I bought it for about 38 yuan, but I sold it a week later, afraid I was too high to take it, " one investor told a "business figure. ".

The style of cooking oil with fire changed on March 10. Although the share price in the session reached the highest level in years, but that day dawn shares unexpectedly fell by the limit. Over the next few trading days, the stock turned downward, dropping by its daily limit several times. As of March 19, its shares had lost 35 percent of their value at the March 9 closing price, wiping nearly 7 billion yuan off the market value in circulation. However, during the sharp pullback, the capital inflow and outflow of Dow shares still occasionally rose, as if it was the torture caused by this shock, so that to hold on or cut off the flesh left, many investors have become torture.

Liu, who has sold his shares in Dawn, has turned his attention to other sectors. And the Stock Group from time to time some people directly regret that failed to sell stop-loss; more in the vicinity of 62 yuan, or can only continue in situ helpless "guard. ".

Two

Founded in 2002, the main products are Thermoplastic Elastomer, modified plastics and color masterbatch, mainly used in the automotive industry, household appliances, health care and other fields. In January 2017, the Chemical Company, based in Longkou, northern Shandong Peninsula, listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange's small and medium-sized board.

Yu Xiaoning and Han Limei, the real owners of dawn holdings, started in 1991 as a small mall with a few people and have now made the list of the country's richest people. According to the Hurun Rich List 2019, they ranked 1,148 with a wealth of 3.6 billion yuan, while dawn group, which owns dawn shares, ranked 424th in China's top 500 private enterprises with 20.9 billion yuan in revenue last year and 58th in the province.

Yu Xiaoning holds many titles, including deputy to the Shandong Provincial People's Congress, vice-chairman of the China Synthetic Resin Supply and Marketing Association, Vice-chairman of the Yantai Federation of Industry and Commerce, and President of the Yantai All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and Plastics Chamber of Commerce.

Dawn Holdings was in a fairly niche industry. In the capital market, this lack of imagination space, the concept of low-value speculation stocks, is not very noticeable. For the past year, Dawn's share price has hovered in the $20 range, which is uneventful. On January 18 this year, Yu Xiaoning also regularly attended the Shandong Provincial People's Congress. It wasn't until a few days later, when the outbreak broke out, that the low-key manufacturer, a key player in the mask industry chain, was quickly exposed to the market.

Medical Masks are usually composed of three layers, the inner and outer layers are non-woven fabric, the most critical middle layer is meltblown cloth, play a role in filtering, shielding and insulation. In 2018, the national output was only 53,500 tons, with a daily output of about 180 tons. In addition to masks, these melt-blown fabrics are also used for environmentally friendly materials, battery separators and clothing materials. In addition, due to the expensive production equipment, production line commissioning cycle (generally need 3-5 months) , so compared with the number of mask manufacturers downstream, the number of domestic meltblown cloth manufacturers is not much.

This directly led to the current market shortage of meltblown cloth. The price rose from around 20,000 yuan a ton before the outbreak to five hundred thousand at one point. Even if the industry has adjusted, but according to Longzhong information latest data, meltblown cloth spot is still tight, high still maintain at about 300,000 yuan / ton.

Amid the tensions, dawn shares are starting to gain traction.

As a maker of spray-blown raw material -- Foshan -- polypropylene spray-blown speciality material, dawn's share market share is said to be as high as 40% . In an earlier interview with China Entrepreneur, Yu said the company had been ordering only about 100 tons of melt-blown material a day, but the surge in orders since the end of January has seriously outstripped the production capacity of Dow shares. He had to spin off the other products and expand the original eight production lines to 21, all for fusing. According to a local newspaper in Longkou, Yu also turned to CNPC's sales leadership to increase the purchase of 1,300 tons of raw materials for fusing to solve production pressure.

Three

A broker who studied Dow shares last year told "business people" that it was an absolute industry leader until Sinopec recently got involved in melt-blown material production. "This is a 'state mission' for Sinopec, which is not bad for Count Leopold Joseph von Daun and will help the industry to become more regulated. In fact, the main focus of dawn shares is the thermoplastic elastomer business, this time the The Wrong Mans has put the formerly unprofitable modified plastics business, such as the melt-blown materials business, into action."

Financial data show that Jell-o is indeed not the main source of revenue for Dow -- its sales accounted for only about 20% of total revenue last year. A day before the March 10 crash, Dow had issued a "warning" to the market, saying that meltblown materials accounted for a small proportion of revenue, while other major products are also suffering from the impact of the epidemic.

"When I looked at the company, it wasn't expensive, it was only worth about $3 billion, and it was only worth over $100 million. I felt it was growing well, so I kept looking, " the broker recalled. In the current turbulent market, the total market value of dawn shares has more than 16 billion yuan. At the heart of the epidemic, amid all the hype, the face mask concept has changed.

Those who are experiencing the baptism of this wave of wealth are undoubtedly Yu Xiaoning and Han Limei. Currently, Yu Xiaoning indirectly owns 48.51% of dawn through dawn group, while Han Limei owns 21.08% . Together, they hold nearly 70% of dawn. Based on the closing price on the last trading day before the holiday, the total market value of its holdings is about 3.2 billion yuan. At 62.5 yuan, the couple's wealth soared to 17.5 billion yuan. But as share prices continue to fall, the tantalising paper riches and honor is shrinking.

On Feb. 12, Count Leopold Joseph von Daun announced that Ms. Han and two other executives planned to reduce their holdings by 3.26 percent. From the reduction can be implemented on March 4, so far, whether they have had operations in the secondary market is unknown. On the contrary, there are associates of Dow, as the spouse of a single director invested 1.5 million yuan on March 10, at a cost of about 53.1 yuan per share, perhaps anticipating the next rally.

In terms of performance, Count Leopold Joseph von Daun shares are still growing at a significant rate. In 2018 and 2019, its revenue was 1.363 billion yuan and 2.733 billion yuan respectively, and its net profit was 122 million yuan and 168 million yuan respectively. Due to the positive impact of the epidemic on the performance, some market organizations even boldly predicted that dawn shares this year and next year's net profit will exceed 400 million yuan.

But whether the short-term effects of the epidemic can continue to push up share prices is another question. Unlike the frenzied meltblown cloth market, dow produced meltblown material, the overall market price even fell. Longzhong information statistics show that the domestic prices of melt-blown fuel dropped from 15,000 yuan / ton to 13,000 yuan / ton this week, the lowest price has hit about 12,500 yuan / ton.

In fact, is not at the center of the storm Dawn shares, but in the capital market under the emotional turmoil, the stock price was "fried to the sky. ".

Wanton

In the past two months, the previously underserved mask industry has become a money-printing machine, and the a-share market has witnessed the torrid growth of concept stocks.

The participants came in droves. Even BYD Company, who has built cars diligently for years, has turned into the world's largest mask manufacturer. Now in the streets of Shenzhen, "byd brand" masks are continuously supplied at a fair price.

Buffett's old partner, Charlie Munger, said that if you can't accept a 50% share price, you're not a good investor. The recent wild swings in dawn shares have played out in similar ways. Feel the stimulation, "mask concept stock" is over the question, is hovering over the anxious market.

Interestingly, in order to combat the epidemic, recently announced high-profile involvement in the production of melt-blown material, melt-blown cloth and mask full chain of Sinopec, but the stock price has been hovering between just four to five yuan, to maintain "emotional stability. ". I don't get a share in the stock market.

Picking on an honest man.
