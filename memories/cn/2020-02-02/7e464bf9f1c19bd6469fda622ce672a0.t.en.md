By Zhang Youfa

The public opinion field in China during the anti-epidemic period continued to exhibit complexity, and in a more staring way.

After the release of great emotional pressure on New Year's Eve, from the next day (January 25) , the overall public opinion field tends to be stable and positive: the focus of the "first public opinion field" lies in the controllable overall situation, active epidemic prevention and the dedication of medical personnel, especially the positive changes that have taken place in Wuhan and Hubei; in the permitted discourse space, the focus of the public media in the "second public opinion field" lies in the concern for people, especially for the fate of individual characters in a crisis.

Objectively, "the first public opinion field" began to rise in power, to January 27, "the first public opinion field" discourse power and influence has been more fully played. "Unity and unity, unity and unity" has become the mainstream of public opinion in China. For "the second public opinion field" , after 4 days of brief activity, Sharp and noisy, it has to enter another phase. The space they have in the midst of this epidemic is also gradually being determined.

Social Media has returned to the context and expression it has become accustomed to, from regional attacks on Hubei and Wuhan in panic, to cyber-bullying in the name of refuting rumors, to campaigns for donations and epidemic prevention.

Although some people care about the situation, some people care about "people" , but in the field of public opinion, we have begun to unite together.

The big picture

Starting from January 25, in terms of leading actions, the official media began to send out positive signals to upgrade the prevention and control of the epidemic, and to pay more attention to the positive changes in the epidemic. In terms of controlling actions, the rumor governance mechanism has become more active and strict, and relevant social media platforms have also strengthened their censorship and punishment.

For example, on January 25, the WECHAT Security Center officially released a notice on the special treatment of rumors related to COVID-19 pneumonia on the same day, to dispel rumors by introducing professional third party rumor dispelling agencies, and depending on the extent of the violation of the account for stepped punishment, including but not limited to the account or account function for a limited period or permanent ban processing.

On January 27, Weibo also banned 35 accounts for name calling and cyber-bullying, including the active "Eagle of God" in the media arena over the past year.

On January 26, the relevant departments pointed out that "to promote the online formation of a strong positive energy, helping each other to fight the epidemic" , "for the prevention and control of the epidemic to create a good atmosphere on the Internet" became the meaning of the topic.

In today's media environment, the dissemination of special information is often associated with so-called "rumors" . Through the strict ban mechanism on new media constraints and discipline, to a certain extent, led to the "second field of public opinion" began to shrink in space.

At the same time, the discussion about the mechanism behind the rumor also stays more in the dissemination and the legal principle. On January 27, "thoughts on communication" published an old article, "rumors as a social protest, " which mentioned that rumors may also be an effort to reach an agreement on what is "true. ". If information is tightly controlled in a social order and the demand for news is greater than the supply of information through institutional channels, rumours will proliferate.

On January 28th the Supreme People's Court published an article saying that law enforcement agencies should give full play to the subjective evil formation and cognitive ability of information publishers and disseminators in the face of false information. As long as the information is basically true, the publisher and disseminator have no malicious intention, and the behavior objectively does not cause serious harm, we should maintain a tolerant attitude to such "false information" .

The sensationalist retweets in the "Forum 1" , such as the 1.4 billion flag Flag of the People's Republic of China during the Hong Kong incident, did not cause much of a stir this time. What can really spread is information about the epidemic, such as the People's Daily's "urgent search for people! These trains and flights have new-type pneumonia patients" .

In the face of a changing epidemic, the public demand for information far exceeds the choice of position and mood.

The state media are also deliberately increasing the amount of information they can export to the general public and their centralisation. For example, the vaccine is being developed! Xinhua news agency posted on Wechat on Jan. 26! Here are 30 good things to know, and the Jan. 27 issue of together against the plague! These news asks you to pay attention to", January 28 issue"FIGHT EPIDEMIC SITUATION!"! Follow these 20 messages.

At the same time, such media began to expand the focus of the disaster area, gradually attention and influence the previous propaganda blind spot. It must be pointed out that the "second public opinion field" has been on the call. For example, People's Daily published "parents, obey! Prevent new type pneumonia, please listen to six words of advice" and "Urgent Appeal! Prevent and control the epidemic, don't leave out the countryside! " On the 25th and 26th, the target of attention and mobilization is the middle-aged and the elderly and the rural population.

CCTV also stepped up its coverage of the outbreak after Jan. 25. At 9:30 pm on the 26th, the CCTV-13 broadcast a special program titled "War Epidemic" , which mainly covered the official announcement of the epidemic and the situation report on the front line. At this time, in the entertainment channel broadcast, the bottom also appears the epidemic health alert scrolling information. The News investigation, which played a major role in the fight against SARS 17 years ago, was announced on January 26 by its program team to go to Wuhan.

On January 28, the Publicity Department of the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) coordinated the programming of national satellite television every day to guide the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control reporting, the reduction of entertainment programming, and the timely issuance of guidelines for all-day programming by 36 satellite television stations. In addition to Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Anhui, Chongqing and other provincial-level satellite TV has launched the fight against the epidemic news live broadcast programs and special reports, timely release of authoritative information.

The density of government press conferences has also increased. At a press conference held on the afternoon of January 26, the director of the health commission, Ma Xiaowei, admitted that the current virus has become more transmissible and the epidemic situation is serious and complex. Political commentator Blogger "chairman rabbit" praised the event on Weibo, saying: "The event did a good job. It's a lot of information. "

Experts with prestige and trust in the hearts of the people have also set up micro-blogs, or appeared in interviews with the media, will be rational in line with the requirements of order to pass out the voice, to calm the people's mood and strengthen the will of the people.

However, a failed press conference can, to a large extent, trigger a backlash against public opinion, undermining the "first public opinion field" efforts to build consistency. On the evening of January 26, the performance of three local officials in Hubei who played an important role in the outbreak at a press conference triggered a huge public opinion backlash again.

Blocking and filtering major news comment areas has always been an effective way for officials to guard against the extremes of speech, but at the time of this news release, figures and opinions that might otherwise have been blocked by convention also appeared in the comment section, the comment section of the mainstream media was opened up to the disaffected public.

On the night of January 27th, the Mayor of Wuhan admitted in a CCTV interview that the information had not been released in time and offered his own explanation. For the first time, the embattled official has spoken publicly about putting his political future ahead of the broader need to fight the epidemic. But this seemingly selfless and fearless statement is not understood by the general public.

In the public opinion demand of promoting positive energy in the fight against the epidemic, some local media rely on the mode of "sacrificing the little to become the big" , which is not only difficult to have a positive incentive effect on the people, instead, he was accused of being "cold-blooded and heartless" .

For example, an article in the Hubei Daily entitled "Recall! Medical workers in Yichang Walk 70 miles back to hospital" was widely criticized. "Recalling medical personnel but not arranging vehicles, and allowing people to walk 35 kilometers to the hospital, are quite proud of this kind of propaganda. This is the style of propaganda in Hubei Province, " commented Weibo's big V, "Lanxi. "

It is worth noting that as a benchmark for the Central Radio and Television General Administration in the field of new media, "CCTV" has been broadcasting live the construction of two important hospitals in Mount Thor and Mount Vulcan since January 27("why 790,000 people watch the live broadcast of the hospital" at night) , arousing young people's cyber-watching and discussion, a window for bored and eager young Chinese stuck at home.

"people. "

In the "second opinion field" , public media such as Caixin, Sanlian life weekly and China Youth Daily maintain a strong influence on the overall public opinion by virtue of their editorial qualifications and front-line reporting, and the market-oriented media are also actively involved in the epidemic report, trying to cover the major epidemic for the socio-economic impact of more areas.

On the whole, "the second public opinion field" is characterized by more attention to the individual Chinese people in the disaster, placing people at the top of the attention sequence, with a clear humanitarian perspective. In this process, seize the opportunity to continue to insist on the rights and responsibilities of the epidemic and restore.

"CAIXIN" in "pneumonia diary | January 25: General Mobilization against the epidemic, how to solve the material difficulties? " Mentioned that after the "General Mobilization Order" was issued, whether the top-down coordination system could be effectively implemented to solve the problem of material allocation, it remains to be seen whether the epidemic can be contained.

The triad maximizes the use of its own discourse space, stretching the width of the perspective to work. On Jan. 27, in an article titled "The head of the Shanghai Medical Treatment Expert Group: Wuhan is very difficult, and other cities with imported cases will face greater challenges, " medical experts were interviewed to report positively on the epidemic at the same time, rethinking the disease control system.

A large quantity of COVID-19 was found in the south China Seafood Market in Wuhan, China, the CDC said Jan. 27. In the "exclusive | back to the start of pneumonia in Wuhan: Who owns the South China Market Selling Venison? " Published that evening, the China business daily refocused its attention on the almost forgotten south China seafood market.

This high-value investigative report casts off the moral condemnation of Venison trading and seeks to find the "rent-seeking" hotbed of the venison market. By tracing the political and commercial trajectory of the South China group behind the market, and its executives, Yu Zhusheng and Zhao Hong, the article points to the power relationships involved in wildlife sales, including on the game of the potential administrative licensing rules and ambiguous political and commercial relations.

According to the account in the article, the reporter went to the South China Group on January 1 and was stopped by local propaganda officials.

"Beiqingshen once" found the doctor who broke the news in late December that "seven cases of SARS were confirmed in the south China fruit and Seafood Market" , in the admonished Wuhan Doctor: 11 days after being infected by a patient and admitted to an isolation ward, the reader sees the life of the first doctor to issue a public health warning.

The doctor in Wuhan alerted a nearby school to the outbreak before the publication on January 28 of "freezing point weekly" , a magazine owned by the China Youth Daily. The subject of this article is Lu Xiaohong, director of the Department of gastroenterology at Wuhan's Fifth Hospital, using her sense of professional purpose, she sent a text message to the principal of a nearby high school, suggesting that high school seniors who had planned to make up for lost time take a leave of absence before the highest level of mobilization arrived on Jan. 20.

Because of the topic-setting ability and social credibility, another useful attempt of public media in special times is to become a participant in public affairs. In "WUHAN'S MEDICAL SUPPLIES DILEMMA: WHAT CAN WE DO? " , "Sanlian life weekly" announced that it would co-ordinate the donation information. Under the action topic, users of the Sanlian will be able to match resources.

Public Media and market media continue to tell the stories of the epidemic areas from a more holistic perspective, looking at ordinary people at the same time, and in these reports, we can see another narrative and a warm humanism about the epidemic, as well as the ordinary Wuhan people in the context of the crisis.

"people" on January 26 published "what are the doctors in Wuhan going through? " , different from the "Hubei Daily" model of Heroes, the article talked about doctors' trepidation when faced with a shortage of medical supplies and the possibility of infection, one of the details was that at two o'clock on New Year's Eve, a doctor did not sleep and sent the only message in the past six months that was not about his daughter's circle of friends. It was a request for material help.

Red Star News published "from leaving the city" to "terrorizing Hubei" on January 28, a cross-province drift of a Hubei a license plate car owner. It tells the story of a man who, after closing the han-leaving road in Wuhan, difficulties, difficulties and help for a wuhan-based car owner during a road trip in China. This article will take a look at five million ordinary people who left Wuhan during the Spring Festival.

Similar concerns were raised by the paper's January 28 publication, "the hotel heard I was from Wuhan and immediately called the police. ". These media reports revealed that as information checks were carried out in various places, some returnees from Wuhan found that their detailed personal information had spread on the Internet, many of them learned of the leak only after being harassed and reviled by strangers over the phone, on Wechat.

In fact, the complexity of the emotional landscape of social media has grown and continued to splinter during this time. In many things, the social media public noise has been divorced from the early "accountability" and "Popular Science" and so on, gradually separated from the "second public opinion field" , back to these years has been accustomed to stand, emotional rendering and "buttering" path. This is a very regrettable thing.

Especially with the news that the people of Wuhan have fled from Wuhan, some extreme Internet voices have targeted the people of Wuhan who have made great sacrifices. The issue of a dispute between a Shanghai born passenger and a Wuhan born passenger at Japan's Nagoya Airfield has generated a lot of extreme and selfish comments on Weibo, China's version of twitter.

In light of how grassroots people and organizations around the country have taken strong and one-size-fits-all isolation measures to protect themselves, compared to the Internet humor style and Internet celebrities' spreading characteristics mentioned in the previous article, the color of "other people's leadership" in this stage is weaker, led by some opinion leaders, there has been a correction of extreme emotions and unreasonable measures.

Such an environment of public opinion has also been criticized by various media. For example, "the Southern Metropolis Daily" pointed out in "containing the spread of the epidemic, we should also be alert to the stigma and discrimination against Wuhan and Hubei People. " "We should also prevent the leakage of privacy, the stigmatization of patients, discrimination against people in Wuhan and other secondary disasters. We should isolate the virus, not our fellow citizens. "

"People's Daily" publishes "Retransmission Appeal! ANTI-EPIDEMIC" can not become "fear of Hubei! " In attributing the spread of emotions to the spread of rumors, the public was urged: "In this war of resistance, the Hupeis are fellow countrymen and fellow-countrymen! Our only and common enemy is the virus! "

More Wuhan locals speak up on social media, calling for a rational view of the outbreak and the region. Up Master "Lin Chen" actually filmed the vlog in Wuhan, which began to spread in many communities such as Weibo and Hupu. In the video, he took to the streets of Wuhan, "everyone wants to do the right thing. She is still home to ten million people, " she said

On January 27th, a tragedy briefly interrupted the news of the death of Kobe Bryant, a famous American basketball player, in a plane crash, prompting memorials on Chinese social media, let the Chinese People's grief in a special season has multiple levels.

"We seem to be getting some kind of reminder of what I think of as the stable, indestructible life I have built, the sand castle of randomness, the Ashes to Ashes of the tide. "

There are also those who look for strength in the many layers of grief. "Kobe Bryant is the most extreme player in the history of basketball. There is no one like him: The most paranoid, the most tenacious, the most stubborn, the best strong-willed, the most diligent. He can play the most cunning (as long as he is willing) , but he is often the most stubborn. "

On the same night, people in Wuhan unconsciously but unanimously, through various social media contacts and initiations, arranged for a time to open their windows together, and high-powered "Go Wuhan, " Let the whole city's night echo with this cheer.

In an interview with Xinhua on Jan. 28, Zhong Nanshan said he did not expect a major increase, though he said the epidemic would peak in the next week or 10 days. At the end, he also talked about last night's "Wuhan refueling, " "the momentum came, many things can be resolved, the whole country to help, Wuhan is able to cross the border. "

Humans need humans.

Although some people care about the situation, some people care about "people" , but in the field of public opinion, we have begun to unite together.

By Zhang Youfa

The public opinion field in China during the anti-epidemic period continued to exhibit complexity, and in a more staring way.

After the release of great emotional pressure on New Year's Eve, from the next day (January 25) , the overall public opinion field tends to be stable and positive: the focus of the "first public opinion field" lies in the controllable overall situation, active epidemic prevention and the dedication of medical personnel, especially the positive changes that have taken place in Wuhan and Hubei; in the permitted discourse space, the focus of the public media in the "second public opinion field" lies in the concern for people, especially for the fate of individual characters in a crisis.

Objectively, "the first public opinion field" began to rise in power, to January 27, "the first public opinion field" discourse power and influence has been more fully played. "Unity and unity, unity and unity" has become the mainstream of public opinion in China. For "the second public opinion field" , after 4 days of brief activity, Sharp and noisy, it has to enter another phase. The space they have in the midst of this epidemic is also gradually being determined.

Social Media has returned to the context and expression it has become accustomed to, from regional attacks on Hubei and Wuhan in panic, to cyber-bullying in the name of refuting rumors, to campaigns for donations and epidemic prevention.

Although some people care about the situation, some people care about "people" , but in the field of public opinion, we have begun to unite together.

The public opinion field in China during the anti-epidemic period continued to exhibit complexity, and in a more staring way.

Objectively, "the first public opinion field" began to rise in power, to January 27, "the first public opinion field" discourse power and influence has been more fully played. "Unity and unity, unity and unity" has become the mainstream of public opinion in China. For "the second public opinion field" , after 4 days of brief activity, Sharp and noisy, it has to enter another phase. The space they have in the midst of this epidemic is also gradually being determined.

Social Media has returned to the context and expression it has become accustomed to, from regional attacks on Hubei and Wuhan in panic, to cyber-bullying in the name of refuting rumors, to campaigns for donations and epidemic prevention.

The big picture

Starting from January 25, in terms of leading actions, the official media began to send out positive signals to upgrade the prevention and control of the epidemic, and to pay more attention to the positive changes in the epidemic. In terms of controlling actions, the rumor governance mechanism has become more active and strict, and relevant social media platforms have also strengthened their censorship and punishment.

For example, on January 25, the WECHAT Security Center officially released a notice on the special treatment of rumors related to COVID-19 pneumonia on the same day, to dispel rumors by introducing professional third party rumor dispelling agencies, and depending on the extent of the violation of the account for stepped punishment, including but not limited to the account or account function for a limited period or permanent ban processing.

On January 27, Weibo also banned 35 accounts for name calling and cyber-bullying, including the active "Eagle of God" in the media arena over the past year.

On January 26, the relevant departments pointed out that "to promote the online formation of a strong positive energy, helping each other to fight the epidemic" , "for the prevention and control of the epidemic to create a good atmosphere on the Internet" became the meaning of the topic.

In today's media environment, the dissemination of special information is often associated with so-called "rumors" . Through the strict ban mechanism on new media constraints and discipline, to a certain extent, led to the "second field of public opinion" began to shrink in space.

At the same time, the discussion about the mechanism behind the rumor also stays more in the dissemination and the legal principle. On January 27, "thoughts on communication" published an old article, "rumors as a social protest, " which mentioned that rumors may also be an effort to reach an agreement on what is "true. ". If information is tightly controlled in a social order and the demand for news is greater than the supply of information through institutional channels, rumours will proliferate.

On January 28th the Supreme People's Court published an article saying that law enforcement agencies should give full play to the subjective evil formation and cognitive ability of information publishers and disseminators in the face of false information. As long as the information is basically true, the publisher and disseminator have no malicious intention, and the behavior objectively does not cause serious harm, we should maintain a tolerant attitude to such "false information" .

The sensationalist retweets in the "Forum 1" , such as the 1.4 billion flag Flag of the People's Republic of China during the Hong Kong incident, did not cause much of a stir this time. What can really spread is information about the epidemic, such as the People's Daily's "urgent search for people! These trains and flights have new-type pneumonia patients" .

In the face of a changing epidemic, the public demand for information far exceeds the choice of position and mood.

The state media are also deliberately increasing the amount of information they can export to the general public and their centralisation. For example, the vaccine is being developed! Xinhua news agency posted on Wechat on Jan. 26! Here are 30 good things to know, and the Jan. 27 issue of together against the plague! These news asks you to pay attention to", January 28 issue"FIGHT EPIDEMIC SITUATION!"! Follow these 20 messages.

At the same time, such media began to expand the focus of the disaster area, gradually attention and influence the previous propaganda blind spot. It must be pointed out that the "second public opinion field" has been on the call. For example, People's Daily published "parents, obey! Prevent new type pneumonia, please listen to six words of advice" and "Urgent Appeal! Prevent and control the epidemic, don't leave out the countryside! " On the 25th and 26th, the target of attention and mobilization is the middle-aged and the elderly and the rural population.

CCTV also stepped up its coverage of the outbreak after Jan. 25. At 9:30 pm on the 26th, the CCTV-13 broadcast a special program titled "War Epidemic" , which mainly covered the official announcement of the epidemic and the situation report on the front line. At this time, in the entertainment channel broadcast, the bottom also appears the epidemic health alert scrolling information. The News investigation, which played a major role in the fight against SARS 17 years ago, was announced on January 26 by its program team to go to Wuhan.

On January 28, the Publicity Department of the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) coordinated the programming of national satellite television every day to guide the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control reporting, the reduction of entertainment programming, and the timely issuance of guidelines for all-day programming by 36 satellite television stations. In addition to Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Anhui, Chongqing and other provincial-level satellite TV has launched the fight against the epidemic news live broadcast programs and special reports, timely release of authoritative information.

The density of government press conferences has also increased. At a press conference held on the afternoon of January 26, the director of the health commission, Ma Xiaowei, admitted that the current virus has become more transmissible and the epidemic situation is serious and complex. Political commentator Blogger "chairman rabbit" praised the event on Weibo, saying: "The event did a good job. It's a lot of information. "

Experts with prestige and trust in the hearts of the people have also set up micro-blogs, or appeared in interviews with the media, will be rational in line with the requirements of order to pass out the voice, to calm the people's mood and strengthen the will of the people.

However, a failed press conference can, to a large extent, trigger a backlash against public opinion, undermining the "first public opinion field" efforts to build consistency. On the evening of January 26, the performance of three local officials in Hubei who played an important role in the outbreak at a press conference triggered a huge public opinion backlash again.

Blocking and filtering major news comment areas has always been an effective way for officials to guard against the extremes of speech, but at the time of this news release, figures and opinions that might otherwise have been blocked by convention also appeared in the comment section, the comment section of the mainstream media was opened up to the disaffected public.

On the night of January 27th, the Mayor of Wuhan admitted in a CCTV interview that the information had not been released in time and offered his own explanation. For the first time, the embattled official has spoken publicly about putting his political future ahead of the broader need to fight the epidemic. But this seemingly selfless and fearless statement is not understood by the general public.

In the public opinion demand of promoting positive energy in the fight against the epidemic, some local media rely on the mode of "sacrificing the little to become the big" , which is not only difficult to have a positive incentive effect on the people, instead, he was accused of being "cold-blooded and heartless" .

For example, an article in the Hubei Daily entitled "Recall! Medical workers in Yichang Walk 70 miles back to hospital" was widely criticized. "Recalling medical personnel but not arranging vehicles, and allowing people to walk 35 kilometers to the hospital, are quite proud of this kind of propaganda. This is the style of propaganda in Hubei Province, " commented Weibo's big V, "Lanxi. "

It is worth noting that as a benchmark for the Central Radio and Television General Administration in the field of new media, "CCTV" has been broadcasting live the construction of two important hospitals in Mount Thor and Mount Vulcan since January 27("why 790,000 people watch the live broadcast of the hospital" at night) , arousing young people's cyber-watching and discussion, a window for bored and eager young Chinese stuck at home.

Starting from January 25, in terms of leading actions, the official media began to send out positive signals to upgrade the prevention and control of the epidemic, and to pay more attention to the positive changes in the epidemic. In terms of controlling actions, the rumor governance mechanism has become more active and strict, and relevant social media platforms have also strengthened their censorship and punishment.

For example, on January 25, the WECHAT Security Center officially released a notice on the special treatment of rumors related to COVID-19 pneumonia on the same day, to dispel rumors by introducing professional third party rumor dispelling agencies, and depending on the extent of the violation of the account for stepped punishment, including but not limited to the account or account function for a limited period or permanent ban processing.

On January 27, Weibo also banned 35 accounts for name calling and cyber-bullying, including the active "Eagle of God" in the media arena over the past year.

On January 26, the relevant departments pointed out that "to promote the online formation of a strong positive energy, helping each other to fight the epidemic" , "for the prevention and control of the epidemic to create a good atmosphere on the Internet" became the meaning of the topic.

In today's media environment, the dissemination of special information is often associated with so-called "rumors" . Through the strict ban mechanism on new media constraints and discipline, to a certain extent, led to the "second field of public opinion" began to shrink in space.

At the same time, the discussion about the mechanism behind the rumor also stays more in the dissemination and the legal principle. On January 27, "thoughts on communication" published an old article, "rumors as a social protest, " which mentioned that rumors may also be an effort to reach an agreement on what is "true. ". If information is tightly controlled in a social order and the demand for news is greater than the supply of information through institutional channels, rumours will proliferate.

On January 28th the Supreme People's Court published an article saying that law enforcement agencies should give full play to the subjective evil formation and cognitive ability of information publishers and disseminators in the face of false information. As long as the information is basically true, the publisher and disseminator have no malicious intention, and the behavior objectively does not cause serious harm, we should maintain a tolerant attitude to such "false information" .

The sensationalist retweets in the "Forum 1" , such as the 1.4 billion flag Flag of the People's Republic of China during the Hong Kong incident, did not cause much of a stir this time. What can really spread is information about the epidemic, such as the People's Daily's "urgent search for people! These trains and flights have new-type pneumonia patients" .

In the face of a changing epidemic, the public demand for information far exceeds the choice of position and mood.

The state media are also deliberately increasing the amount of information they can export to the general public and their centralisation. For example, the vaccine is being developed! Xinhua news agency posted on Wechat on Jan. 26! Here are 30 good things to know, and the Jan. 27 issue of together against the plague! These news asks you to pay attention to", January 28 issue"FIGHT EPIDEMIC SITUATION!"! Follow these 20 messages.

At the same time, such media began to expand the focus of the disaster area, gradually attention and influence the previous propaganda blind spot. It must be pointed out that the "second public opinion field" has been on the call. For example, People's Daily published "parents, obey! Prevent new type pneumonia, please listen to six words of advice" and "Urgent Appeal! Prevent and control the epidemic, don't leave out the countryside! " On the 25th and 26th, the target of attention and mobilization is the middle-aged and the elderly and the rural population.

CCTV also stepped up its coverage of the outbreak after Jan. 25. At 9:30 pm on the 26th, the CCTV-13 broadcast a special program titled "War Epidemic" , which mainly covered the official announcement of the epidemic and the situation report on the front line. At this time, in the entertainment channel broadcast, the bottom also appears the epidemic health alert scrolling information. The News investigation, which played a major role in the fight against SARS 17 years ago, was announced on January 26 by its program team to go to Wuhan.

On January 28, the Publicity Department of the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) coordinated the programming of national satellite television every day to guide the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control reporting, the reduction of entertainment programming, and the timely issuance of guidelines for all-day programming by 36 satellite television stations. In addition to Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Anhui, Chongqing and other provincial-level satellite TV has launched the fight against the epidemic news live broadcast programs and special reports, timely release of authoritative information.

The density of government press conferences has also increased. At a press conference held on the afternoon of January 26, the director of the health commission, Ma Xiaowei, admitted that the current virus has become more transmissible and the epidemic situation is serious and complex. Political commentator Blogger "chairman rabbit" praised the event on Weibo, saying: "The event did a good job. It's a lot of information. "

Experts with prestige and trust in the hearts of the people have also set up micro-blogs, or appeared in interviews with the media, will be rational in line with the requirements of order to pass out the voice, to calm the people's mood and strengthen the will of the people.

However, a failed press conference can, to a large extent, trigger a backlash against public opinion, undermining the "first public opinion field" efforts to build consistency.

"people. "

In the "second opinion field" , public media such as Caixin, Sanlian life weekly and China Youth Daily maintain a strong influence on the overall public opinion by virtue of their editorial qualifications and front-line reporting, and the market-oriented media are also actively involved in the epidemic report, trying to cover the major epidemic for the socio-economic impact of more areas.

On the whole, "the second public opinion field" is characterized by more attention to the individual Chinese people in the disaster, placing people at the top of the attention sequence, with a clear humanitarian perspective. In this process, seize the opportunity to continue to insist on the rights and responsibilities of the epidemic and restore.

"CAIXIN" in "pneumonia diary | January 25: General Mobilization against the epidemic, how to solve the material difficulties? " Mentioned that after the "General Mobilization Order" was issued, whether the top-down coordination system could be effectively implemented to solve the problem of material allocation, it remains to be seen whether the epidemic can be contained.

The triad maximizes the use of its own discourse space, stretching the width of the perspective to work. On Jan. 27, in an article titled "The head of the Shanghai Medical Treatment Expert Group: Wuhan is very difficult, and other cities with imported cases will face greater challenges, " medical experts were interviewed to report positively on the epidemic at the same time, rethinking the disease control system.

A large quantity of COVID-19 was found in the south China Seafood Market in Wuhan, China, the CDC said Jan. 27. In the "exclusive | back to the start of pneumonia in Wuhan: Who owns the South China Market Selling Venison? " Published that evening, the China business daily refocused its attention on the almost forgotten south China seafood market.

This high-value investigative report casts off the moral condemnation of Venison trading and seeks to find the "rent-seeking" hotbed of the venison market. By tracing the political and commercial trajectory of the South China group behind the market, and its executives, Yu Zhusheng and Zhao Hong, the article points to the power relationships involved in wildlife sales, including on the game of the potential administrative licensing rules and ambiguous political and commercial relations.

According to the account in the article, the reporter went to the South China Group on January 1 and was stopped by local propaganda officials.

"Beiqingshen once" found the doctor who broke the news in late December that "seven cases of SARS were confirmed in the south China fruit and Seafood Market" , in the admonished Wuhan Doctor: 11 days after being infected by a patient and admitted to an isolation ward, the reader sees the life of the first doctor to issue a public health warning.

The doctor in Wuhan alerted a nearby school to the outbreak before the publication on January 28 of "freezing point weekly" , a magazine owned by the China Youth Daily. The subject of this article is Lu Xiaohong, director of the Department of gastroenterology at Wuhan's Fifth Hospital, using her sense of professional purpose, she sent a text message to the principal of a nearby high school, suggesting that high school seniors who had planned to make up for lost time take a leave of absence before the highest level of mobilization arrived on Jan. 20.

Because of the topic-setting ability and social credibility, another useful attempt of public media in special times is to become a participant in public affairs. In "WUHAN'S MEDICAL SUPPLIES DILEMMA: WHAT CAN WE DO? " , "Sanlian life weekly" announced that it would co-ordinate the donation information. Under the action topic, users of the Sanlian will be able to match resources.

Public Media and market media continue to tell the stories of the epidemic areas from a more holistic perspective, looking at ordinary people at the same time, and in these reports, we can see another narrative and a warm humanism about the epidemic, as well as the ordinary Wuhan people in the context of the crisis.

"people" on January 26 published "what are the doctors in Wuhan going through? " , different from the "Hubei Daily" model of Heroes, the article talked about doctors' trepidation when faced with a shortage of medical supplies and the possibility of infection, one of the details was that at two o'clock on New Year's Eve, a doctor did not sleep and sent the only message in the past six months that was not about his daughter's circle of friends. It was a request for material help.

Red Star News published "from leaving the city" to "terrorizing Hubei" on January 28, a cross-province drift of a Hubei a license plate car owner. It tells the story of a man who, after closing the han-leaving road in Wuhan, difficulties, difficulties and help for a wuhan-based car owner during a road trip in China. This article will take a look at five million ordinary people who left Wuhan during the Spring Festival.

Similar concerns were raised by the paper's January 28 publication, "the hotel heard I was from Wuhan and immediately called the police. ". These media reports revealed that as information checks were carried out in various places, some returnees from Wuhan found that their detailed personal information had spread on the Internet, many of them learned of the leak only after being harassed and reviled by strangers over the phone, on Wechat.

In fact, the complexity of the emotional landscape of social media has grown and continued to splinter during this time. In many things, the social media public noise has been divorced from the early "accountability" and "Popular Science" and so on, gradually separated from the "second public opinion field" , back to these years has been accustomed to stand, emotional rendering and "buttering" path. This is a very regrettable thing.

Especially with the news that the people of Wuhan have fled from Wuhan, some extreme Internet voices have targeted the people of Wuhan who have made great sacrifices. The issue of a dispute between a Shanghai born passenger and a Wuhan born passenger at Japan's Nagoya Airfield has generated a lot of extreme and selfish comments on Weibo, China's version of twitter.

In light of how grassroots people and organizations around the country have taken strong and one-size-fits-all isolation measures to protect themselves, compared to the Internet humor style and Internet celebrities' spreading characteristics mentioned in the previous article, the color of "other people's leadership" in this stage is weaker, led by some opinion leaders, there has been a correction of extreme emotions and unreasonable measures.

Such an environment of public opinion has also been criticized by various media. For example, "the Southern Metropolis Daily" pointed out in "containing the spread of the epidemic, we should also be alert to the stigma and discrimination against Wuhan and Hubei People. " "We should also prevent the leakage of privacy, the stigmatization of patients, discrimination against people in Wuhan and other secondary disasters. We should isolate the virus, not our fellow citizens. "

"People's Daily" publishes "Retransmission Appeal! ANTI-EPIDEMIC" can not become "fear of Hubei! " In attributing the spread of emotions to the spread of rumors, the public was urged: "In this war of resistance, the Hupeis are fellow countrymen and fellow-countrymen! Our only and common enemy is the virus! "

More Wuhan locals speak up on social media, calling for a rational view of the outbreak and the region. Up Master "Lin Chen" actually filmed the vlog in Wuhan, which began to spread in many communities such as Weibo and Hupu. In the video, he took to the streets of Wuhan, "everyone wants to do the right thing. She is still home to ten million people, " she said

On January 27th, a tragedy briefly interrupted the news of the death of Kobe Bryant, a famous American basketball player, in a plane crash, prompting memorials on Chinese social media, let the Chinese People's grief in a special season has multiple levels.

"We seem to be getting some kind of reminder of what I think of as the stable, indestructible life I have built, the sand castle of randomness, the Ashes to Ashes of the tide. "

There are also those who look for strength in the many layers of grief. "Kobe Bryant is the most extreme player in the history of basketball. There is no one like him: The most paranoid, the most tenacious, the most stubborn, the best strong-willed, the most diligent. He can play the most cunning (as long as he is willing) , but he is often the most stubborn. "

On the same night, people in Wuhan unconsciously but unanimously, through various social media contacts and initiations, arranged for a time to open their windows together, and high-powered "Go Wuhan, " Let the whole city's night echo with this cheer.

In an interview with Xinhua on Jan. 28, Zhong Nanshan said he did not expect a major increase, though he said the epidemic would peak in the next week or 10 days. At the end, he also talked about last night's "Wuhan refueling, " "the momentum came, many things can be resolved, the whole country to help, Wuhan is able to cross the border. "
