"Pay Your employees a million dollars out of your own pocket. "
Home-stay Entrepreneur Xie Qiang

We have 3 bed and breakfast in Guangdong, 20 rooms, the original January 15 or so booked up, from the 12th month twenty-eight to the 6th day of the New Year is almost full room. After Academician Zhong Nanshan's announcement on January 20, I was a little worried, and many of my customers were also worried and called to ask.

At first, most of them said they'd like to reschedule, come back later, and of course, we'll change them unconditionally. Wait until the latter more and more serious epidemic, especially January 23 after Wuhan to close the city, the next day is the Lunar New Year 30, into a large-scale refund, everyone is busy negotiating, docking.

In previous years, the Spring Festival guests especially, the kitchen from 6 am to prepare breakfast, the evening may also have barbecue, party, a shop 10 people busy around. It's been a special year, and even without guests, we've been busier.

Two or three days had gone by too quickly for immediate reaction. On January 21st, we had all the supplies, we ran out of freezers, and we got a new one. A local Lantern Festival was set to open on January 22, but it took only two hours to close. The flowers were not sold, and it was sad to see vendors smashing piles of flowers.

Flowers can not be sold, and not easily stored, vendors had to smash the flowers. Photo / interviewees

It's still full on January 20th, and it's been practically empty since January 23rd. Compulsory closure of the province, can not privately receive Hubei guests, only by the government designated places to receive. One of the Shenzhen guests, who had arrived early with his parents, was a native of Hubei Province, but had been living in Shenzhen. The health department checked him out, made sure he was okay, and then they let him stay. Who knows the government announcement on the first day of the year, as long as it is Hubei resident customers, are not allowed to leave again, on-site isolation for 14 days. Notice came in at 12:00. The guest checked out at 2:00.

It's a pretty big loss right now. Maybe a couple of three million. We originally rely on the Spring Festival, summer vacation and national day income, now equivalent to the entire Spring Festival income is zero.

The bulk of the previous stock, such as the purchase of 100 pieces of fresh milk, with a 10-day expiration date, now requires staff to toast with milk at New Year's Eve dinners. 300 chickens and ducks, all for the staff.

Wages are an even bigger headache. Wages will be paid on the 10th of each month. I told the staff that wages will be paid in January, and living expenses may be paid in February according to the local minimum wage in Guangdong. This is also a guideline issued by the Guangdong Provincial People's Social Department, that comes to $1,500-$2,100. But in the past Spring Festival, including overtime, three times the salary, cleaning post aunt have more than 5000 yuan.

February 1 I intend to implement the first half of the half-month half of the model, a store originally 10 people, only 5 people to stay on rotation, the minimum cost to maintain, think once can restore, but also immediately to normal business. We can't afford to downsize right now. It's GONNA cost us a lot of money.

Three months in the short term, it'll hold, but if it lasts six months or even a year, it's bad. My limit is $1 million in my own pocket, maybe three, four months.

Year twenty-nine, 30 and the first day of the Lunar New Year were the highest returns. Spring Festival gala, I do not have the heart to see, a pile of blessing text messages come over, happy New Year, not happy at all, I did not return, really do not have the heart, just want to return how much?

New Year's Eve has been in communication and coordination, some guests asked for immediate refund to the account, but the money is in the channel there, holidays and can not be transferred out, there are also people who said to complain, call the Mayor Hotline, 315 and so on. There will be a call from the relevant departments, the attitude from the beginning of the strong, said you must return, give a plan, slowly become understanding us, it is too much refund, back said try to communicate, negotiate well.

I shut myself up in my room all night to make phone calls, and didn't tell my wife and kids what was going on. They were young and didn't want to upset them. It was 1:00 in the morning, and then I watched a movie, lost in translation, and then I got tired and went to bed at 3:00.

It's not the first time we've started a business, and even though it's rare, it's not going to knock us out of the park, just like the stock market, you can't go all the way down to a crash and then it's going to go up. These two days there are also some old customers said, really can not stand, at home to be sick, I joke with him, you are sure to come? You come in for a physical, you file a report, I might have to take the rap. He said it was all right, and I said the cooks had gone home, and he said it would be nice to be able to cook a bowl of noodles.

People get choked up, there might be some retaliatory spending. I tease him, you come to the garden of vegetables but do not rob, pick a box, take away.

Thank you for the lively scene at the bed-and-breakfast. Photo / interviewees

"Tens of thousands of Inns shut down. "
The owner of Lijiang Inn, Xuan Xuan Xuan

In Lijiang Su River Town Open Inn 4 years, Spring Festival is the best business time, a total of 12 rooms, belong to you have money, I have no room. On the 22nd, we checked out about 20 rooms, but Hubei guests on the other side had nowhere to stay, and some stayed overnight at KFC. I was asked by my partner if we would take any clients from Hubei who were stranded in Lijiang? I said answer it. I'm from Yichang. My partner is from Wuhan. After the information was posted to the platform, nine hundred calls were received on Lunar New Year's Eve and the first and second days of the Lunar New Year. There are in Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, they want to come back, but can not enter Wuhan.

Lijiang is January 25, that is, the New Year's Day under the order, closed, equivalent to all the INN closed, no customers, we can only send back all the late orders. Unable to receive Hubei People, we organized a group, and the government together to negotiate, set up the hotel.

Work a circle, account up how is a loss. These two months, at least 100,000 or so, 3,000 yuan labor, 3,000 yuan water and electricity, 250,000 a year rent, and so on, in previous years this period can make 400,000, or very profitable. There are more than 10,000 inns in Lijiang, which is a large sum in aggregate, but a loss of $100,000 per establishment would be roughly $1bn.

Setting up a hotel looks like it has guests, but it's also a loss. The cheapest room they had was $900, which the government and we ground every day, from $900 to $700, from $700 to $400, and another $100 last night. It wasn't easy for them either.

Perhaps because of the difficulty of meeting the three roles of guest, hotel and government, I took my losses a little more lightly. That day in the resettlement hotel to see the left-behind front-line cadres, close contact with people every day, only a single-layer mask. But they work arrangement is very good, Hubei fellow-townsman every day eats the fruit to be unable to finish, each kind of solicitude.

This year I did not go home for the New Year, my father yesterday still asked, this year did not earn money, enough to buy supplies? He's worried about me. Now there's almost no one on Lijiang Street, the neighbor goes home, leaves four dogs, and we have a dog that feeds and sleeps every day. Sometimes he organized the innkeepers to make dumplings and stewed chicken feet. Yesterday we sent stewed chicken feet to one of the settlements. Today we helped deliver face masks and flower cakes. This time of year in the past from morning to night, send the machine, arrange to check in, when the guide, Dizzy, now do these things, the heart is very quiet.

Usually a year to earn 300,000 no problem, who do not want to lose money inside, this year the environment is not good, indifferent mentality, do not force. I'm ready to go a year without making any money, as long as I can keep my capital.

"Many of our peers have reached the end of their lives. "
Travel Platform CEO sail

In the middle of January, a doctor friend told me that Wuhan was not doing well, but I didn't think it had anything to do with Guangdong. It was only a matter of days, from a lack of information, to a sudden outbreak of information, to a very aggressive response to the epidemic.

Tourism is the most vulnerable sector of the epidemic. In the past, the Spring Festival was the peak season, which lasted until the 15th day of the first lunar month. Compared with the usual price increases of 10% ~ 20% , our room is usually more than 800 a room, which may increase by 100 yuan. But on New Year's Eve, almost all of them were canceled. In a province where policies vary, such as Qingyuan in Guangdong, which has ordered tourist attractions and hotels to close, there are some bed and breakfasts in Huizhou, because tourism is a pillar industry in Huizhou, which simply says it should be closed.

In fact, the reality also had to close, someone put the car into the village road blocked, guests can not enter, business can not, simply stopped. B & B, Hotel owners also do not want to take risks, resulting in tension with the local government and residents, may not be able to sustain future business.

None of my peers have New Year's Eve. One group went to Jiuzhaigou Valley on the first day of the Lunar New Year. The scenic spot was closed at 11:00 pm on the 30th of the Lunar New Year. The tourists could only get a full refund. However, the profit of the travel agency of several hundred yuan per person was completely wiped out. And that's just one Jiuzhaigou Valley, where most of the country's attractions have been closed for the past few days. What I feel when I see my colleagues talking about it is that I want to cry, I really want to cry.

Many more are busy trying to get refunds from foreign travel agencies. A group of more than 40 Chinese tourists from Dubai were unable to enter the country due to the outbreak. Dubai offers two options, one is to give a breakdown of the damage, discuss with guests, accept the rest of the money back, and wait until the end of the epidemic, within a year, guests take the same trip without increase in price, can also be transferred. This gives me a lot of inspiration to deal with the current platform UNSUBSCRIBE.

Speaking of, can deal with a refund, is the test hotel, bed and breakfast, travel agencies the key to life and death. At first, when it wasn't so bad, our company tried to talk people out of it. The best solution is to change the date for free. Most of the guests are from Guangdong Province. There are many familiar customers and opportunities to consume these resources.

Shock defences have a big impact on the whole tourism industry. Tourism is a very comprehensive industry, eat, live, travel, travel, shopping, entertainment are involved in a very long chain. Occupancy rates have been less than ideal since November last year, when the Chinese New Year was supposed to be about making money. Cut It all off. Can't handle it. I'm afraid a lot of people are gonNA lose their jobs. But I am optimistic that this May Day, if the epidemic can be ended early, a core engine to boost domestic demand or tourism.

"A hole this big, cash flow is important. "
CEO  

The importance of corporate cash flow is evident in this outbreak, especially in our industry.

Our company is mainly engaged in air ticket purchasing. To do this business, first of all, you need to have the qualification of the IATA, and third-party guarantee for the reservation. After the ticket, according to twice a week to pay the Air Association.

Charter flights are a very lucrative business. Charter flights to Europe, for example, one time to put in two million, and we have a large volume of business, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars into it is normal. I calculate this time, the security deposit is nearly 100 million, plus the money paid to the airlines, out of nearly 200 million yuan.

After the outbreak of the disease, the cultural and tourism departments announced that they would stop their business. On January 24, they issued a letter saying that new tours would not be accepted from the 27th onwards. Before the 27th, the tours could travel normally. From the 27th until the end of March, they may have to be cancelled, that's like a whole quarter of earnings hit. Money back to customers, and no new business came in, the monthly cost of staff salaries 10 million, plus rent, taxes together about 15 million, a quarterly loss of 45 million yuan.

With such a big hole, cash flow is important.

Last year, we had fairly adequate fund reserve, and there were about 100 million yuan in our account. Since the start-up shareholders have not paid dividends, in addition, just before the recovery of a commission, nearly 100 million yuan, roughly calculate, can last half a year.

The New Year these days the company also did not idle, usually according to the normal refund proportion of staff arrangements, about 10 people responsible for the line. As soon as the refunds started coming in, the only people who could get them were company wide refunds, and thirty people were on call 24 hours a day.

All of a sudden, you're staring at three words on a computer —— waiting to be processed, and then calmly explaining them to a client.

The most difficult to change is overseas business, domestic non-return change policy, airlines will return to us, but like the United States, Europe, there is no outbreak of local, will not understand free change. For example, if a customer flies from Beijing to San Francisco, the ticket may be refundable for free, but if the flight is booked locally in the United States, the source will not refundable, which accounts for 20 percent of the business.

I've been worried about the chain, and we're all in this together. Upriver is the account for the client's January 20th trip, it's gone, and the money hasn't come back to us yet. Downstream is the airline refund, it is difficult to ensure that all airlines have sufficient cash flow. In the event of a systemic meltdown, we could lose nearly $200 million in deposits and airline tickets.

Affected by the epidemic, a large number of flights have been cancelled in recent days. Image / network

These days can be very trance, lost, has been thinking about how to face the next thing. For example, can we get some support from the government, such as loans, rent, taxes. I even thought what if the tourism industry shut down for a year, should we do something else?

We were talking about salary on the conference call yesterday. I didn't expect to be paid minimum wage, a team of 700 people, many with families, mortgages, car loans. And there's no way an employee can get a job while they're gone.

Recently there is a city policy, let us be very sensitive, that there are minors in the family can be a person at home to take care of children, business owners to pay the normal wage. In my opinion, this cost of the blame is to let business owners, now the most afraid of policy is to add negative, not exemption. I'm scared. I won't last six months.

Sometimes I think the worst-case scenario is to optimize the staff and leave a skeleton staff. Otherwise, start a new business.

This Spring Festival, the Group of employees are not how to send red envelopes, before will send one hundred thousand, this year is to congratulate or not to congratulate, anyway, embarrassed, can only give everyone morale.

Good thing I'm a man of positive expectations. I have carefully studied the industry during the SARS period, 2003 was a trough, to 2004 blowout, some companies also catch the wind. During the SARS period, the state will implement the tax exemption and other policies for some industries. I always think it's important to work on your inner strength, and use that time to catch up on things I didn't think of before. For example, staff quality skills training, years ago did not have time to do. February 9th. Let's start with that.

For example, if a customer flies from Beijing to San Francisco, the ticket may be refundable for free, but if the flight is booked locally in the United States, the source will not refundable, which accounts for 20 percent of the business.

I've been worried about the chain, and we're all in this together. Upriver is the account for the client's January 20th trip, it's gone, and the money hasn't come back to us yet. Downstream is the airline refund, it is difficult to ensure that all airlines have sufficient cash flow. In the event of a systemic meltdown, we could lose nearly $200 million in deposits and airline tickets.

Affected by the epidemic, a large number of flights have been cancelled in recent days. Image / network

These days can be very trance, lost, has been thinking about how to face the next thing. For example, can we get some support from the government, such as loans, rent, taxes. I even thought what if the tourism industry shut down for a year, should we do something else?

We were talking about salary on the conference call yesterday. I didn't expect to be paid minimum wage, a team of 700 people, many with families, mortgages, car loans. And there's no way an employee can get a job while they're gone.

Recently there is a city policy, let us be very sensitive, that there are minors in the family can be a person at home to take care of children, business owners to pay the normal wage. In my opinion, this cost of the blame is to let business owners, now the most afraid of policy is to add negative, not exemption. I'm scared. I won't last six months.

Sometimes I think the worst-case scenario is to optimize the staff and leave a skeleton staff. Otherwise, start a new business.

This Spring Festival, the Group of employees are not how to send red envelopes, before will send one hundred thousand, this year is to congratulate or not to congratulate, anyway, embarrassed, can only give everyone morale.

Good thing I'm a man of positive expectations. I have carefully studied the industry during the SARS period, 2003 was a trough, to 2004 blowout, some companies also catch the wind. During the SARS period, the state will implement the tax exemption and other policies for some industries. I always think it's important to work on your inner strength, and use that time to catch up on things I didn't think of before. For example, staff quality skills training, years ago did not have time to do. February 9th. Let's start with that.

"Pay Your employees a million dollars out of your own pocket. "

Home-stay Entrepreneur Xie Qiang

We have 3 bed and breakfast in Guangdong, 20 rooms, the original January 15 or so booked up, from the 12th month twenty-eight to the 6th day of the New Year is almost full room. After Academician Zhong Nanshan's announcement on January 20, I was a little worried, and many of my customers were also worried and called to ask.

At first, most of them said they'd like to reschedule, come back later, and of course, we'll change them unconditionally. Wait until the latter more and more serious epidemic, especially January 23 after Wuhan to close the city, the next day is the Lunar New Year 30, into a large-scale refund, everyone is busy negotiating, docking.

In previous years, the Spring Festival guests especially, the kitchen from 6 am to prepare breakfast, the evening may also have barbecue, party, a shop 10 people busy around. It's been a special year, and even without guests, we've been busier.

Two or three days had gone by too quickly for immediate reaction. On January 21st, we had all the supplies, we ran out of freezers, and we got a new one. A local Lantern Festival was set to open on January 22, but it took only two hours to close. The flowers were not sold, and it was sad to see vendors smashing piles of flowers.

Flowers can not be sold, and not easily stored, vendors had to smash the flowers. Photo / interviewees

It's still full on January 20th, and it's been practically empty since January 23rd. Compulsory closure of the province, can not privately receive Hubei guests, only by the government designated places to receive. One of the Shenzhen guests, who had arrived early with his parents, was a native of Hubei Province, but had been living in Shenzhen. The health department checked him out, made sure he was okay, and then they let him stay. Who knows the government announcement on the first day of the year, as long as it is Hubei resident customers, are not allowed to leave again, on-site isolation for 14 days. Notice came in at 12:00. The guest checked out at 2:00.

It's a pretty big loss right now. Maybe a couple of three million. We originally rely on the Spring Festival, summer vacation and national day income, now equivalent to the entire Spring Festival income is zero.

The bulk of the previous stock, such as the purchase of 100 pieces of fresh milk, with a 10-day expiration date, now requires staff to toast with milk at New Year's Eve dinners. 300 chickens and ducks, all for the staff.

Wages are an even bigger headache. Wages will be paid on the 10th of each month. I told the staff that wages will be paid in January, and living expenses may be paid in February according to the local minimum wage in Guangdong. This is also a guideline issued by the Guangdong Provincial People's Social Department, that comes to $1,500-$2,100. But in the past Spring Festival, including overtime, three times the salary, cleaning post aunt have more than 5000 yuan.

February 1 I intend to implement the first half of the half-month half of the model, a store originally 10 people, only 5 people to stay on rotation, the minimum cost to maintain, think once can restore, but also immediately to normal business. We can't afford to downsize right now. It's GONNA cost us a lot of money.

Three months in the short term, it'll hold, but if it lasts six months or even a year, it's bad. My limit is $1 million in my own pocket, maybe three, four months.

Year twenty-nine, 30 and the first day of the Lunar New Year were the highest returns. Spring Festival gala, I do not have the heart to see, a pile of blessing text messages come over, happy New Year, not happy at all, I did not return, really do not have the heart, just want to return how much?

New Year's Eve has been in communication and coordination, some guests asked for immediate refund to the account, but the money is in the channel there, holidays and can not be transferred out, there are also people who said to complain, call the Mayor Hotline, 315 and so on. There will be a call from the relevant departments, the attitude from the beginning of the strong, said you must return, give a plan, slowly become understanding us, it is too much refund, back said try to communicate, negotiate well.

I shut myself up in my room all night to make phone calls, and didn't tell my wife and kids what was going on. They were young and didn't want to upset them. It was 1:00 in the morning, and then I watched a movie, lost in translation, and then I got tired and went to bed at 3:00.

It's not the first time we've started a business, and even though it's rare, it's not going to knock us out of the park, just like the stock market, you can't go all the way down to a crash and then it's going to go up. These two days there are also some old customers said, really can not stand, at home to be sick, I joke with him, you are sure to come? You come in for a physical, you file a report, I might have to take the rap. He said it was all right, and I said the cooks had gone home, and he said it would be nice to be able to cook a bowl of noodles.

People get choked up, there might be some retaliatory spending. I tease him, you come to the garden of vegetables but do not rob, pick a box, take away.

Thank you for the lively scene at the bed-and-breakfast. Photo / interviewees

"Tens of thousands of Inns shut down. "

The owner of Lijiang Inn, Xuan Xuan Xuan

In Lijiang Su River Town Open Inn 4 years, Spring Festival is the best business time, a total of 12 rooms, belong to you have money, I have no room. On the 22nd, we checked out about 20 rooms, but Hubei guests on the other side had nowhere to stay, and some stayed overnight at KFC. I was asked by my partner if we would take any clients from Hubei who were stranded in Lijiang? I said answer it. I'm from Yichang. My partner is from Wuhan. After the information was posted to the platform, nine hundred calls were received on Lunar New Year's Eve and the first and second days of the Lunar New Year. There are in Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, they want to come back, but can not enter Wuhan.

Lijiang is January 25, that is, the New Year's Day under the order, closed, equivalent to all the INN closed, no customers, we can only send back all the late orders. Unable to receive Hubei People, we organized a group, and the government together to negotiate, set up the hotel.

Work a circle, account up how is a loss. These two months, at least 100,000 or so, 3,000 yuan labor, 3,000 yuan water and electricity, 250,000 a year rent, and so on, in previous years this period can make 400,000, or very profitable. There are more than 10,000 inns in Lijiang, which is a large sum in aggregate, but a loss of $100,000 per establishment would be roughly $1bn.

Setting up a hotel looks like it has guests, but it's also a loss. The cheapest room they had was $900, which the government and we ground every day, from $900 to $700, from $700 to $400, and another $100 last night. It wasn't easy for them either.

Perhaps because of the difficulty of meeting the three roles of guest, hotel and government, I took my losses a little more lightly. That day in the resettlement hotel to see the left-behind front-line cadres, close contact with people every day, only a single-layer mask. But they work arrangement is very good, Hubei fellow-townsman every day eats the fruit to be unable to finish, each kind of solicitude.

This year I did not go home for the New Year, my father yesterday still asked, this year did not earn money, enough to buy supplies? He's worried about me. Now there's almost no one on Lijiang Street, the neighbor goes home, leaves four dogs, and we have a dog that feeds and sleeps every day. Sometimes he organized the innkeepers to make dumplings and stewed chicken feet. Yesterday we sent stewed chicken feet to one of the settlements. Today we helped deliver face masks and flower cakes. This time of year in the past from morning to night, send the machine, arrange to check in, when the guide, Dizzy, now do these things, the heart is very quiet.

Usually a year to earn 300,000 no problem, who do not want to lose money inside, this year the environment is not good, indifferent mentality, do not force. I'm ready to go a year without making any money, as long as I can keep my capital.

"Many of our peers have reached the end of their lives. "

Travel Platform CEO sail

In the middle of January, a doctor friend told me that Wuhan was not doing well, but I didn't think it had anything to do with Guangdong. It was only a matter of days, from a lack of information, to a sudden outbreak of information, to a very aggressive response to the epidemic.

Tourism is the most vulnerable sector of the epidemic. In the past, the Spring Festival was the peak season, which lasted until the 15th day of the first lunar month. Compared with the usual price increases of 10% ~ 20% , our room is usually more than 800 a room, which may increase by 100 yuan. But on New Year's Eve, almost all of them were canceled. In a province where policies vary, such as Qingyuan in Guangdong, which has ordered tourist attractions and hotels to close, there are some bed and breakfasts in Huizhou, because tourism is a pillar industry in Huizhou, which simply says it should be closed.

In fact, the reality also had to close, someone put the car into the village road blocked, guests can not enter, business can not, simply stopped. B & B, Hotel owners also do not want to take risks, resulting in tension with the local government and residents, may not be able to sustain future business.

None of my peers have New Year's Eve. One group went to Jiuzhaigou Valley on the first day of the Lunar New Year. The scenic spot was closed at 11:00 pm on the 30th of the Lunar New Year. The tourists could only get a full refund. However, the profit of the travel agency of several hundred yuan per person was completely wiped out. And that's just one Jiuzhaigou Valley, where most of the country's attractions have been closed for the past few days. What I feel when I see my colleagues talking about it is that I want to cry, I really want to cry.

Many more are busy trying to get refunds from foreign travel agencies. A group of more than 40 Chinese tourists from Dubai were unable to enter the country due to the outbreak. Dubai offers two options, one is to give a breakdown of the damage, discuss with guests, accept the rest of the money back, and wait until the end of the epidemic, within a year, guests take the same trip without increase in price, can also be transferred. This gives me a lot of inspiration to deal with the current platform UNSUBSCRIBE.

Speaking of, can deal with a refund, is the test hotel, bed and breakfast, travel agencies the key to life and death. At first, when it wasn't so bad, our company tried to talk people out of it. The best solution is to change the date for free. Most of the guests are from Guangdong Province. There are many familiar customers and opportunities to consume these resources.

Shock defences have a big impact on the whole tourism industry. Tourism is a very comprehensive industry, eat, live, travel, travel, shopping, entertainment are involved in a very long chain. Occupancy rates have been less than ideal since November last year, when the Chinese New Year was supposed to be about making money. Cut It all off. Can't handle it. I'm afraid a lot of people are gonNA lose their jobs. But I am optimistic that this May Day, if the epidemic can be ended early, a core engine to boost domestic demand or tourism.

"A hole this big, cash flow is important. "

CEO  

The importance of corporate cash flow is evident in this outbreak, especially in our industry.

Our company is mainly engaged in air ticket purchasing. To do this business, first of all, you need to have the qualification of the IATA, and third-party guarantee for the reservation. After the ticket, according to twice a week to pay the Air Association.

Charter flights are a very lucrative business. Charter flights to Europe, for example, one time to put in two million, and we have a large volume of business, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars into it is normal. I calculate this time, the security deposit is nearly 100 million, plus the money paid to the airlines, out of nearly 200 million yuan.

After the outbreak of the disease, the cultural and tourism departments announced that they would stop their business. On January 24, they issued a letter saying that new tours would not be accepted from the 27th onwards. Before the 27th, the tours could travel normally. From the 27th until the end of March, they may have to be cancelled, that's like a whole quarter of earnings hit. Money back to customers, and no new business came in, the monthly cost of staff salaries 10 million, plus rent, taxes together about 15 million, a quarterly loss of 45 million yuan.

With such a big hole, cash flow is important.

Last year, we had fairly adequate fund reserve, and there were about 100 million yuan in our account. Since the start-up shareholders have not paid dividends, in addition, just before the recovery of a commission, nearly 100 million yuan, roughly calculate, can last half a year.

The New Year these days the company also did not idle, usually according to the normal refund proportion of staff arrangements, about 10 people responsible for the line. As soon as the refunds started coming in, the only people who could get them were company wide refunds, and thirty people were on call 24 hours a day.

All of a sudden, you're staring at three words on a computer —— waiting to be processed, and then calmly explaining them to a client.

The most difficult to change is overseas business, domestic non-return change policy, airlines will return to us, but like the United States, Europe, there is no outbreak of local, will not understand free change. For example, if a customer flies from Beijing to San Francisco, the ticket may be refundable for free, but if the flight is booked locally in the United States, the source will not refundable, which accounts for 20 percent of the business.
