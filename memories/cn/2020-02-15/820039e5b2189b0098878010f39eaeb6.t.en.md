* I don't know what I touched on in this article, I haven't been able to see it, self-castration.

Today, Wuhan Snow, North Wind blowing, serious snow, is not to deceive people small snow particles, I do not like to play with snow, looking only feel cold, but miss yesterday nearly 20 degrees of good weather.

Morning or rain drops, to noon began to snow, snow goose feather, as a native of the south, many years have not seen such a large snowflake, flower bed downstairs has accumulated a layer of snow. In Xi'an Meet Snow Days, go out for half an hour, umbrella can pile a small triangle, snow wrapped in small hail, can hear the rustle. I think the snow in Wuhan is soft and soft. It falls on the windowsill silently, so it melts quickly. It melts into snow water several hours after the snow has stopped.

It's cold in spring. Southern Customs don't always make for a smooth spring. You have to drag it back and forth several times. As soon as the temperature gets warmer, it drops to freezing point. My mother used to say that after the spring clothes get International Women's Day, summer clothes are almost International Workers'Day, i came back full of winter coat thick sweater, really sealed until March or April, the appropriate thin clothes are not.

The hospital began to increase the number of beds for pneumonia patients. Other patients were transferred to other hospitals or wards in groups. The transfer in the wind and snow was torture for patients and medical workers. The hospital stopped air conditioning for fear of cross contamination, in case of catching a cold in this weather, not only is it difficult to prescribe medicine, but it is also psychologically frightening to death. Patients in the ICU have to be pushed away even with oxygen bottles. Now we are concentrating our efforts on treating patients with pneumonia. Other patients have become "dark under the light" again, unable to see a doctor, unable to prescribe medicine, i can't stay in the hospital. I'm too worried about them running around in the snow. The price is getting higher and higher, and if I end up seeing the media use words like "victory" and "win" to describe the pneumonia, I think I might be sick to my stomach.

Wuhan issued the latest document early yesterday morning, the complete blockade of all communities, basic even if the declaration of "War" , only employees with proof of entry and exit, ordinary residents are not allowed to go out, ordered by the community organizations. I just don't understand how every time Wuhan releases an important document, it has to be in the middle of the night, and everyone wakes up the next morning, turns on their cell phones, their blood pressure goes through the roof, and they're pissed off when they don't get out of bed.

Today, I was complaining in the group. The notice just issued a few days ago was still warm. "One person from each family can go out every three days to purchase daily supplies. " This requirement is already very demanding. The new documents are directly cut across the board. No one is going to go out. All of you just stay put, the streets are still occasionally patrolled, private cars and pedestrians encountered, if there is no proof of the material, also directly to persuade back. Seal is always a mouth on the seal, follow-up protection is completely out of the consideration, and so on seal out a pile of problems, and then send a new file to patch.

As far as I know, many of the properties in the old residential areas are basically in a state of disappearance, and there are things that can not be contacted, not to mention organizing the purchase of vegetables to help run errands; the properties are not in groups, and it is difficult for residents in the same district to communicate. middle-aged and elderly people do not usually surf the Internet, and they can not be notified of anything, what is missing in the home can not be returned to the community in a timely manner; there are also a small number of communities that simply can not make up a group. Now, online shopping, there are no 30 or 50 copies not to be given, and there are some communities where the number of people is not enough and the demand does not match, residents are not necessarily successful in putting together a group even if they shout loudly. We have already seen quite a number of people report that their community is not reliable. After the compulsory closure of the community, they can not buy food. Their families live in difficulty. There is a message that looks painful. It says that the couple ate the fried sausages with garlic shoots for nearly 10 days, it's all stored during the Spring Festival, it's resistant to radiation, and now the sausages are almost gone, and no one cares about the neighborhood, and I don't know what to do with the rest of the day.

A lot of people say that the closure is too late, other epidemic not as serious as Wuhan areas have long been closed, I think it is because Wuhan epidemic is too serious, so can not be closed at the early stage. Up to now, materials and personnel have not yet figured out, not to mention the beginning, but what is needed and what is missing. If the gate of the community is completely locked, all the patients and their families who need to go to the hospital for examination and treatment, all the volunteers who helped distribute the supplies were unable to travel and were stuck at home, while the community had few cars and often had to wait hours to send them back. Now four categories of patients admitted more than half, the rest are healthy residents (or still in the incubation period of patients) , a lot of stress relief, just ordered the closure of the community, the implementation of strict travel control. The front of our community has long been locked, travel from the side door, the morning of the property has put a pile of vehicles in and out of the intersection of a plastic baffle, the concierge has 24-hour shift management.

The issue of not allowing front-line workers to go home also arose in our community. Some residents in the group suggested to the property that "those who go out to work should not come back, let the unit arrange accommodation and food, and don't let us isolate ourselves at home" , see My blood pressure again soaring, is ready to open in the group directly, property reply that the document does not allow to go home, now in and out have to take a temperature, understanding and also have to work. Later, the woman replied, "because her husband went to work in the morning, " ooh, it turned out that she was afraid of being infected, and hoped that the community workers would be the bad guys, and when her husband came back from work, she wouldn't let him in, and then she would go to work to make a scene, said you see our community is not allowed to go home, you give arrangements to eat and live, seal long, what people have shown their true colors.

Problems arise every day and never make it into media or public attention: There are accidents, crimes, corruption, and people protest, but we never hear of that, the Dianager is one extreme case that the simply cannot hide, and temporarily, we hear more voices and criticism via social media and informal channels.

Liu, who originally wrote about the Liangshan Brothers (I'm afraid * * I've withheld all my full name) , said the two interviews after the epidemic were both quite easy to read. Asked about the quarantine now being done in various places, especially the brutal direct closure in Wuhan, Liu said that the current situation, what is most lacking is not just mutual trust, but a community of shared, Karmic Karma in which ordinary people participate, either actively or passively, in a culture without a clear, binding ethical code, in the end, people aren't responsible for anything or anyone, including their own integrity. The face-saving epidemic prevention, brought about by the spread of panic, Stigma label, excessive epidemic prevention, doctors helpless, these reactions and practices, enduring, people's hearts as usual, the means has not changed.

Again, body, space and postmodernity by Wang Mingan: Today's social punishment is always about the body, that is, the body and its power, their availability and taming, their arrangement and subjugation... Our bodies are no longer jubilant bodies, but pessimistic, passive, stagnant bodies... [ silencing ] reach the human body by taking responsibility for life rather than threatening death. The book is an obscure collection of essays written by the author over many years, with a lot of philosophical discussion going on in front of it, which I read slowly.

Listen to the surplus pressing value discussion "nearby" . In the epidemic, many people grabbed food even more than singles' Day. Although they chose to buy food much less than themselves, at least they had fresh food to eat, the Algorithms in the black box slowly dominate our desires: when we bought something, we thought about what we wanted to buy, searched the APP, compared reviews with a circle of stores and placed orders, and now we're going straight to the front page with endless "recommendations based on your preferences / browsing. " Maybe you didn't realize what you were buying until you saw the recommendation and realized that I had to order this, and we went from now to pre, before we want.

Demand refactoring is obvious when shopping for vegetables, the APP only offers these vegetables, which may be the only ones in stock at the moment, which may be the most favorite to buy according to the Algorithm, which may be the most profitable / cost effective / seasonal vegetables, in short, to a large extent, we can't buy what we originally wanted, instead, we buy what we have, in the end, there is a cycle of "we only buy these kinds of dishes, cook these kinds of ingredients, know how to cook these kinds of dishes, and do whatever we can to make them work. ".

Caixin wrote an interview with construction workers at XX Mountain Hospital. A few days ago, there were also reports online that xx mountain workers were stranded at the scene. They pulled out the anthropomorphic skins of "little red" and "little blue" forklifts. The actual situation of workers fighting for jobs was too hard, it's almost conceivable that a massive infection. I used to stay on the project, I felt that the prefabricated house was already quite hard. My colleagues said that the next project (the site) was even more hard. Later, I went to the site safety post to study. It was 39 hot summer, wearing a safety helmet and sweating all over. I walked around every morning, noon and evening, and lived right next to the project, after reading the report on job-hunting, my projects are nothing, this is the real pay, after they finished their work, they went back to their hometown, many of them had their attacks in the quarantine zone, because of the harsh construction environment, some time ago it was raining again, working overtime to catch up on the work, and this led to poor physical resistance, so pay, the final salary is not much, but also see just received the salary immediately to buy milk donated to the good people... Publicity in praise of the "Xx Monster" , "XX speed" really dazzling.

At this point, Weibo sent me another message, "walking in the snow, " saying that sanitation workers, community workers at the grass-roots level, cleaning and disinfection workers are still holding on to their jobs and doing a good job of epidemic prevention. Why do we always encourage these efforts, why do we always like x to do x, the reflection of the problem into a commendable and collective dedication to learning.
