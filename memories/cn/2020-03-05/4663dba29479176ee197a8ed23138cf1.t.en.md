##How to enter Wuhan's "heart"

To-cure-sometimes

The function introduces, records the person and the disease, the senility, the death coexistence way.

After the closure of the city, Wuhan was once divided into two states by the virus: Families with new coronavirus infection and families without new coronavirus infection.

When the outbreak began, Liu Jun, a native of Wuhan, updated his mobile phone with a map of the outbreak almost every few moments, watching the number of infections increase and the ever widening red, white turning all red, light red turning deep red, even purple.

Anxiety and fear spread to the population as the number of infections rose, and hundreds of counseling hotlines were opened across the country.

People learn from the network, Wuhan War epidemic has fallen into the shortage of materials, reagent boxes, a bed difficult to find and other difficulties. In Wuhan, Liu Jun, whose parents began to fall ill in late January, began to understand people fleeing the city.

At his father's most critical moment, he knelt in front of his wheelchair with tears streaming down his face and listened to the unclear last words.

On February 9, Tang Wei and Liu Zhihong became the only two psychologists in the third group of medical teams to aid the Han people in Zhejiang Province, as the number of them was too small to be included in the provincial teams. It was not until a week after landing that they began to work on psychological assistance.

At the same time, du Mingjun, a local psychologist in Wuhan, told "occasional healing" that psychological crisis intervention has begun to tilt in the direction of patients' families and medical professionals. But the current problem is that, how to make the "need" and "resource" match known and completed to the special people who need it more.

"They [ the relatives of the patients ] are now in a self-survival stage as close contacts after their loved ones have left. They are part of Maslow's most basic survival needs and have no time to cope with the deepest trauma. "More often, it is the more peripheral relatives who, in a helpless state of mind, call the hotline to request intervention.

According to the international classification of mental disorders, the symptoms of traumatic stress that occur within 3 days to 1 month of exposure to a traumatic event are commonly referred to as acute stress disorder (ASD) , which occurs in many people in outbreaks.

But if the fear, avoidance and other conditions continue for more than half a year, it is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) .

On the afternoon of March 1,34 patients of Hubei Wuhan Qiao Estuary Martial Arts Square Cabin Hospital were discharged after recovery. After the remaining 76 patients have been referred, they will be treated with "resting cabin" and no more patients will be admitted.

News of the capsule reached the front-line medical community, and many felt that hope was at last "not far from home. ". "

However, Liu Zhihong wrote in his diary, "the fight against the epidemic has caused great psychological trauma to many healthcare workers. Apart from immediate psychological comfort and support, medium-and long-term psychological counseling and trauma management will be even more important in the future. ".

More than a month ago, the academician's voice was deafening, and people responded to the warning by snapping up masks. Wuhan announced the first seven designated hospitals, which were soon filled with people.

A few days after the high-level panel's arrival in Wuhan, the city was officially sealed off at 10 a.m. on January 23, the first time in nearly a century.

Born and raised in Wuhan, Liu Jun mechanically scours the news on his mobile phone, hesitating to leave his wife and daughter and go to his parents'home to care for his father, who has just been discharged from the hospital after surgery. Liu Jun supported the closure of the city and did not even understand the crowds who had fled overnight.

Du Mingjun, a psychologist in Wuhan, received a phone call from Xiao Jinsong, president of his Hubei Association of psychologists. She has been working from home ever since.

"empathetic trauma" has become a popular term to describe how ordinary people, through empathy, experience the experiences of patients and their families, and then experience physical and mental exhaustion and anxiety, even lead to their own symptoms of psychological stress trauma.

At about the same time, the Hubei Association of Psychological Counselors and the Wuhan Health and spiritual center published psychological counseling hotlines. Later, the psychological academic associations, psychological counseling associations, unions and so on all over the country to act, using the telephone, the Internet and other channels to provide public welfare advisory services.

On the evening of the New Year's Eve, more than a dozen hospitals in Wuhan jointly sent out an urgent message to the outside world asking for help. Subsequently, negative news such as the shortage of nucleic acid test kits, the difficulty of a patient dying at home and so on continued to flood the Internet, it has intensified the common people's "empathy" and panic about the epidemic area in Wuhan.

Wuhan Health and Mental Center later statistics show that the New Year's Eve alone on the day of more than 1000 missed calls, is usually 10-15 times.

The data analysis found that 70% of the early consultations were among the general public and 85.7% were not in crisis. Of the problems faced by consultants, 39% were caused by the conflicts of reality, such as buying medicine, traveling, seeking medical treatment, food masks, etc. .

It turns out that the public's awareness of and demand for psychological counseling is indeed growing at an unprecedented rate in this epidemic, and the rapid response to the establishment of professional psychological counseling teams for people who are anxious to actively seek outside help, is surely the best emotional outlet.

From volunteer registration to how to screen and train... the question Du is asked almost every time he gives an interview. Behind it is a phrase that many people still remember: "Fire and theft prevention consultant" : during the Wenchuan County earthquake, a large number of unorganized psychological counselors poured into the disaster area, but was criticized for not being professional enough to cause secondary injury to the counseling object.

Du told the website, "occasionally heal. " In general, people who can pick up the phone and ask for help have a strong incentive to support themselves.

Half of the three-tier system her hotline team operates is a direct response to an outbreak, which can calm the person down in 10-15 minutes; 40% have physical symptoms, after the first-level intervention, it was transferred to the back-office distribution, which was called back again by the consultant. The intervention lasted from 30 to 90 minutes.

Only 10% of pre existing mental health problems due to the outbreak require ongoing psychological support from a counselor or even psychiatric medication.

Little known is that technical difficulties make running a hotline more difficult than a lack of staff. For example, the consultants are through their own real-name phone calls and call back, resulting in the loss of privacy and potential problems.

The Wuhan Mental Health Center had to temporarily assemble a technical volunteer team to set up a "cloud-based" system within two days, but it took three weeks to reach the multi-lane level.

On January 27, the National Health Commission issued the guiding principles for emergency psychological crisis intervention in the case of COVID-19 pneumonia, calling for classified intervention, the first-level population (patients with severe illness and above in hospital treatment, medical and nursing staff, Disease Control and management staff on the front line of Epidemic Prevention and control) were taken as the focus of psychological crisis intervention.

About half a month after the hotline was opened, Du told the group that "occasional cure" had been set up. They have also set up special lines for medical staff and patients and their families. They are also gradually seeking opportunities to connect with designated hospitals and intervene in the isolated groups as actively as possible.

Psychologists often liken a major crisis event to a storm at sea, but the safety of one person can bring stability and hope to everyone on board, and every mental helper is the one who is safe in the storm.

"It's not the smell of the virus in the air, it's the smell of fear, " Zhang Wenhong, head of the Shanghai Medical Treatment Expert Group and Director of the hospital infection department of Mount Hua, told the media on January 29. "

Zhang said that doctors are also afraid by all kinds of media reports, and that patients in the isolation ward are even more afraid. He suggested that patients in the isolation ward and medical psychological intervention should begin immediately.

During the 2003 SARS era, a Toronto study showed that 20 percent of health care workers had symptoms of depression, and 40 percent of nurses did.

But the proportion of medical staff in the calls received by the early psychological consultation hotline was less than 5 percent. Du said the reason was that the early first-line medical staff was under a heavy workload and did not have the energy to pay attention to their emotions.

Renovation began on February 3, February 5, the first batch of officially opened shelter hospital, is responsible for receiving self-care ability of the mild diagnosis of new coronary pneumonia patients.

However, the next day, there is no electricity, low body temperature and other news, some patients also have a conflict with medical staff, and even abuse medical staff. On the other hand, the medical staff who came from all over the country also felt aggrieved.

Xiao Jinsong, director of the Department of Neurology at Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital, was the first psychologist to enter the isolation ward. He told the doctor that "occasional cure" is different from the fixed-point hospital. The square-hold Hospital has higher requirements for the mental crisis intervention ability of medical staff, without timely intervention, serious civil disorder could occur.

"As a temporary holding area, the conditions in the shelter hospital are certainly rather ordinary. Therefore, patients may feel resistance when they first check in. In addition, they may get sick and worry about their condition getting worse. They may feel lonely when they leave their families and come to an unfamiliar environment, more than medical care, it needs psychological counseling. "
Xiao Jinsong pointed out that although not all medical personnel in the shelter have a psychological background, they can provide non-professional intervention in daily care as long as they undergo simple training, "This intervention is exactly what we need right now. "

According to previous health commission documents, psychological crisis intervention should be led by the provincial epidemic prevention work headquarters, but in Wuhan, a shelter hospital often holds hundreds of thousands of people and must be responsible for multiple rescue teams at the same time.

Among the support medical teams deployed from various provinces, the priority was the department of Critical Care Medicine, infectious diseases and respiratory diseases. When Tang Wei received the order to follow the team, he was already the third support medical team sent from Zhejiang.

Along with Tang Wei was Liu Zhihong, a senior psychologist of the Wenzhou Kangning Hospital Group. This is also the first time that Zhejiang has organized a team of psychological experts to provide psychological crisis assistance services in the Wuhan Epidemic area.

Tang, Liu two experts on this mission is very clear: to ensure the psychological health of the team medical staff, patients in Wuhan to provide assistance within the capacity.

However, just arrived in Wuhan, Tang Wei and Liu Zhihong, two 50-year-old experts, once had a "hero no use" feeling of loneliness.
They wrote in their diaries that at first the team members were mostly discussing supplies, and that they were often given temporary orders to pack their newly packed bags and move them with the team.

On February 15, when the number of 1,700 medical staff infected was first disclosed, the medical team of Tang Wei and Liu Zhihong will soon enter the shelter hospital to work. "

And when the rescue team officially moved into the new shelter hospital, the role of psychological experts was immediately manifested, not only from the psychological problems of the medical staff themselves, more than that, the psychological problems of the patients in the shelter were communicated by the medical staff.

"How is the patient's mood assessed? "
"What if the patient can't sleep and doesn't want to take sleeping pills? "
"We played medical common sense or relaxing music over the radio, but some patients would protest, complain, have their heart rate increased to 100 times, and one time, they would faint when the music was played... "

One paramedic said that 80 per cent of the work in the shelter was psychological comfort, but not all paramedic knew how to comfort.

And these problems, in the Tang Wei, Liu Zhihong intervention can be timely and professional solutions.

On February 16, Liu Zhihong wrote in his diary that he brushed his mobile phone while having breakfast and suddenly saw a message from a member of the team on Wechat saying that he was wearing a protective suit and had chest tightness and breathing difficulties.

Now he went back to his room, thought for a moment and immediately wrote a report on coping strategies for chest tightness and breathing difficulties after wearing protective clothing, which he forwarded to the rescue team's work group.

In addition to these, Tang Wei and Liu Zhihong also often received first-line medical consultation hotline.

Liu Zhihong once received a call from a male doctor, he has been working in the intensive care unit for 20 days, to the fourth week, feeling physical exhaustion has reached the limit, lower limbs swelling, soreness, feel that they can not go on..

The reason is that the male doctor's height of 185 cm, but there is no suitable size of protective clothing, every day wearing a small protective clothing dare not squat, "sit on the protective clothing will crack... "

"At that moment, no matter how much comfort we gave, no matter how much truth we told, it was too easy to stand up and talk. Any special technology was feeble. The only thing to do is to gain the trust of the other person through a single channel of information (hearing) in a short period of time to create a space for them to talk and release their emotions. "

At the end of January, when Liu Jun's parents, who were in their 60s, developed fever and other symptoms of infection, many suspected patients in Wuhan had to take the drugs home for isolation and treatment because of a shortage of nucleic acid test kits.

However, once the disease worsens and patients want to be admitted to a designated hospital, they still need to get a positive nucleic acid test result, but due to the shortage of resources and the pressure of community grid management, many families have been left waiting for answers after numerous phone calls.

In the process of home isolation, many suspected patients can not be completely isolated, infected to other family members, many patients appear self-blame, guilt, and even left a note to run away from home eventually died.

At the same time, psychological experts collectively call for bringing psychosocial crisis intervention into the overall deployment of epidemic prevention and control, bringing into play the role of civil affairs and other departments with rich practical experience in relief and resettlement.

On February 8, a 70-year-old suspected patient of uremia and new pneumonia, Liang Shutao, jumped from his balcony at home and killed himself, his last words to his wife, who also had new pneumonia, were "don't want to get you in trouble. ".

Prior to this, Liang Shutao and his family had gone to the community service center several times for nucleic acid testing. However, most of the answers they got were "going through the process" and "the doctor just left work" . Even later, the service center closed its doors and no longer received people, the staff only answer the phone.

After the incident, another community worker told the occasional cure that community workers were indeed overburdened. Although they could not provide medical resources in time, they took a closed-door attitude in the face of the emotional collapse of the masses, it is a pity that there is no place for the emotions of the patients and their families to release.

"If the community had been able to communicate with the counseling team earlier, the intervention of a counselor in the event of an emotional outburst might have prevented a similar tragedy. "

Before receiving the rescue order on February 9, Tang Wei had received a letter from the Wenzhou Epidemic Prevention Command Center level, asking them to participate in psychological crisis intervention work such as centralized isolation hotels and designated hospitals.

On the evening of February 4, Tang Wei received a call from the Pingyang People's Hospital, who told him that one of the people in the mass quarantine was suffering from anxiety and even extreme fear, and from time to time he shouted "I can't survive" and needed urgent intervention.

Tang Wei learned by telephone that the 59-year-old woman from Hebei Province, who had not been to the affected area, had been quarantined because of a confirmed case on the same train.

"being away from family, relatives, unfamiliar with isolation, fear of death, loneliness and loneliness all contribute to the psychological problems of isolated people. "

Tang Wei has been involved in many major psychological interventions, and currently has 10 professional psychological intervention teams in Wenzhou, covering almost all counties and cities, even in the case of epidemic traffic control, it is also possible to quickly reach areas in urgent need of assistance through government correspondence.

Unlike a psychotherapist, Tang is a professional psychiatrist who has the power to prescribe medications, especially for patients with severe mental disorders who can be transferred to a hospital.
"The relationship between a psychologist and a psychologist is similar to that between a nurse and a doctor. A psychologist is more open to the public, but when it comes to a difficult patient, it is necessary for a professional psychologist to step in and take clinical measures. To explains to "occasional healing".

In Wuhan, however, Wenzhou's mature system of psychological intervention proved difficult to operate during the outbreak.

Xiao Jinsong once told the "occasional cure" that although the psychological counseling hotline team has the resources of authoritative experts from all over the country and even overseas, from the entire Wuhan Prevention and control measures, the first consideration is still the treatment conditions, protective materials and other practical issues, psychological crisis intervention is a spontaneous civil action, unless the way the government issued, it is difficult to cover all corners.

On the other hand, for the already hard-pressed Wuhan, the hospital cross-infection caused by the early inadequate protection also makes the medical force seriously injured, which is particularly prominent in the psychiatric hospital.

At least 50 patients and 30 medical staff at Wuhan's Mental Health Center have been infected with new crown pneumonia, according to China News Weekly.

"occasional cure" had previously confirmed that on February 16, the Wuhan Mental Health Center had to request support from infection control experts because the hospital had also been requisitioned as a new crown designated hospital to receive new pneumonia patients with mental illness.

Patients in psychiatric hospitals are more difficult to manage than those in general hospitals. In the event of cross infection, patients with mental illness are less likely to be admitted to other designated hospitals and are more likely to pose a threat to health care workers during treatment.
In recent days, the number of calls received by the general public at Du's counseling hotline has gradually declined, but as all psychologists who have come into contact with "occasional healing" have observed, psychological warfare is still a tough fight compared to epidemic prevention and control.

Liu Jun told the "occasional cure" that the most frightening thing was the perceived death. The neighborhood neighbor, who had met in the hospital the day before, only two days later saw the news of his death in the owners' group. "that strong feeling is completely different from reading other people's stories on the Internet, it's hard to imagine what it would have been like for my parents. "

"occasional cure" once came into contact with a new champion in Wuhan, Shi Ning, after discharge from the hospital alone at home isolation, and parents are in hospital treatment, in critical condition.

After her father's death, she told "occasional cure" that during the most difficult hospital admission period in Wuhan, she set herself the daily tasks she had to do, such as calling citizens' hotlines, finding contacts and seeking help online. She also set a goal of finding nucleic acid testing reagents first, get a positive report form and then find a bed. "I know, " he said. "Only when it's confirmed will I be admitted to a designated hospital. ". "

But after her father's death, she began to shut down. She didn't want to call or answer any messages. She took the initiative to escape everything. "I had to keep my mind off my father's death for a while. The URN is still at the funeral home, i don't know when I'M GONNA get it back. "

"I am grateful to my friends and family around me. Even though I don't reply to messages, they don't give up. They still contact me and pull me back. "

At first she thought she was strong enough, but "occasionally cured" learned that her mother had died of cancer in hospital shortly after, and she has not spoken to the media since.

Du has been exposed to similar cases, but she believes the trauma has only just begun for those affected by the shock.

"As a relative of a patient who has died, first and foremost as a close contact, you have to be isolated, you have to face the threat of death, and for them, the immediate priority is to survive. "

"The families of those who died were at the bottom of Maslow's list of needs, and when it became clear that they were going to survive, that the situation had stabilized, that they were going to allow themselves to go from closure to acceptance, that the trauma began to manifest. Du said that each death figure represents a family, and that real psychological crisis intervention still has a long way to go.

From the start of the outbreak, Du has been preparing for a protracted battle, and from his initial adaptation to the broadest emotional level of the public, he is gradually shifting to deep intervention by the post-traumatic stress disorder and special populations.

At present, Du is forwarding the Association's promotional posters every day. In addition to the two fixed hotlines, the dates on the posters change from day to day, accompanied by a psychological sentence, without interruption.

In a recent communication, she told the "occasional cure" that with the support of the District Women's Federation, the hotline numbers of two shelter hospitals had been posted on their walls. She looked forward to making the hotline known to more people through media publicity, especially those most in need of psychological crisis intervention.

Ten days after arriving in Wuhan, both Tang Wei and Liu Zhihong mentioned tired words for the first time in their diaries.

On March 1, when news came that the first shelter hospital was going to "close the Hatch" , the medical staff all felt that they could see hope. "The day of going home is not far away. "

However, Liu Zhihong wrote in his diary, "the fight against the epidemic has caused great psychological trauma to many healthcare workers. Apart from immediate psychological comfort and support, medium-and long-term psychological counseling and trauma management will be even more important in the future. ".

Compared with the network, television, sometimes heroic and sometimes fragile image of health care workers, Liu Zhihong diary of health care workers, more like an ordinary person, at any time with a potential outbreak of psychological pressure.

For these psychological pressures, liu Zhihong concluded: There is the fear of the virus, the boredom and loneliness of being isolated in a room for a long time after work, the "transience" of illness, the helplessness and sadness of life and death, the cold and warm disappointment caused by the separation of family members from the sick, there is the helplessness and oppression of the "white-clad soldiers" after being "heroes" , the disdain for belittling and misinterpreting the meaning and value of "psychological security" , and the "taboo illness and taboo medicine" brought about by secular prejudice

Du told occasional healing that she had gone from working day and night to a regular routine, eating and sleeping on time and maintaining a good mental state.

In anticipation of the end of the epidemic, she once wrote a poem in her circle of Friends: "How dare you talk about Cherry Blossoms, only wish to enjoy summer lotus with tears in your eyes. ". "

At his father's most critical moment, he knelt in front of his wheelchair with tears streaming down his face and listened to the unclear last words.

On February 9, Tang Wei and Liu Zhihong became the only two psychologists in the third group of medical teams to aid the Han people in Zhejiang Province, as the number of them was too small to be included in the provincial teams. It was not until a week after landing that they began to work on psychological assistance.

At the same time, du Mingjun, a local psychologist in Wuhan, told "occasional healing" that psychological crisis intervention has begun to tilt in the direction of patients' families and medical professionals. But the current problem is that, how to make the "need" and "resource" match known and completed to the special people who need it more.

"They [ the relatives of the patients ] are now in a self-survival stage as close contacts after their loved ones have left. They are part of Maslow's most basic survival needs and have no time to cope with the deepest trauma. "More often, it is the more peripheral relatives who, in a helpless state of mind, call the hotline to request intervention.

According to the international classification of mental disorders, the symptoms of traumatic stress that occur within 3 days to 1 month of exposure to a traumatic event are commonly referred to as acute stress disorder (ASD) , which occurs in many people in outbreaks.

But if the fear, avoidance and other conditions continue for more than half a year, it is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) .

On the afternoon of March 1,34 patients of Hubei Wuhan Qiao Estuary Martial Arts Square Cabin Hospital were discharged after recovery. After the remaining 76 patients have been referred, they will be treated with "resting cabin" and no more patients will be admitted.

News of the capsule reached the front-line medical community, and many felt that hope was at last "not far from home. ". "

However, Liu Zhihong wrote in his diary, "the fight against the epidemic has caused great psychological trauma to many healthcare workers. Apart from immediate psychological comfort and support, medium-and long-term psychological counseling and trauma management will be even more important in the future. ".

More than a month ago, the academician's voice was deafening, and people responded to the warning by snapping up masks. Wuhan announced the first seven designated hospitals, which were soon filled with people.

A few days after the high-level panel's arrival in Wuhan, the city was officially sealed off at 10 a.m. on January 23, the first time in nearly a century.

Born and raised in Wuhan, Liu Jun mechanically scours the news on his mobile phone, hesitating to leave his wife and daughter and go to his parents'home to care for his father, who has just been discharged from the hospital after surgery. Liu Jun supported the closure of the city and did not even understand the crowds who had fled overnight.

Du Mingjun, a psychologist in Wuhan, received a phone call from Xiao Jinsong, president of his Hubei Association of psychologists. She has been working from home ever since.

"empathetic trauma" has become a popular term to describe how ordinary people, through empathy, experience the experiences of patients and their families, and then experience physical and mental exhaustion and anxiety, even lead to their own symptoms of psychological stress trauma.

At about the same time, the Hubei Association of Psychological Counselors and the Wuhan Health and spiritual center published psychological counseling hotlines. Later, the psychological academic associations, psychological counseling associations, unions and so on all over the country to act, using the telephone, the Internet and other channels to provide public welfare advisory services.

On the evening of the New Year's Eve, more than a dozen hospitals in Wuhan jointly sent out an urgent message to the outside world asking for help. Subsequently, negative news such as the shortage of nucleic acid test kits, the difficulty of a patient dying at home and so on continued to flood the Internet, it has intensified the common people's "empathy" and panic about the epidemic area in Wuhan.

Wuhan Health and Mental Center later statistics show that the New Year's Eve alone on the day of more than 1000 missed calls, is usually 10-15 times.

The data analysis found that 70% of the early consultations were among the general public and 85.7% were not in crisis. Of the problems faced by consultants, 39% were caused by the conflicts of reality, such as buying medicine, traveling, seeking medical treatment, food masks, etc. .

It turns out that the public's awareness of and demand for psychological counseling is indeed growing at an unprecedented rate in this epidemic, and the rapid response to the establishment of professional psychological counseling teams for people who are anxious to actively seek outside help, is surely the best emotional outlet.

From volunteer registration to how to screen and train... the question Du is asked almost every time he gives an interview. Behind it is a phrase that many people still remember: "Fire and theft prevention consultant" : during the Wenchuan County earthquake, a large number of unorganized psychological counselors poured into the disaster area, but was criticized for not being professional enough to cause secondary injury to the counseling object.

Du told the website, "occasionally heal. " In general, people who can pick up the phone and ask for help have a strong incentive to support themselves.

Half of the three-tier system her hotline team operates is a direct response to an outbreak, which can calm the person down in 10-15 minutes; 40% have physical symptoms, after the first-level intervention, it was transferred to the back-office distribution, which was called back again by the consultant. The intervention lasted from 30 to 90 minutes.

Only 10% of pre existing mental health problems due to the outbreak require ongoing psychological support from a counselor or even psychiatric medication.

Little known is that technical difficulties make running a hotline more difficult than a lack of staff. For example, the consultants are through their own real-name phone calls and call back, resulting in the loss of privacy and potential problems.

The Wuhan Mental Health Center had to temporarily assemble a technical volunteer team to set up a "cloud-based" system within two days, but it took three weeks to reach the multi-lane level.

On January 27, the National Health Commission issued the guiding principles for emergency psychological crisis intervention in the case of COVID-19 pneumonia, calling for classified intervention, the first-level population (patients with severe illness and above in hospital treatment, medical and nursing staff, Disease Control and management staff on the front line of Epidemic Prevention and control) were taken as the focus of psychological crisis intervention.

About half a month after the hotline was opened, Du told the group that "occasional cure" had been set up. They have also set up special lines for medical staff and patients and their families. They are also gradually seeking opportunities to connect with designated hospitals and intervene in the isolated groups as actively as possible.

Psychologists often liken a major crisis event to a storm at sea, but the safety of one person can bring stability and hope to everyone on board, and every mental helper is the one who is safe in the storm.

"It's not the smell of the virus in the air, it's the smell of fear, " Zhang Wenhong, head of the Shanghai Medical Treatment Expert Group and Director of the hospital infection department of Mount Hua, told the media on January 29. "

Zhang said that doctors are also afraid by all kinds of media reports, and that patients in the isolation ward are even more afraid. He suggested that patients in the isolation ward and medical psychological intervention should begin immediately.

During the 2003 SARS era, a Toronto study showed that 20 percent of health care workers had symptoms of depression, and 40 percent of nurses did.

But the proportion of medical staff in the calls received by the early psychological consultation hotline was less than 5 percent. Du said the reason was that the early first-line medical staff was under a heavy workload and did not have the energy to pay attention to their emotions.

Renovation began on February 3, February 5, the first batch of officially opened shelter hospital, is responsible for receiving self-care ability of the mild diagnosis of new coronary pneumonia patients.

However, the next day, there is no electricity, low body temperature and other news, some patients also have a conflict with medical staff, and even abuse medical staff. On the other hand, the medical staff who came from all over the country also felt aggrieved.

Xiao Jinsong, director of the Department of Neurology at Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital, was the first psychologist to enter the isolation ward. He told the doctor that "occasional cure" is different from the fixed-point hospital. The square-hold Hospital has higher requirements for the mental crisis intervention ability of medical staff, without timely intervention, serious civil disorder could occur.

"As a temporary holding area, the conditions in the shelter hospital are certainly rather ordinary. Therefore, patients may feel resistance when they first check in. In addition, they may get sick and worry about their condition getting worse. They may feel lonely when they leave their families and come to an unfamiliar environment, more than medical care, it needs psychological counseling. "
Xiao Jinsong pointed out that although not all medical personnel in the shelter have a psychological background, they can provide non-professional intervention in daily care as long as they undergo simple training, "This intervention is exactly what we need right now. "

According to previous health commission documents, psychological crisis intervention should be led by the provincial epidemic prevention work headquarters, but in Wuhan, a shelter hospital often holds hundreds of thousands of people and must be responsible for multiple rescue teams at the same time.

Among the support medical teams deployed from various provinces, the priority was the department of Critical Care Medicine, infectious diseases and respiratory diseases. When Tang Wei received the order to follow the team, he was already the third support medical team sent from Zhejiang.

Along with Tang Wei was Liu Zhihong, a senior psychologist of the Wenzhou Kangning Hospital Group. This is also the first time that Zhejiang has organized a team of psychological experts to provide psychological crisis assistance services in the Wuhan Epidemic area.

Tang, Liu two experts on this mission is very clear: to ensure the psychological health of the team medical staff, patients in Wuhan to provide assistance within the capacity.

However, just arrived in Wuhan, Tang Wei and Liu Zhihong, two 50-year-old experts, once had a "hero no use" feeling of loneliness.
They wrote in their diaries that at first the team members were mostly discussing supplies, and that they were often given temporary orders to pack their newly packed bags and move them with the team.

On February 15, when the number of 1,700 medical staff infected was first disclosed, the medical team of Tang Wei and Liu Zhihong will soon enter the shelter hospital to work. "

And when the rescue team officially moved into the new shelter hospital, the role of psychological experts was immediately manifested, not only from the psychological problems of the medical staff themselves, more than that, the psychological problems of the patients in the shelter were communicated by the medical staff.

"How is the patient's mood assessed? "
"What if the patient can't sleep and doesn't want to take sleeping pills? "
"We played medical common sense or relaxing music over the radio, but some patients would protest, complain, have their heart rate increased to 100 times, and one time, they would faint when the music was played... "

One paramedic said that 80 per cent of the work in the shelter was psychological comfort, but not all paramedic knew how to comfort.

And these problems, in the Tang Wei, Liu Zhihong intervention can be timely and professional solutions.

On February 16, Liu Zhihong wrote in his diary that he brushed his mobile phone while having breakfast and suddenly saw a message from a member of the team on Wechat saying that he was wearing a protective suit and had chest tightness and breathing difficulties.

Now he went back to his room, thought for a moment and immediately wrote a report on coping strategies for chest tightness and breathing difficulties after wearing protective clothing, which he forwarded to the rescue team's work group.

In addition to these, Tang Wei and Liu Zhihong also often received first-line medical consultation hotline.

Liu Zhihong once received a call from a male doctor, he has been working in the intensive care unit for 20 days, to the fourth week, feeling physical exhaustion has reached the limit, lower limbs swelling, soreness, feel that they can not go on..

The reason is that the male doctor's height of 185 cm, but there is no suitable size of protective clothing, every day wearing a small protective clothing dare not squat, "sit on the protective clothing will crack... "

"At that moment, no matter how much comfort we gave, no matter how much truth we told, it was too easy to stand up and talk. Any special technology was feeble. The only thing to do is to gain the trust of the other person through a single channel of information (hearing) in a short period of time to create a space for them to talk and release their emotions. "

At the end of January, when Liu Jun's parents, who were in their 60s, developed fever and other symptoms of infection, many suspected patients in Wuhan had to take the drugs home for isolation and treatment because of a shortage of nucleic acid test kits.

However, once the disease worsens and patients want to be admitted to a designated hospital, they still need to get a positive nucleic acid test result, but due to the shortage of resources and the pressure of community grid management, many families have been left waiting for answers after numerous phone calls.

In the process of home isolation, many suspected patients can not be completely isolated, infected to other family members, many patients appear self-blame, guilt, and even left a note to run away from home eventually died.

At the same time, psychological experts collectively call for bringing psychosocial crisis intervention into the overall deployment of epidemic prevention and control, bringing into play the role of civil affairs and other departments with rich practical experience in relief and resettlement.

On February 8, a 70-year-old suspected patient of uremia and new pneumonia, Liang Shutao, jumped from his balcony at home and killed himself, his last words to his wife, who also had new pneumonia, were "don't want to get you in trouble. ".

Prior to this, Liang Shutao and his family had gone to the community service center several times for nucleic acid testing. However, most of the answers they got were "going through the process" and "the doctor just left work" . Even later, the service center closed its doors and no longer received people, the staff only answer the phone.

After the incident, another community worker told the occasional cure that community workers were indeed overburdened. Although they could not provide medical resources in time, they took a closed-door attitude in the face of the emotional collapse of the masses, it is a pity that there is no place for the emotions of the patients and their families to release.

"If the community had been able to communicate with the counseling team earlier, the intervention of a counselor in the event of an emotional outburst might have prevented a similar tragedy. "

Before receiving the rescue order on February 9, Tang Wei had received a letter from the Wenzhou Epidemic Prevention Command Center level, asking them to participate in psychological crisis intervention work such as centralized isolation hotels and designated hospitals.

On the evening of February 4, Tang Wei received a call from the Pingyang People's Hospital, who told him that one of the people in the mass quarantine was suffering from anxiety and even extreme fear, and from time to time he shouted "I can't survive" and needed urgent intervention.

Tang Wei learned by telephone that the 59-year-old woman from Hebei Province, who had not been to the affected area, had been quarantined because of a confirmed case on the same train.

"being away from family, relatives, unfamiliar with isolation, fear of death, loneliness and loneliness all contribute to the psychological problems of isolated people. "

Tang Wei has been involved in many major psychological interventions, and currently has 10 professional psychological intervention teams in Wenzhou, covering almost all counties and cities, even in the case of epidemic traffic control, it is also possible to quickly reach areas in urgent need of assistance through government correspondence.

Unlike a psychotherapist, Tang is a professional psychiatrist who has the power to prescribe medications, especially for patients with severe mental disorders who can be transferred to a hospital.
"The relationship between a psychologist and a psychologist is similar to that between a nurse and a doctor. A psychologist is more open to the public, but when it comes to a difficult patient, it is necessary for a professional psychologist to step in and take clinical measures. To explains to "occasional healing".

In Wuhan, however, Wenzhou's mature system of psychological intervention proved difficult to operate during the outbreak.

Xiao Jinsong once told the "occasional cure" that although the psychological counseling hotline team has the resources of authoritative experts from all over the country and even overseas, from the entire Wuhan Prevention and control measures, the first consideration is still the treatment conditions, protective materials and other practical issues, psychological crisis intervention is a spontaneous civil action, unless the way the government issued, it is difficult to cover all corners.

On the other hand, for the already hard-pressed Wuhan, the hospital cross-infection caused by the early inadequate protection also makes the medical force seriously injured, which is particularly prominent in the psychiatric hospital.

At least 50 patients and 30 medical staff at Wuhan's Mental Health Center have been infected with new crown pneumonia, according to China News Weekly.

"occasional cure" had previously confirmed that on February 16, the Wuhan Mental Health Center had to request support from infection control experts because the hospital had also been requisitioned as a new crown designated hospital to receive new pneumonia patients with mental illness.

Patients in psychiatric hospitals are more difficult to manage than those in general hospitals. In the event of cross infection, patients with mental illness are less likely to be admitted to other designated hospitals and are more likely to pose a threat to health care workers during treatment.
In recent days, the number of calls received by the general public at Du's counseling hotline has gradually declined, but as all psychologists who have come into contact with "occasional healing" have observed, psychological warfare is still a tough fight compared to epidemic prevention and control.

Four

Liu Jun told the "occasional cure" that the most frightening thing was the perceived death. The neighborhood neighbor, who had met in the hospital the day before, only two days later saw the news of his death in the owners' group. "that strong feeling is completely different from reading other people's stories on the Internet, it's hard to imagine what it would have been like for my parents. "

"occasional cure" once came into contact with a new champion in Wuhan, Shi Ning, after discharge from the hospital alone at home isolation, and parents are in hospital treatment, in critical condition.

After her father's death, she told "occasional cure" that during the most difficult hospital admission period in Wuhan, she set herself the daily tasks she had to do, such as calling citizens' hotlines, finding contacts and seeking help online. She also set a goal of finding nucleic acid testing reagents first, get a positive report form and then find a bed. "I know, " he said. "Only when it's confirmed will I be admitted to a designated hospital. ". "

But after her father's death, she began to shut down. She didn't want to call or answer any messages. She took the initiative to escape everything. "I had to keep my mind off my father's death for a while. The URN is still at the funeral home, i don't know when I'M GONNA get it back. "

"I am grateful to my friends and family around me. Even though I don't reply to messages, they don't give up. They still contact me and pull me back. "

At first she thought she was strong enough, but "occasionally cured" learned that her mother had died of cancer in hospital shortly after, and she has not spoken to the media since.

Du has been exposed to similar cases, but she believes the trauma has only just begun for those affected by the shock.

"As a relative of a patient who has died, first and foremost as a close contact, you have to be isolated, you have to face the threat of death, and for them, the immediate priority is to survive. "

"The families of those who died were at the bottom of Maslow's list of needs, and when it became clear that they were going to survive, that the situation had stabilized, that they were going to allow themselves to go from closure to acceptance, that the trauma began to manifest. Du said that each death figure represents a family, and that real psychological crisis intervention still has a long way to go.

From the start of the outbreak, Du has been preparing for a protracted battle, and from his initial adaptation to the broadest emotional level of the public, he is gradually shifting to deep intervention by the post-traumatic stress disorder and special populations.

Daily poster of Hubei Psychological Consultant Association

At present, Du is forwarding the Association's promotional posters every day. In addition to the two fixed hotlines, the dates on the posters change from day to day, accompanied by a psychological sentence, without interruption.

In a recent communication, she told the "occasional cure" that with the support of the District Women's Federation, the hotline numbers of two shelter hospitals had been posted on their walls. She looked forward to making the hotline known to more people through media publicity, especially those most in need of psychological crisis intervention.

Ten days after arriving in Wuhan, both Tang Wei and Liu Zhihong mentioned tired words for the first time in their diaries.

On March 1, when news came that the first shelter hospital was going to "close the Hatch" , the medical staff all felt that they could see hope. "The day of going home is not far away. "

However, Liu Zhihong wrote in his diary, "the fight against the epidemic has caused great psychological trauma to many healthcare workers. Apart from immediate psychological comfort and support, medium-and long-term psychological counseling and trauma management will be even more important in the future. ".

Compared with the network, television, sometimes heroic and sometimes fragile image of health care workers, Liu Zhihong diary of health care workers, more like an ordinary person, at any time with a potential outbreak of psychological pressure.

For these psychological pressures, liu Zhihong concluded: There is the fear of the virus, the boredom and loneliness of being isolated in a room for a long time after work, the "transience" of illness, the helplessness and sadness of life and death, the cold and warm disappointment caused by the separation of family members from the sick, there is the helplessness and oppression of the "white-clad soldiers" after being "heroes" , the disdain for belittling and misinterpreting the meaning and value of "psychological security" , and the "taboo illness and taboo medicine" brought about by secular prejudice

Du told occasional healing that she had gone from working day and night to a regular routine, eating and sleeping on time and maintaining a good mental state.

In anticipation of the end of the epidemic, she once wrote a poem in her circle of Friends: "How dare you talk about Cherry Blossoms, only wish to enjoy summer lotus with tears in your eyes. ". "

Psychologists often liken a major crisis event to a storm at sea, but the safety of one person can bring stability and hope to everyone on board, and every mental helper is the one who is safe in the storm.

"It's not the smell of the virus in the air, it's the smell of fear, " Zhang Wenhong, head of the Shanghai Medical Treatment Expert Group and Director of the hospital infection department of Mount Hua, told the media on January 29. "

Zhang said that doctors are also afraid by all kinds of media reports, and that patients in the isolation ward are even more afraid. He suggested that patients in the isolation ward and medical psychological intervention should begin immediately.

Even later, the service center closed its doors and no longer received people, the staff only answer the phone.

After the incident, another community worker told the occasional cure that community workers were indeed overburdened. Although they could not provide medical resources in time, they took a closed-door attitude in the face of the emotional collapse of the masses, it is a pity that there is no place for the emotions of the patients and their families to release.

"If the community had been able to communicate with the counseling team earlier, the intervention of a counselor in the event of an emotional outburst might have prevented a similar tragedy. "

Before receiving the rescue order on February 9, Tang Wei had received a letter from the Wenzhou Epidemic Prevention Command Center level, asking them to participate in psychological crisis intervention work such as centralized isolation hotels and designated hospitals.

On the evening of February 4, Tang Wei received a call from the Pingyang People's Hospital, who told him that one of the people in the mass quarantine was suffering from anxiety and even extreme fear, and from time to time he shouted "I can't survive" and needed urgent intervention.

Tang Wei learned by telephone that the 59-year-old woman from Hebei Province, who had not been to the affected area, had been quarantined because of a confirmed case on the same train.

"being away from family, relatives, unfamiliar with isolation, fear of death, loneliness and loneliness all contribute to the psychological problems of isolated people. "

Tang Wei has been involved in many major psychological interventions, and currently has 10 professional psychological intervention teams in Wenzhou, covering almost all counties and cities, even in the case of epidemic traffic control, it is also possible to quickly reach areas in urgent need of assistance through government correspondence.

Unlike a psychotherapist, Tang is a professional psychiatrist who has the power to prescribe medications, especially for patients with severe mental disorders who can be transferred to a hospital.

"The relationship between a psychologist and a psychologist is similar to that between a nurse and a doctor. A psychologist is more open to the public, but when it comes to a difficult patient, it is necessary for a professional psychologist to step in and take clinical measures. To explains to "occasional healing".

In Wuhan, however, Wenzhou's mature system of psychological intervention proved difficult to operate during the outbreak.

Xiao Jinsong once told the "occasional cure" that although the psychological counseling hotline team has the resources of authoritative experts from all over the country and even overseas, from the entire Wuhan Prevention and control measures, the first consideration is still the treatment conditions, protective materials and other practical issues, psychological crisis intervention is a spontaneous civil action, unless the way the government issued, it is difficult to cover all corners.

On the other hand, for the already hard-pressed Wuhan, the hospital cross-infection caused by the early inadequate protection also makes the medical force seriously injured, which is particularly prominent in the psychiatric hospital.

At least 50 patients and 30 medical staff at Wuhan's Mental Health Center have been infected with new crown pneumonia, according to China News Weekly.

"occasional cure" had previously confirmed that on February 16, the Wuhan Mental Health Center had to request support from infection control experts because the hospital had also been requisitioned as a new crown designated hospital to receive new pneumonia patients with mental illness.

Patients in psychiatric hospitals are more difficult to manage than those in general hospitals. In the event of cross infection, patients with mental illness are less likely to be admitted to other designated hospitals and are more likely to pose a threat to health care workers during treatment.

In recent days, the number of calls received by the general public at Du's counseling hotline has gradually declined, but as all psychologists who have come into contact with "occasional healing" have observed, psychological warfare is still a tough fight compared to epidemic prevention and control.

Four

Liu Jun told the "occasional cure" that the most frightening thing was the perceived death. The neighborhood neighbor, who had met in the hospital the day before, only two days later saw the news of his death in the owners' group. "that strong feeling is completely different from reading other people's stories on the Internet, it's hard to imagine what it would have been like for my parents. "

"occasional cure" once came into contact with a new champion in Wuhan, Shi Ning, after discharge from the hospital alone at home isolation, and parents are in hospital treatment, in critical condition.

After her father's death, she told "occasional cure" that during the most difficult hospital admission period in Wuhan, she set herself the daily tasks she had to do, such as calling citizens' hotlines, finding contacts and seeking help online. She also set a goal of finding nucleic acid testing reagents first, get a positive report form and then find a bed. "I know, " he said. "Only when it's confirmed will I be admitted to a designated hospital. ". "

But after her father's death, she began to shut down. She didn't want to call or answer any messages. She took the initiative to escape everything. "I had to keep my mind off my father's death for a while. The URN is still at the funeral home, i don't know when I'M GONNA get it back. "

"I am grateful to my friends and family around me. Even though I don't reply to messages, they don't give up. They still contact me and pull me back. "

At first she thought she was strong enough, but "occasionally cured" learned that her mother had died of cancer in hospital shortly after, and she has not spoken to the media since.

Du has been exposed to similar cases, but she believes the trauma has only just begun for those affected by the shock.

"As a relative of a patient who has died, first and foremost as a close contact, you have to be isolated, you have to face the threat of death, and for them, the immediate priority is to survive. "

"The families of those who died were at the bottom of Maslow's list of needs, and when it became clear that they were going to survive, that the situation had stabilized, that they were going to allow themselves to go from closure to acceptance, that the trauma began to manifest. Du said that each death figure represents a family, and that real psychological crisis intervention still has a long way to go.

From the start of the outbreak, Du has been preparing for a protracted battle, and from his initial adaptation to the broadest emotional level of the public, he is gradually shifting to deep intervention by the post-traumatic stress disorder and special populations.

Daily poster of Hubei Psychological Consultant Association

At present, Du is forwarding the Association's promotional posters every day. In addition to the two fixed hotlines, the dates on the posters change from day to day, accompanied by a psychological sentence, without interruption.

In a recent communication, she told the "occasional cure" that with the support of the District Women's Federation, the hotline numbers of two shelter hospitals had been posted on their walls. She looked forward to making the hotline known to more people through media publicity, especially those most in need of psychological crisis intervention.

Ten days after arriving in Wuhan, both Tang Wei and Liu Zhihong mentioned tired words for the first time in their diaries.

On March 1, when news came that the first shelter hospital was going to "close the Hatch" , the medical staff all felt that they could see hope. "The day of going home is not far away. "

However, Liu Zhihong wrote in his diary, "the fight against the epidemic has caused great psychological trauma to many healthcare workers. Apart from immediate psychological comfort and support, medium-and long-term psychological counseling and trauma management will be even more important in the future. ".

Compared with the network, television, sometimes heroic and sometimes fragile image of health care workers, Liu Zhihong diary of health care workers, more like an ordinary person, at any time with a potential outbreak of psychological pressure.

For these psychological pressures, liu Zhihong concluded: There is the fear of the virus, the boredom and loneliness of being isolated in a room for a long time after work, the "transience" of illness, the helplessness and sadness of life and death, the cold and warm disappointment caused by the separation of family members from the sick, there is the helplessness and oppression of the "white-clad soldiers" after being "heroes" , the disdain for belittling and misinterpreting the meaning and value of "psychological security" , and the "taboo illness and taboo medicine" brought about by secular prejudice

Du told occasional healing that she had gone from working day and night to a regular routine, eating and sleeping on time and maintaining a good mental state.

In anticipation of the end of the epidemic, she once wrote a poem in her circle of Friends: "How dare you talk about Cherry Blossoms, only wish to enjoy summer lotus with tears in your eyes. ". "
