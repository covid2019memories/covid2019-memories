In late February, the last patient in the ward was discharged from the hospital. In February, head nurse Jia Xiaohui went from zero to zero again.

On Feb. 29, the first time in four years, Jia and her colleagues said goodbye to all the new patients in the 17 wards. In March, her new assignment was to clean the ward thoroughly and then undergo 14 days of concentrated isolation. Jiangnan's spring is coming, the medical staff who have been fighting for many days can also have time to look out the window of the Green.

Previously, Wenzhou has 13 consecutive days without new confirmed cases, the city, all counties, cities and districts are listed as low-risk areas. Wenzhou Health Commission Director Chen Hongming announced on March 2, the first round of epidemic prevention and control of the full sprint to zero, epidemic prevention and control achieved a victory in stages.

With the epidemic under control, Wenzhou, a city with a thriving private economy, has shifted its focus to returning to work and production, and the government and enterprises have made great efforts to attract people from other parts of the country to work in Wenzhou: The government chartered trains and planes to pick up migrant workers at full cost as of March 2, a total of 11,673 returnees were received by 521"through trains for resuming work" , and a one-off subsidy of 1,000 yuan per person was given to employees who had signed employment contract for more than one year and paid social insurance according to law when they first came to Wenzhou for employment outside the city.

Just a month ago, it was a dangerous epidemic. At one point in early February, more cases were confirmed in Wenzhou than in the entire province of Jiangsu, making it the city with the highest number of confirmed cases outside of Hubei.

It's been an extraordinary month. The medical system of classified strategy was the first to bear the brunt: the Wenzhou version of "Xiaotangshan" hospital was put into use for 10 days, and together with the original Infectious Disease Hospital, the hospital was designated as a new hospital for the treatment of patients, wenzhou, the strongest comprehensive strength of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenyi University is responsible for the admission of serious patients.

From now until 2400 hours on February 8, residents were required to "stay at home for seven days and never leave their homes. " Only one member of each family can be assigned to go out every two days to purchase supplies.

The department store posted a notice on January 22: "business will be suspended due to environmental cleaning. ".

"We have more than 1,000 sales assistants, and people who went into the shopping malls during that period should observe at home, " Ms. Chen, a saleswoman for a women's clothing brand at Yintai department store, told CAIJING. She was quarantined at her home on January 22, and was notified by the community on February 1 to go to a hotel to be quarantined, ending quarantine on February 6.

The Wenzhou daily, the local state run newspaper, recorded the day: a full scale defense campaign involving 100,000 people was launched, with big data targeting people who had stayed nearby for more than 15 minutes and residents of surrounding communities, in the end, 28 patients out of 100,000 were accurately identified.

From department store to the Corner Shop, all close contacts should be quarantined whenever there is a confirmed case. According to a report by the Zhejiang Television, after the owner of a dried powder shop in Ouhai district of Wenzhou was confirmed, Wenzhou found 3,615 people passing through the dried powder shop through the big data platform of the three major operators, and contacted them by phone one by one to check them out, eventually, they found 40 customers and took action.

On January 28, dozens of new cases were reported daily in Wenzhou, leading to on-site epidemic prevention and control supervision by the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, relevant leaders stressed: "The situation of epidemic prevention and control is grim. We must further mobilize the masses, make cadres at all levels tense up, and strive to make the inflection point of the epidemic come as soon as possible. " Since then, Wenzhou has stepped up its prevention and control measures, the effects are becoming more pronounced.

On the evening of January 31, Wenzhou launched "25 emergency measures" to prevent and control the epidemic, it mainly includes: suspension of city public transport, ferry, city railway and other public transport, suspension of inter-provincial, inter-city and county passenger transport routes, resumption of work by enterprises no earlier than 24:00 on February 17, starting work by government departments and institutions from February 9, school extension to March 1 after the start of the school, before entering the supermarket, vegetable market, pharmacy temperature test, etc. .

" Each family can only assign one family member to go out every two days to purchase living materials. The two-day rule, which allows only one person to leave the house, was previously enforced in Huanggang, Hubei Province, where more than 1,000 cases were confirmed.

In Yueqing, where the worst outbreak occurred, residents were banned from shopping on the streets even earlier than in Wuhan, the National Center for the epidemic, requiring that supplies must be collectively procured through village committees and neighborhood committees, and centrally and uniformly distributed by distribution companies.

Wenzhou, Deputy Party secretary and Mayor Yao Gaoyuan on February 2 afternoon, "25" introduced 40 hours, Wenzhou, all key objects fully implemented hard-isolated control. In addition to the 3,588 close contacts of the concentrated isolation, Wenzhou original home isolation of 16,649 people have been transferred to concentrated isolation, the city's total number of concentrated isolation of 20,237 people.

After controlling the city's travel, Wenzhou also tightened restrictions on foreign traffic, temporarily closing 46 of the city's 55 high-speed toll stations. On February 6th, for example, only nine Wenzhou to Hangzhou trains remained, and 96 trains were suspended.

Swift grass-roots control is quick to take effect. "The new year twenty-nine and 30 were quite busy, with more than 100 fever outpatients a day, " Zheng, a doctor at the fever clinic of the First Affiliated Hospital of the Wenzhou Medical College, told Caijing. "later, because those who returned from Wuhan were all controlled and quarantined, the number of people coming to see a doctor dropped, and there was a marked drop after the third day. "

03
Rapid bed opening, low critical rate, high cure rate

Doctors, though, are nervous about the virus's infectiousness. "The medical staff themselves are afraid of the virus, " a front-line doctor at the Second Hospital affiliated to the Wenzhou Medical College told Caijing, "But we're not very nervous because we don't have that many patients, and apart from the lack of protective equipment, the staff and beds are all available. "

Unlike in some cities, where beds are tight, Wenzhou has plenty of beds in general, even when the disease is at its most dangerous.

CAIJING reporter learned from Dr. Zheng of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenyi University that the hospital has a capacity of 150 patients. According to the development of the epidemic situation, the ward can be further adjusted and renovated. The utilization rate of beds is less than half at present, with four hundred confirmed cases in the entire city of Wenzhou, "I can cope with being spread out among so many hospitals. "

To the comfort of Wenzhou people is that the special treatment of confirmed patients in Wenzhou, "Xiaotangshan" hospital is in place. According to Shen Xian, director of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, on January 28, the hospital received a request from the municipal government to open the second affiliated hospital of Wenyi University, Oujiangkou Hospital area, within 10 days. The district is positioned as an orthopaedic hospital and was originally scheduled to start operating in April 2020. The renovation was completed on February 4, and two wards were opened on February 6, with the capacity to treat 100 patients and gradually expand the capacity of admission.

According to official statistics, it took only five hours for the sixth people's Hospital of Wenzhou, an Infectious Disease Hospital, to be put in place with 120 beds and Wenzhou Xiaotangshan Hospital with 800 beds Severe and critical patients were collected and treated by the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenyi University, which had the strongest comprehensive strength. Ten designated hospitals have been set up in the city, with a total of 1,474 open beds and a total of 2,150 reserved hospital beds. 2,036 medics are on the front lines, and 35 are flying to Wuhan.

Because of sufficient beds, Wenzhou found suspected, mild, severe cases are now able to do all admission. "because our hospital is designated to treat patients with severe illness, some patients directly from the county to pull over. Mild cases of lung change is not fast, are observed in the hospital, some people even do not need infusion. All suspected patients will also be sent to the ward, and one room each,"Zheng told CAIJING.".

"In addition to the confirmed patients, Wenzhou will also include suspected patients in its policy to benefit them, " Peng Weibin, director of the Wenzhou Medical Insurance Bureau, said at a press conference on February 3. "after the basic medical insurance, Major Disease Insurance and medical assistance are paid according to regulations, " Peng said, the individual contribution shall be partly subsidized by the public finance, and a comprehensive guarantee shall be implemented. In short, patients do not in principle have to bear the cost of medical care, all by the Health Insurance Fund and Finance.

From the beginning of epidemic prevention, the cases in Wenzhou have shown the characteristics of low rate of severe cases and high cure rate. On February 4th, for example, of the 364 confirmed cases in Wenzhou, 22 were critical, with a 6% critical rate, half the national average of 13% , and 28 were discharged, with a cure rate of 8% , far higher than the national average of 2% .

In ten days, wenzhou has issued a series of policy documents, such as "some measures to cope with the epidemic of new crown pneumonia and support small and medium-sized enterprises to tide over the difficulties" and "implementation opinions on resolutely winning the war of prevention and control of the epidemic of new crown pneumonia and taking the initiative in development" , it includes 60 policies and measures such as tax and fee reduction, employment stabilization and financial support. According to official estimates, the city is expected to reduce the burden of enterprises by nearly 9 billion yuan.

Enterprises affected by the epidemic are entitled to 1-3 months of Interest Relief and loans of up to 1 million yuan, and the loan interest rate in the original basis to float down more than 10% .

At the same time, Wenzhou sorted out 4,019 leading enterprises, set up an initial RMB 6 billion emergency special credit, to ensure the financing needs of enterprises.

Hiring is also a top priority. As a labor-intensive industry, off-line job fairs have been held in Wenzhou. Wenzhou business daily reported that, in order to solve the problem of "difficult to recruit workers and difficult to find jobs" , the 2020 recruitment fair for key enterprises in Wenzhou, capital of China's shoe industry, was held from March 1 to March 8. More than 50 units provided more than 1,000 jobs on the spot.

Local recruitment is not enough, Wenzhou Ouhai District has set up a "100-person recruitment team" of 100 cadres to go to Jiangxi, Anhui, Guizhou and other places to launch full-time recruitment, each special class plan to recruit at least 2,000 people, the mission is not complete, the squad will not be withdrawn.

On the evening of February 23, two high-speed trains, one from Guiyang and the other from Chengdu, arrived, bringing nearly 1,800 employees from 106 companies back to Wenzhou. The Wenzhou government has sent representatives of companies back to work to pick up trains at stations. The government pays for all the costs of the special trains. As of March 2, a total of 11,673 returnees were received by 521"through trains for resuming work" .

Wenzhou has set aside 200 million yuan to provide one-off subsidies to enterprises that "keep their posts and leave their salaries" for migrant workers in key epidemic areas in accordance with a certain percentage of Wenzhou's monthly minimum wage standard. For the first time outside the city to warm employment employees, signed more than 1 year employment contract and pay social insurance in accordance with the law, according to the standard 1000 yuan per person to give a one-time subsidy.

Wenzhou has also put forward some solutions to the problem of small and micro enterprises'rewage quality. The core enterprises of the industrial chain, together with the supporting enterprises, pack up as a whole and apply to the competent departments for simultaneous filing and resuming work. The city has sorted out more than 1,000 supporting enterprises of over 500 million yuan, and all of them have resumed work.

In addition to the resumption of normal production and operation, Wenzhou hopes that the epidemic will become an opportunity for enterprise "machine replacement" and technological transformation. Wenzhou will increase the proportion of subsidies to enterprises for technical transformation projects by another 5 percentage points, and 20 per cent subsidies will be provided for projects with an investment of 5 million yuan or more within a year, with a maximum subsidy of 4 million yuan. Enterprises producing emergency materials will receive subsidies at 50 per cent of the actual amount of investment, up to $10 million.

In late February, the last patient in the ward was discharged from the hospital. In February, head nurse Jia Xiaohui went from zero to zero again.

On Feb. 29, the first time in four years, Jia and her colleagues said goodbye to all the new patients in the 17 wards. In March, her new assignment was to clean the ward thoroughly and then undergo 14 days of concentrated isolation. Jiangnan's spring is coming, the medical staff who have been fighting for many days can also have time to look out the window of the Green.

The number of mutations in the new coronavirus has increased to 149, and experts say it has not changed much recently
The director-general of WHO said that the transmission of NCP was less efficient than influenza and did not appear to be driven by people who did not have the disease. This means that the outbreak it causes can be contained. But the recent global spread of the epidemic, people from all walks of life remain deeply concerned.
Head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention: It is very difficult to avoid a global pandemic, and the response is imminent
In terms of trends, a new global pandemic of pneumonia may be inevitable, and China will need to do its part to deal with the new risks posed by the global epidemic while fighting its own internal interdiction.
The first autopsy report of a deceased patient with NCP was published to improve the clinical diagnosis and treatment of the patient
The autopsy of 11 patients with NCP has been completed. According to the first report, the presence of mucilage in the deep part of the lung is helpful for the decision-making of sputum-resolving and sputum-expelling schemes in clinical treatment.
New Coronaviruses may have appeared last November and mutations have been occurring, the study suggests
The new coronavirus has been mutating, and the researchers found it to be relatively mild so far. But given the severity of the current outbreak, sharing data about the virus could be even more helpful.

After the "effective medicine" came the "new Crown Vaccine" , word play or Rub hot?
The screening of drugs and vaccines, a much-anticipated event, also requires accurate information to reduce public misunderstanding.

28 days after the 730 million-dollar direct online reporting system for infectious diseases failed
After January 24,2020, the Infectious Disease Network direct report system is very important to report and summarize the information of epidemic situation in different places, and to prevent and control the epidemic situation as a whole, but still needs to further improve the reporting mechanism, the monitoring system is too complicated and so on.
From the cold bench to the spotlight, chloroquine and other "chicken ribs" medicine into the new scheme of diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia
ABIDOL and chloroquine phosphate are still needed to be tested in clinical trials for the treatment of new coronary pneumonia. Clinical trials of the drugs should continue even after the outbreak is over, to prevent a relapse.
Who was the first person to be genetically tested for new coronavirus pneumonia?
After the first "unclassified coronavirus" was detected by a third-party testing agency, the hospital was informed only by telephone. Three days later, the second case report read "SARS coronavirus. ". No one thought at the time that it was a COVID-19 attack.
Two new cases of coronary pneumonia with pathology results are available, and the autopsy is still under way
Researchers are trying to reveal the pathogenicity and lethality of the new coronavirus and provide new evidence for clinical treatment. The phase result is that the pathogenicity of the new coronavirus is similar to SARS, and the further result may be revealed by dissection.

Analysis of 70,000 new coronary disease cases: crude case-fatality rate 2.3% 
So far, there is no evidence of a superspreader event like the SARS outbreak, but the exact cause of the infection and the failure to prevent remains to be investigated.

Saving Wuhan: The most difficult three weeks after the city's closure
A mega-city of more than 10m people went into shock after a sudden outbreak of plague, and then struggled out of the chaos without hope.

From the lab to the ward, stop the new coronavirus
The tracing of the virus, the route of transmission from animal to human, and the mode of transmission from human to human are still in progress, and the development and validation of anti-viral vaccines and specific drugs are just beginning.
Doctors and nurses in Hubei face the toughest month as infections mount
Unknown to the virus, lack of medical supplies, but also because of high-intensity work pressure to affect immunity, leading to the peak of medical infection. With the enhancement of the awareness and knowledge of virus, the relative protective measures are put in place, fewer and fewer medical staff should be infected in the later period.

The number of mutations in the new coronavirus has increased to 149, and experts say it has not changed much recently

The director-general of WHO said that the transmission of NCP was less efficient than influenza and did not appear to be driven by people who did not have the disease. This means that the outbreak it causes can be contained. But the recent global spread of the epidemic, people from all walks of life remain deeply concerned.

Head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention: It is very difficult to avoid a global pandemic, and the response is imminent

In terms of trends, a new global pandemic of pneumonia may be inevitable, and China will need to do its part to deal with the new risks posed by the global epidemic while fighting its own internal interdiction.

The first autopsy report of a deceased patient with NCP was published to improve the clinical diagnosis and treatment of the patient

The autopsy of 11 patients with NCP has been completed. According to the first report, the presence of mucilage in the deep part of the lung is helpful for the decision-making of sputum-resolving and sputum-expelling schemes in clinical treatment.

New Coronaviruses may have appeared last November and mutations have been occurring, the study suggests

The new coronavirus has been mutating, and the researchers found it to be relatively mild so far. But given the severity of the current outbreak, sharing data about the virus could be even more helpful.

After the "effective medicine" came the "new Crown Vaccine" , word play or Rub hot?

The screening of drugs and vaccines, a much-anticipated event, also requires accurate information to reduce public misunderstanding.

28 days after the 730 million-dollar direct online reporting system for infectious diseases failed

After January 24,2020, the Infectious Disease Network direct report system is very important to report and summarize the information of epidemic situation in different places, and to prevent and control the epidemic situation as a whole, but still needs to further improve the reporting mechanism, the monitoring system is too complicated and so on.

From the cold bench to the spotlight, chloroquine and other "chicken ribs" medicine into the new scheme of diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia

ABIDOL and chloroquine phosphate are still needed to be tested in clinical trials for the treatment of new coronary pneumonia. Clinical trials of the drugs should continue even after the outbreak is over, to prevent a relapse.

Who was the first person to be genetically tested for new coronavirus pneumonia?

After the first "unclassified coronavirus" was detected by a third-party testing agency, the hospital was informed only by telephone. Three days later, the second case report read "SARS coronavirus. ". No one thought at the time that it was a COVID-19 attack.

Two new cases of coronary pneumonia with pathology results are available, and the autopsy is still under way

Researchers are trying to reveal the pathogenicity and lethality of the new coronavirus and provide new evidence for clinical treatment. The phase result is that the pathogenicity of the new coronavirus is similar to SARS, and the further result may be revealed by dissection.

Analysis of 70,000 new coronary disease cases: crude case-fatality rate 2.3% 

So far, there is no evidence of a superspreader event like the SARS outbreak, but the exact cause of the infection and the failure to prevent remains to be investigated.

Saving Wuhan: The most difficult three weeks after the city's closure

A mega-city of more than 10m people went into shock after a sudden outbreak of plague, and then struggled out of the chaos without hope.

From the lab to the ward, stop the new coronavirus

The tracing of the virus, the route of transmission from animal to human, and the mode of transmission from human to human are still in progress, and the development and validation of anti-viral vaccines and specific drugs are just beginning.

Doctors and nurses in Hubei face the toughest month as infections mount

Unknown to the virus, lack of medical supplies, but also because of high-intensity work pressure to affect immunity, leading to the peak of medical infection. With the enhancement of the awareness and knowledge of virus, the relative protective measures are put in place, fewer and fewer medical staff should be infected in the later period.
