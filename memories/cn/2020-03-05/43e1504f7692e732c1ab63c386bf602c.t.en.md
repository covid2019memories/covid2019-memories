January 21: Masks are no longer available

My name is Feng Xiang. I'm 55 years old. I'm from Wuhan. I'm practically born and raised here. He's a musician, a music therapist, and a psychiatrist.

People know me, probably because I wrote a song, "Hanyang Gate Garden" . Write his childhood the happiest of that time, Winter Wintersweet, summer pomegranate flower.

In January, news spread in Wuhan of pneumonia of unknown origin. Around January 10th, everybody knew about it, everybody knew about it, just didn't know what it was. You know it's a new coronavirus, but it's hard to tell what it is. How? I don't know. So that's why there are so many infections. Like I was a medical student, so I knew that respiratory disease had to wear a mask when he went out, and I went and bought a mask.

The most important part of my day job is doing music therapy at the mental hospital.

On the 21st (years ago) , I went to the ward for my last music therapy. At that time, I was still thinking of the New Year. There was a show in the ward, but everyone was wearing masks.

I was actually wearing a mask when I was outside, but I left it in the car when I went to my room for treatment. Up there, the matron gave me a mask, and said, "put your mask on, put your mask on, " as if you were aware of the severity of it by then.

When I left, the head nurse asked me, do you have a mask? If you don't have a mask, take a few. And I said, that's okay. I'll go out and get it. You can keep it.

But by the time I went out to buy masks, there was no more, there was nothing, there was no fabric masks.

Two days later, I called the head nurse, and I said, "you should be off soon, too. " She said we would be off soon, and the patients had gone home. I said, "do you have any more masks? Can you spare some? You said You'd give me some last time. " The head nurse told me the hospital was short of masks.

I was really, really nervous at the time.

Because psychiatry is a specialized hospital, it is only for mental illness, for other (disease) , especially epidemic prevention capacity is very weak. The group of patients were confined to a room with the central heating on in the winter. There was no way to check on a new patient for any other illness, and the first thing to do was to admit him, and then the paramedics didn't have masks, which was scary. I was a little nervous, and I said to the head nurse, "YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL! "

January 24: The supermarket is empty

In fact, since we got back on the 21st, my whole family's been in quarantine. Almost all respiratory infections can have an incubation period, the incubation period does not know how long, and the person you encounter a fever you do not know, this matter is more serious. So we isolated ourselves and waited for news.
Closing the city on the 23rd because the most effective way to fight all infectious diseases, especially respiratory infections, is to reduce or stop the movement of people, which is brutal, but it works.
At that time, we chat in the group when all say, why not block? I'm sure it would be most effective if we sealed off the neighborhood.
But the community is not closed (closed) , fortunately not closed, because my family did not eat! No food, no rice. I have to go out shopping.
On the 24th, I went out and found in the supermarket nearby that the vegetables were gone and the noodles were gone. I'm surprised we don't have noodles when we have rice. Then I went to a supermarket far away, and there was, I bought a lot of food, I bought a lot of rice. Then I found my father-in-law and moved all the things he had prepared for the New Year to my house. I felt much better and could last for a while.
The thing we worry about most is not ourselves. Adults can live with what they want. I worry about children. In case the child is put out of work, I said the work should be done well.
And the kids were amazing. A boy and a girl, older 10 years, younger 1 year 9 months, no request to go out. The older child was 10 years old and she knew how serious it was, and the younger child didn't know how serious it was, but when she saw that the adult didn't go out and stayed at home every day, he probably thought it was fine, just happy to look down at the dogs and cats at the window.

January 31: Watching old classmates on TV

Our classmates in the group is talking about these things, (we) are all doctors, will see a lot of positive energy, negative energy in the explosion.
The President of the hospital Zhang Dingyu is my classmate, (he is) especially steadfast such a person, school is that kind of quiet, especially honest (person) . The first time he appeared on television, we were shocked, I was watching his heart "clomp" for a while, is to see him walking is not very convenient, a limp. We were all in the same class, and I said, "what's going on? "? They said he had als. His wife was sick, too. It was hard for me. He really can only sleep two or three hours a day, and sometimes he can't sleep all night. Because of the sudden increase in the number of patients, the original isolation ward was too small, some wards had to be renovated, and he was doing all the work.
And then the whole group of us just kept talking about it. The first time a group of students in the hair, which is said to be a hospital nurse collapsed, later confirmed that it is false.
I would understand if no one was talking and just saw the scene. Because we (first-line) among the students said that every day fever clinic line up thousands of people move.
It was the common cold and the flu and this and other respiratory disease... and I thought to myself, how dangerous it is! People who catch a cold don't breathe very well, and a lot of people don't wear masks at the time.
But, I can't help it. It's been a stressful time.
Wuhan so many hospitals, infectious disease ward how many, the calculation can be extrapolated, the top day a hospital can isolate the number of beds, 200, this has reached the end.
Fever clinic every day is very large, huge, outpatient doctors can not leave work.
There have been deaths. This thing took all the eyeballs, all the rumors. Someone called me and asked me if many people had died in Wuhan. Rumors were spreading everywhere, and I felt powerless.
If you take a word to describe the mood of those days, it is really sad. Even the Union hospital is directly to the community for help, "no protective supplies" , all the hospitals have no protective supplies, you will feel sad.
And then those relationships are believed, and you feel bad. And you have to understand them, because when you're really scared, you have to take your anger and you have to overcome it. That's how helpless everyone is in the midst of that disaster.

"It's not common sense that matters most, it's emotion. "

"It's not common sense that matters most, it's emotion. "

I really think if I was still a doctor, I could do something on the front lines, maybe I'd be better. I'm at home right now, watching everything that's going on, and there's nothing I can do, and I can't do anything, and I'm in a really bad mood.

And then I thought, we've done a great job of making sure that we don't get infected, that we don't get infected, that we don't get infected, that we don't get infected, that we don't get infected, that we don't get infected, that we do a great job of making sure that we don't get infected, that we do a great job of making sure that we don't get infected. Because we're not going to bother you. I'm a little calmer now that I think about it.

These days, it's not common sense that matters most, it's emotion.

He wanted to express and release some of the feelings that had been pent up in his mind. It's better to find something to scold and then get comfortable. As to whether the matter is right or not, his main aim is to be able to vent his feelings.

Including what happened with the paper. I mean, do we have to go to science? With a pandemic like this, you have to publish this paper, even if you don't know anything yet, even if I haven't seen what this virus looks like.

Later, I simply do not see, the original also to refute two, later also do not bother to refute, unless stimulate my bottom line. For example, when I forwarded an interview with Zhang Dingyu, one person said that because he was a doctor, he could resign if he didn't want to. That's the kind of thing I would say to him, and then black him out.

I wanted to do something at home, I wanted to do something with the music. And then I remembered, well, I'm in music therapy anyway, so I'm just going to go live, and I'm going to go live at 10:00, and I'm going to go at 11:30, and I want you to go to sleep after that.

Sing some songs like that, talk to people. After everyone listened to the lecture, the mood is a little bit better, the person relaxed, ran to sleep.

It wasn't just for the audience, it was for me, too, and I had to let my emotions out.

Sometimes I feel bored at home, I also picked up some things in epidemiology, also reviewed the high number, their home modeling.

"There's a lot of work going on in this hospital. "

It might have something to do with medical school, and I'm very sensitive about death, especially when it's not just one person.

I've been through the same thing, trying to save a patient, and I already know that it's GonNa be hard, but I'm gonNA keep trying. Because for the deceased, for his family, it's a terrible tragedy for everyone to go.

For doctors and nurses, it's a big deal when a person leaves in front of them. I can imagine what doctors and nurses on the front lines are going through, what the families of these patients are going through. For everyone, the sky is falling.

When someone's life slips through your fingers, you can't hold on to them... but you can't stop, you don't want to give up, and you can't let these people go.

I said "desperately" , not an adjective, the hospital is really desperate: protective equipment is not enough, someone with a folder to block the face, on the "spell" .

So when I saw the doctors and nurses coming to support me, I actually cried. Because I know that the doctors and nurses in Wuhan finally have someone to help, have help.

In fact, we are not prepared for this kind of epidemic, not China, not Wuhan, is the entire human race is not prepared. Just look at the protective supplies can see that Wuhan's consumption, basically is to quickly run out of all the reserves, and then wait for the factory production, factory a batch, consumption a batch. Tens of thousands of patients plus tens of thousands of medical staff, professional equipment how much. It's not just them. Ordinary people need it. It's not enough.

And can be engaged in Infectious Disease Department of the doctor is not many, other departments (medical staff) have some personal habits, touch the face, touch the nose, for many people is a habit, but will lead to their own infection.

That's why people panic, and fear, and anger, and the fundamental reason is that we have no physical or mental preparation for the outbreak, and we don't have it.

Now, if you push backwards, you know, if you don't do well in this area, if you don't do well in that area, these people are responsible, these people are responsible, you can push a lot of things backwards.

But in my heart, I tolerate those things, which is unfortunate for us, because we're not prepared, and no one is prepared, and it's possible to make mistakes like that, including some very serious ones.

"They don't need gas, they need company. "

In the music therapy class at the shelter hospital, their organizer called me up and said, "Dr. Feng, we're going to do a thing like this. Join US. " I said, "okay. ".
We just talked about what it was about, singing and talking, and that's about it. The doctor said, "write a song about our project. ".
I don't really want to write at this time because I don't think my thoughts are organized. But when he told me that he was taking the class for the patients and the staff at the shelter, it occurred to me that what people really need at times like this.
For example, what does a paramedic need most, is someone behind him to cheer him on? I don't think they need any more gas, they've filled up the tank, they've pushed themselves to the limit.
The doctors and nurses I know, they put their lives on the line, they don't care about anything else, what do you mean they put their lives on the line? There they are. I think they're heroes, he doesn't need you to stand behind him, I think they need you to understand and be there for them, to let them know that someone is standing behind him, that they will stand behind him at all times, to be there for them.
The biggest comfort to them is that the patients who are receiving their help are getting better one by one, one by one out of the hospital gate, this is the biggest comfort to them.
The same is true of the patients. The presence of a health care provider, on the one hand, can bring them treatment, but more importantly, it can also be a companion. That's what we need most, including those of us who are separated from each other at home, "I always have company, " so I wrote a song.
This song, I don't know what it's called, and it doesn't have a name now, but it already has a name, and I said at the beginning of the lecture why I wrote it, and then I sang it.
The song is still in production, and it's a lot of energy and it's free, and it's never been mentioned, it's never been mentioned. I guess they're busy tonight.

"mental health is going to have a lot to deal with. "

All of these disasters, all kinds of psychological problems, are inevitable.

It is a basic principle that psychological or mental problems directly related to the disaster can not be alleviated in a short period of time, until the whole epidemic starts to improve and then everyone will be better.

But it's not like there's no way to make yourself better.

One of the most common ways is to distract yourself, because the more anxious you are, the more I pay attention to (the news that makes it anxious. For example, if someone around us is contagious, I get nervous about when I'm going to be contagious, as if it's a sure thing.

Breaking this focus is a great way to do it, but sometimes it's hard to do it because someone close to you has to be able to talk him out of it.

Another way is to pick up old hobbies. For example, many people like singing, dancing, and painting, but for various reasons to give up, this time can pick up these interests. It is better when one is able to Channel One's emotions or negative emotions.

But the final solution to the problem depends on the whole epidemic starting to improve slowly.

This time, for some families, for some people -- including the medical staff -- it was unconscionable. They were so tired every day, they didn't have time to grieve. In the future, the whole mental health aspect will be faced with a lot of things, this matter, there will be a large number of people because of this matter (epidemic) appear all kinds of psychological problems.

After this time, people may not only be sad, but also guilty, which makes no sense. But he just felt guilty because he was still alive, and he felt sure that he could save the person he loved and loved by his side, but he couldn't.

It is a common reaction that he must blame himself for these things. When this happens, it's GonNa take some psychological help. I really hope I can be of more help to you after this matter is over.

"suddenly the city is quiet, the little corner is warm. "
The last time I went out, there was no one on the street, no car, and once in a while I saw a janitor.
In the supermarket, you see some people shopping there, when the check-out time, will talk to the salesperson a few days.
Found that everyone suddenly became very quiet, but coincidentally began to care about each other, everyone left when said, "take care. ".
You would think that this city would be quiet because of this disaster and think about what our city should be like. Before the things that look like scenery, how much meaning in the end, and everyone that kind of uneventful life, how valuable.
Including our community, the original two people pass by each other, basically there will be no communication. But now, even though there's not a lot of people in the whole neighborhood, when you get to the front door, the doorman will not only ask you, what do you do, are you going out, but also ask, is there anything that's not convenient right now? Can they help with that? You would think, because of an epidemic, that in a city that seems so cold, there are so many little corners where it's all warm.
In My (Wechat) group, there are a lot of volunteers out to help others drive.
I have a friend who is a member of the Hubei Provincial Charity Federation. He hasn't been working, so he's been volunteering. Back and forth a lot of times every day, run to the high-speed interface to take things to the hospital, so busy every day, and then put their own money out a lot for everyone to buy this or that, you do not usually see.
That includes standing in line at the supermarket, about five feet apart from each other. You feel like you're missing one thing in the process and need to leave. No one will rush you. No one will watch you because you're not cutting in line or pushing your stuff aside.
Like this today, today when I went out to get a delivery, the old people at the door would see me getting a delivery with diapers, and would ask, "is your milk powder enough? " Because everyone knows that milk powder is not easy to buy, and express delivery is not convenient, and tell me where I can buy baby formula, how I can buy food, and talk to me a lot. It's like, all of a sudden, these people are getting closer to each other.
In the past, the noisy city of Wuhan looked very lively. Music was playing in every big shopping mall. Everyone seemed to be in high spirits. But that kind of relationship between people, it's not as hot as the music in that scene, it's not about each other. Although the city is suddenly very cold, there is no music in the streets, there are few people and cars, but when you get to a corner, with others, suddenly find that it will warm up. I want this thing to stay.

"We are experiencing the unexpected, the unexpected, the unexpected, " is the The Unbearable Lightness of Being word to describe these days.
