2020.2.19

Tomorrow is the last day of the notice to resume work in Hubei Province. The headquarters issued the document of the start-up mobilization meeting. Hubei Province should not delay further. After being locked up for so many days, they were all suffering at home. Friends who had been quite calm before had become anxious. They kept relaying news to me, such as the plague of locusts, extreme weather, slow spring ploughing, and so on. They asked me to buy more grain, oil, rice and flour, and they organized a group purchase of armed merchants in their residential quarters, she and her boyfriend bought five portions of rice and corn oil, and said they would drive to their parents'house for supplies when the outbreak was over.

I think rice is as important to southerners as flour is to northerners. My friends circle many colleagues in Shanbei, at home in a panic, have started to do noodles, scallion oil cakes, steamed buns these pasta, look at the picture made well, steamed buns and steamed buns successfully rise (that is to say, the dough is soft and fluffy) , the noodles are also root and branch, match bashful son to have appetite very much. I do pasta is really rotten, as long as kneading dough do steamed bread, must not rise, dough into a dead, hard to chew, fortunately, we do not like to eat pasta, love white rice.

I forgot which podcast I was listening to, about the decline of Daqing, and I mentioned the rice in the northeast, if you want to eat the delicious rice in the northeast, you have to buy it in Shanghai, the local people in the northeast don't even eat the authentic rice, the real good rice has already arrived in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, because it costs more to sell. Northeast of the rice to eat a memorable, with soy sauce can directly eat two large bowl. One of my colleagues is from northeast China. Whenever I talk about the food in my hometown, I always bring up rice, frozen pear, frozen apple, pork in WOK and stewed in an iron pot. I was weird. I said my favorite northeast dish was sticky bean buns, and I looked up and saw the look of disgust in her eyes.

In the previous issue of the diary, the dessert blogger shared a piece of chocolate a day. Yesterday's update was too tempting, not technically chocolate, but a marshmallow called "rose wine" : as clear as amber, the lovely red also shows fragments of frozen petals... first a sour, sweet citrus, then a rose... a concept that congeals a hot Christmas wine into candy, wonderful... this fudge is made with citrus, red wine, rose, cinnamon, carnation, Vanilla, lemon, apple, everything smashed and cooked in red wine, the complexity is in direct proportion to the richness of the flavors."Just reading the words makes me salivate, as if I were tasting a wine-red marshmallow rose.

The blogger who loves dessert is gentle and romantic, loves to smile, smiles sweetly and soft, "originally thought makes the chocolate person romantic, actually is not, the romantic person does anything romantic" . I've always had a dream (I have a dream) to learn how to make dessert, and there's a documentary about how the hands that make bread have to be hot, and the hands that make dessert have to be cold, and my limbs are cold all the year round, so it's a good fit.

In fact, back to Wuhan isolation for more than 20 days, is also the cure of my alcohol addiction? ？? Originally every day to drink a few glasses, just back to Wuhan bought a few bottles online, after drinking has not bought a new, after all, eating is a problem, where there is excess physical strength to buy wine, at first also feel itchy in the heart, ? I have no desire to drink at all ？? But when this is over, I could really use a drink.

The issue of local residents eating meals seems to have become a hot topic of discussion these two days, despite repeated official requests for supply guarantees from Shangchao logistics and group buying by various community organizations. In fact, the issue of such rationing is also quite obvious; the management of old and loosely managed residential areas is lax, there is a shortage of staff to manage the community as a whole, and elderly people will not use their mobile phones to place orders for group purchases. For them, the only way to buy food is to go to a mass market or a nearby vegetable market, can't fill up send orders, our community would like to dough bread and hot dry flour, the former to 30, the latter to 50, the group shouted a few days did not become a group, either think too much to eat, or think the content is not their favorite.

In fact, our unit is also difficult to eat, this week after the resumption of work, the General Office issued a notice requiring everyone to wear masks to work all day; canteens can not be opened because of non-compliance with the requirements, their own solution to Brunch; the air conditioning is closed, wear more warm and thick clothes; Water dispensers serve no water, bring your own kettle to boil, take your temperature every morning and evening and sign a health pledge. Are hard-headed start, hard conditions also have no way, said it is allowed to bring food, but the unit does not have a microwave oven, and finally the number of people ordered by the departments, take in batches, eat in batches. The funny thing is, there used to be a lot of male colleagues to smoke in the corridor, now except the main door, all the side entrance are closed, "let colleagues endure, do not force the door out to smoke, really can not help but go to the first floor door. ".

It is said that because the unit with Wuhan Identity Card too many employees, in and out of the registration scared property, was the property report, to the point that the Hubei Employees Unified Work at home, do not go to the unit.

However, if the ban measures are not tough, it seems that there is no other solution. In the past, when the management was lax, there was always the phenomenon of people gathering together to seize vegetables. The large supermarkets secretly opened their doors to sell vegetables, and daily disinfection and hygiene were at least reassuring, small vendors and vegetable markets are difficult to meet the health standards, I saw several appeal for help, are the family of the elderly originally healthy, go to the market after the onset of illness.

Some people say that online shopping, at least I never succeeded in grabbing a box of horse, every day at 22:00 guarding the APP, just to pay the page crashed, and then refresh to become "delivery boy has been full" , the convenience stores in Meituan and ele.me are also often out of stock. The convenience stores in our neighborhood are not short of alcohol and beverages, and the rest are hard to buy. Even if you order and pay for it, you may not have a rider waiting for hours to pick up the order, finally, the business contact refund. I used to ask the delivery guy to run errands for me. The running fee started at 80, no one would accept less than 50. Now it's more strict. All supermarkets are not open to individuals. They only accept community group purchase orders. Even if you succeed in getting out of the neighborhood, you will not be able to buy anything.

Today, I saw some people posting on Weibo complaining about the poor quality of the vegetable set meal purchased by the group, and the vegetable sellers we contacted in our neighborhood were not up to par. The dishes we received had a kind of "others picked up the leftovers" silence. The leaves of the green vegetables were wrinkled and the turnips were bruised and bruised, the sole eggplant was squashed, the peppers had moth eaten mouths, the tomatoes were tiny, and the cucumbers were wilted and dehydrated. A whole bag of vegetables on the ground, how to look all aggrieved, usually also can buy 3050 yuan, now charge 100 yuan, rely on you have no choice, want to complain to bad reviews are unable to find a place.

The difficulty of buying food is just a small slice of the inconvenience of life: Cooking Ingredients, daily Shampoos, skin care products, Sanitary Napkins, baby formula diapers, school supplies, pet supplies... these groups can not and can not go out to buy, i just saw someone ask darling to drink milk powder, the family inventory is running short, only to ask the community with the mothers. In Our neighborhood, we were allowed to walk our dogs, and the security guards turned a blind eye, because some of the families had large dogs, and if they didn't go to the center of the street, they would have to dismantle their homes. They were not allowed to walk their dogs this week, and when they saw that they were directly persuaded to go home, they informed the residents that they were not allowed to go downstairs for anything important, a day or two can overcome, time grew adults children cats and dogs can not stand.

Here's an interesting question from Zhihu: After the new pneumonia epidemic ended, did the divorce rate go up or down? Yesterday I happened to read an analysis of the end of the epidemic divorce rate, about marriage and family, thousands of people have a thousand answers, I tend to be pessimistic about the rise, perhaps marriage is not so simple to divorce, the number of couples breaking up may increase.

Two of the most liked answers, one from an economic point of view, the most intuitive impact of the epidemic on both husband and wife income, and expectations for the future (but income increases and decreases also have two effects, falling incomes make people feel that the cost of living apart is higher, marriage can share the cost, similar to "group heating, " but income decreases, especially a significant decline in one party, the income gap widens, and will become intimate relationships in the disharmony factor, accelerate the break-up of marriage, high-income people who dislike low-income drag their leg, low-income people are unwilling to be despised and compared) ;

Another answer, from a psychological perspective, is that short-term end-of-life disasters (such as a terrorist earthquake) tend to make intimate relationships more secure, and people subconsciously seek attachment in the face of death; long-term disasters tend to expose and magnify problems in relationships, couples in a long-term high-pressure state, but not to see the rise of the head down, thus exacerbating the confrontation and contradictions.

Of course, whether you live in the same city or a different place, whether you have children, how many years you have been married, your education, and so on are all factors to consider when you break up.

The day before yesterday, I saw a video of the Gansu medical team forcibly shaving the heads of the girls. I was shaking with anger. In the video, I could not see that they had voluntarily shaved their heads, and they were extremely violent from beginning to end, what infuriated me most was when the barber handed the shaved head to the girls and showed them his hair. Girls are all crying eyes, face is full of reluctance and grievance, even some people said to wash the ground, "think immediately to go to Wuhan too excited, tears of joy. ". Shaving women's hair and stripping them of their external gender identity is a vicious form of humiliation, and the camera zooms in on them so that they are always watched and consumed.

Their tears and expressions of pain, the dramatic contradictions that intensely excite those who watch the video, are for some sympathetic, angry, unable to watch, for others stimulating, refreshing, and exciting. They do not want to promote the professionalism and dedication of women workers, and they do not want to admit that women are better at certain things. Instead, they use cameras and words to cut women's bodies, focus on the image of a woman as a mother, wife, and daughter in the family: A pregnant woman in October, a nurse who miscarries for 10 days, a shaved head support team, a female doctor who wants to marry her boyfriend and meet her husband... The audience always sees a part of the woman: a high, bulging belly, cut Hair, face crushed by a mask, skin-washed hands... it's hard for the audience to see a complete, upright woman.

The male perspective also presents all women with another dilemma: Why can't you get through nine months of pregnancy and go to work when 10 months pregnant women are at the Front? Abortion insist on 10 days to work, you abortion 20 days why to apply for rest? Women are more demanding, morally kidnapped, and forced to sacrifice what was once a voluntary sacrifice.

Women in society in the crack of survival, in extraordinary times to continue to "be willing" to go to the front, women through the consumption of their own bodies and lives, access to social praise and accolades, they did not want this useless praise and flowers, but in the moment of the camera to get up involuntarily, forced into this show, participate in the performance of the sad drama, and at the end must complete sublimation, sad tears squeezed into a happy smile.

As onlookers, we can only see the front-line women of the vague outline of their facial blank, can be easily daubed to modify, one woman down, then take another to fill the gap. In the flood of fighting against the epidemic, women once again become the male-dominated, collectivism sacrifice, dragged out when needed to exaggerate the solemn and stirring atmosphere, propagandizing the love of silence, damaging the image of [ silencing ] , they are ignored and hidden, for example, the normal menstrual period, such as the hospital construction broadcast also participated in the female workers, the former is considered dirty, the latter is not decent, not good-looking.

* As soon as I finished writing the above, I saw the Jinan Education Bureau calling on dual-income families with low-school-age children who have no one to look after them to apply to work units for in-home care.

Yesterday I happened to read an analysis of the end of the epidemic divorce rate, about marriage and family, thousands of people have a thousand answers, I tend to be pessimistic about the rise, perhaps marriage is not so simple to divorce, the number of couples breaking up may increase.

Two of the most liked answers, one from an economic point of view, the most intuitive impact of the epidemic on both husband and wife income, and expectations for the future (but income increases and decreases also have two effects, falling incomes make people feel that the cost of living apart is higher, marriage can share the cost, similar to "group heating, " but income decreases, especially a significant decline in one party, the income gap widens, and will become intimate relationships in the disharmony factor, accelerate the break-up of marriage, high-income people who dislike low-income drag their leg, low-income people are unwilling to be despised and compared) ;

Another answer, from a psychological perspective, is that short-term end-of-life disasters (such as a terrorist earthquake) tend to make intimate relationships more secure, and people subconsciously seek attachment in the face of death; long-term disasters tend to expose and magnify problems in relationships, couples in a long-term high-pressure state, but not to see the rise of the head down, thus exacerbating the confrontation and contradictions.

Of course, whether you live in the same city or a different place, whether you have children, how many years you have been married, your education, and so on are all factors to consider when you break up.

The day before yesterday, I saw a video of the Gansu medical team forcibly shaving the heads of the girls. I was shaking with anger. In the video, I could not see that they had voluntarily shaved their heads, and they were extremely violent from beginning to end, what infuriated me most was when the barber handed the shaved head to the girls and showed them his hair. Girls are all crying eyes, face is full of reluctance and grievance, even some people said to wash the ground, "think immediately to go to Wuhan too excited, tears of joy. ". Shaving women's hair and stripping them of their external gender identity is a vicious form of humiliation, and the camera zooms in on them so that they are always watched and consumed.

Their tears and expressions of pain, the dramatic contradictions that intensely excite those who watch the video, are for some sympathetic, angry, unable to watch, for others stimulating, refreshing, and exciting. They do not want to promote the professionalism and dedication of women workers, and they do not want to admit that women are better at certain things. Instead, they use cameras and words to cut women's bodies, focus on the image of a woman as a mother, wife, and daughter in the family: A pregnant woman in October, a nurse who miscarries for 10 days, a shaved head support team, a female doctor who wants to marry her boyfriend and meet her husband... The audience always sees a part of the woman: a high, bulging belly, cut Hair, face crushed by a mask, skin-washed hands... it's hard for the audience to see a complete, upright woman.

The male perspective also presents all women with another dilemma: Why can't you get through nine months of pregnancy and go to work when 10 months pregnant women are at the Front? Abortion insist on 10 days to work, you abortion 20 days why to apply for rest? Women are more demanding, morally kidnapped, and forced to sacrifice what was once a voluntary sacrifice.

Women in society in the crack of survival, in extraordinary times to continue to "be willing" to go to the front, women through the consumption of their own bodies and lives, access to social praise and accolades, they did not want this useless praise and flowers, but in the moment of the camera to get up involuntarily, forced into this show, participate in the performance of the sad drama, and at the end must complete sublimation, sad tears squeezed into a happy smile.

As onlookers, we can only see the front-line women of the vague outline of their facial blank, can be easily daubed to modify, one woman down, then take another to fill the gap. In the flood of fighting against the epidemic, women once again become the male-dominated, collectivism sacrifice, dragged out when needed to exaggerate the solemn and stirring atmosphere, propagandizing the love of silence, damaging the image of [ silencing ] , they are ignored and hidden, for example, the normal menstrual period, such as the hospital construction broadcast also participated in the female workers, the former is considered dirty, the latter is not decent, not good-looking.

* As soon as I finished writing the above, I saw the Jinan Education Bureau calling on dual-income families with low-school-age children who have no one to look after them to apply to work units for in-home care.
