"You take care of the patient, I'll take care of you. "
02:11 Xiaoyang

I've been with Raymond for almost eight years. He is to do public security work, often bring suspects to our general hospital physical examination, we are then met, and then together.

The first time I knew about Wuhan was through Douyin, when I saw my teachers and colleagues in Wuhan, wearing masks for a long time, working for a long time, and some even collapsed physically. Later, I learned that one of my classmates, because to support the fever clinic infection, let me very sad.

So I submitted a challenge to our hospital in the first place. I was one of the first to set out on New Year's Eve. But on December twenty-nine, the day I went to the morning shift, our department came to a patient, he is from Wuhan back, both lungs are white, very serious, need tracheal intubation.

Endotracheal intubation is a great threat to medical staff. In 2003, when we intubated a patient in SARS, a room full of medical staff could have collapsed. And we don't have a lot of people who know how to intubate, so we had to do it ourselves.

At that time, there were not enough protective articles. It happened that our leaders left the protective clothing of SARS in 2003, so we forced ourselves to wear the clothes of that year. No N95 mask, just wear two surgical masks, no active air shield, just wear goggles, try to protect themselves, to do tracheal intubation.

After we intubated the patient, we were all put under medical quarantine. But happily, on the second day of the Lunar New Year, the patient tested negative for both nucleic acids, and was ruled out in the current alert mode. After I regained my freedom, I called our leader again and asked to go to Wuhan again.

8:00 am on the 8th, I received a text message, said please prepare personal belongings, leaving in the afternoon. I told Raymond this morning when he got home. He turned over the weather forecast to see the weather in Wuhan, when it was raining in Wuhan, he drove me to the supermarket again, bought electric blankets and so on.

At the March ceremony, we renewed our pledge to join the Party and took another oath. Raymond was standing at the back of the crowd, taking pictures of me with his cell phone and looking at me. Many of his colleagues had loved ones to drop him off, but in a relationship like ours, he couldn't have come with them.

After the oath was taken, Raymond told me that he had put his things under our bus and the office had to leave early. The next thing I knew, his car was in front of the hospital. At this time I received a message, he said he was afraid to cry, first left.

Off The record, Raymond didn't want me to come. He told me that, in the grand scheme of things, he supported my coming. But no one wants to put their significant other in harm's way by closing the door and going back to their own little home.

I am now in charge of the critical care unit in this hospital, and the working environment is different from before. It's like wearing gloves. We need five layers. And gloves are often small, after putting on will often feel the hand is very painful. Two masks make breathing a luxury. It's like someone's covering your mouth. Can't breathe.

Xiaoyang took off his arm from his protective suit after work

That includes not being able to go to the bathroom for four hours at work because you have to take off your clothes and waste a protective device. So this time in Wuhan, I wear diapers for the first time, the First Time to learn to pee in diapers, the feeling is quite uncomfortable.

A few days ago during a rescue, because my movement is more violent, the back of the protective clothing burst. It was a chaotic situation, and the patient was so sick, there was no time to do anything. And there are very few Hazmat suits, so if you go out, it means someone else has to take your place. We had half an hour to go, so we decided to tape it up and go back to work.

It didn't seem like much at the time, but in retrospect it was a bit scary -- like what if there was something going on?

Most of our current communication with Raymond is via video chat, but not much. Because we work different hours. And with the video, he's GonNa ask a lot of questions, like how serious the patient is today, if anything happened, and you can't not tell him the truth, and you can't tell him the truth, and you can't tell him more. So a lot of time is first with his wechat text, and then to video chat.

I think same-sex relationships take a lot of the "normalcy" out of us, and a lot of the things that we should be able to do we often fail to do. For example, after I arrived in Wuhan, Raymond called me and said that all the colleagues of their loved ones working in the hospital had gone home for the holidays. On the one hand, they might be afraid of cross infection. On the other hand, they also saw that the medical staff would work very hard, ask them to balance the house.

So Raymond told me, half jokingly, that he was miserable, and that if we were a straight couple, he'd get the day off. I mean, he was joking, but I was pretty upset.

Raymond's cap on duty

The day the suit exploded, he sent me a photo. He was on duty at the Turnpike, and it was snowing, and the hat he was holding was covered in snow. I told him to wear warm clothes when it got cold, and then I went to work in the contaminated area. When I came out, he gave me a sentence: You Watch the patient, I watch your back.

I wasn't allowed to leave the house. I came out to my husband with my daughter
22:07 Shinichi Mama

My girl came out to me in March 2016. No, she didn't tell me directly. She told me about one of my better sisters, and then my friend called me. I was at a meeting in Taiyuan, and when I heard the news, it was like the sky fell from the sky: How could this happen in my life?

Can Not Accept at first, communicate with her on Qq, crackling to her type, insult her, what harsh words have been said. But the kids were more resistant to me then, and every interaction ended in tears. I was so angry that I blocked all her contact information, and left her to fend for herself.

Later, I found friends and relatives from the Internet, to join the QQ group, only to know that so many people with me have the same experience, communication with them, this began to slowly transform themselves. But at that time I painful process is still relatively long, at least half a year can not think of this thing, a cry.

Husband's occupation is a teacher, every time the daughter comes back, he is very busy, we have not found the right point to tell him. In fact, I hinted at him many times, I said the child has its own way, how she chose to let her own thing, we do not interfere too much. But because he didn't understand, he didn't understand what I was saying, and he didn't take it seriously.

As a result, this year's Spring Festival, the epidemic this bad thing, in our family has become a good thing.

Because of the epidemic, he had a free holiday and stayed home all day. One day he told me that I was doing ideological work with my daughter to help her find a mate, and she agreed. I was surprised, so I asked the girl what was going on, and she said that dad misunderstood.

I told you, why don't you and I just tell him, you know, it's not a good time, because there's nothing we can do because of the epidemic, so let's just get it over with.

On the morning of the fifth day, after breakfast, I called the children to the living room, a family of three sitting on the Sofa. Let me talk to my husband. Let me talk to you. Maybe the husband had a bad feeling at that time. He looked very serious.

Me and the girl were holding his hand, and I told him the baby was gay. The husband hears these three words, the tear immediately flowed out, I looked at in the mind also uncomfortable not to be able. The husband opens mouth to say, impossible, I do not accept, throw off the hand of both of us, went out.

I and the girl at home silly eyes, with him not back, how to say also ignore. Then I said to the girl, this time he just doesn't want to see you, we go out, make room for him. The girl and I went to the park to sit, I sent his father Wechat, he told me he went home, so we can rest assured.

In the evening, my daughter and I went to her grandmother's home for dinner. After dinner, I came back to see her father lying in bed.

Xinyi's mother communicates with her husband on Wechat

The first day was mainly about communicating with him on Wechat. I posted at that time, "One, the child is innocent and she doesn't want to be. Second, the child is no different from any other person except that he doesn't want to get married. He is just as good as anyone else. Third, there are difficulties in the face of a family, do not often do not eat, not only punish themselves and torture family members. The child does not force you to accept him right away, but please come back to eat on time, take medicine on time, rest on time, and don't mess up your routine, i'm not well. So I was afraid it might mess with his routine.

The next day, I knew he didn't want to see the baby, so I sent him away, and we communicated directly. By this time he was in a slightly better mood and asked me, have you seen the doctor for the baby? I said I did. It's natural. It's not like we can just look at it and change it. I also put a little pressure on him, said it was in his genes, if you want to trace the genes, the character of the child, most of you, ha ha.

And then he told me that he looked it up on the Internet, and the kid was innocent, and she wasn't going to change. I was half reassured by his words, or at least he basically agreed with it. He also read the article I wrote about coming out to his other children, including a case of a father in Shandong Province that touched him deeply.

Coming out stories pushed by PFLAG's public account

But at this point, he said it was still weird, saying he didn't think she was mine. I told him that she was your child, and that she had chosen to be different, a lesbian.

On the third day, I said to my husband, if you feel uncomfortable, and let the children continue to grandma home. Husband said, do not let her out, see her go the moment, I feel very sad. I said she's not going out. I'm going out. You two talk. The daughter also told her husband about her current life situation, the plans with her girlfriend, their relationship for nearly 10 years and so on.

Then my husband said, he also asked the children, say you think you happy? The Child said, Dad, I think I'm happy. My husband said, I can not go to destroy the happiness of others Ah, our life is not to make the children happy?

After such exchange, the husband in the mind is not completely put down, also basically accepted.

This is the stormy weather we've been through in three days. My plan was to make his suffering as short as possible, and I didn't want him to repeat it -- too painful, too long.

To get the medicine, I told my doctor back home that I was HIV positive
38:24 Blackie

I usually work in Wuhan, during the Spring Festival, I returned to my hometown, Jingzhou, has been staying.

I started treatment in about 2014, and it's been almost five years now. The last withdrawal was in December, about a year ago. Traditionally, we would go to the hospital a week or 15 days before we ran out of the medicine and pick it up once every three months, depending on how much we had.

Normally, if we're going out of town, we double up on the meds just in case. So if we're going by the usual standards, this time I've got a pretty good dose, because it's going to be a month. But I didn't expect to spend so much time at home because of the epidemic.

From the end of December, the whole city of Wuhan began to spread some news of the epidemic. But before Zhong Nanshan spoke, life in Wuhan was normal. After Zhong Nanshan spoke, the mood across Wuhan was very strange. The next day when you go out, you'll find that everyone is wearing a mask and is consciously keeping their distance.

We had the day off on January 22nd, the day I took the bus home. From the time I was in my hometown, you will find that Wuhan has already entered a very alert state. Whether you take the subway, the train, or the bus, your temperature will be checked and you will be wearing a mask when you leave or enter the station. You are not allowed to leave or enter the station without wearing a mask.

After arriving home in the evening, I received a message from my colleague in Wuhan: Wuhan decided to close the city at 12 o'clock that night.

Our village is the village on the second day of the New Year. Village cadres and party members began to guard all the junctions and main roads in the villages. From now on, the prevention and control measures will be more and more strict. Until now, the organization department in the village was not allowed to go out unless there were serious special circumstances such as illness.

By the time I got home 20 days or so, I realized that I might not be able to keep my medication until the outbreak was completely over. So I set about making some preparations to make sure that the drugs would keep up.

HIV infection is generally in the place of residence or residence where the drug, I was in Wuhan drug, so I first went to get in touch with Wuhan Disease Control. From there, I learned that I could get a month's supply of medicine at our local treatment center through a referral from the Wuhan CDC. Then I went to our local county CDC to confirm that they could supply me with drugs.

On January 26th China's antiviral drug issued a circular on guaranteeing free travel for people living with HIV in other places.

At this point, there's another, more important thing to do, and that's how to get the medicine. Judging by our local blockade, I wouldn't have been able to get out of the house without a special reason.

So I had to go to the township health center, our local epidemic prevention headquarters, and ask them for proof. But, because my grandfather was a doctor, 90% of the doctors in my village knew me. If I wanted a certificate from a village doctor, that meant I had to tell them about my condition.

At first I just told the doctor I had a chronic disease and needed to go into the city to get medicine. But the doctor for strictly control the number of travel considerations, and further pressed the reason, I had to tell the truth.

I hadn't come out to my family and told them I was sick, so I had to lie to them and tell them that I had a chronic sinus attack, that it was serious, and that I needed to get medicine before I left the house.

On the way to get my medicine, I went through nearly five checkpoints. Each time I have taken the initiative to show proof of travel, very smoothly through. In the process, I also found that there are a lot of people who did not prove to try to muddle through, but were blocked back.

The whole thing was handled quite smoothly, I did not have too big mood swings, only to find the hospital to help me open evidence, some internal fluctuations. I don't really mind people knowing about my condition, but it's hard for me to accept that my parents are being judged for it.

For now, it's just a matter of what happens next. To determine when to return to Wuhan, if the time will be extended, I may do the second step, try to get a second batch of drugs, to ensure that the amount of drugs to support the end of the road closure.

For the infected, I think the most important thing is identity, you have to accept where you are now, in the follow-up work and treatment will not feel very anxious. Many people may be in a state of ignorance, which is actually more terrible than getting sick.

When you have a deep understanding of what to do when you get sick, and how to treat it, you don't feel that your life is going to be very dark. And you feel like we're okay, like we can live like normal people, and it's not as bad as you think.

"You take care of the patient, I'll take care of you. "

02:11 Xiaoyang

I've been with Raymond for almost eight years. He is to do public security work, often bring suspects to our general hospital physical examination, we are then met, and then together.

The first time I knew about Wuhan was through Douyin, when I saw my teachers and colleagues in Wuhan, wearing masks for a long time, working for a long time, and some even collapsed physically. Later, I learned that one of my classmates, because to support the fever clinic infection, let me very sad.

So I submitted a challenge to our hospital in the first place. I was one of the first to set out on New Year's Eve. But on December twenty-nine, the day I went to the morning shift, our department came to a patient, he is from Wuhan back, both lungs are white, very serious, need tracheal intubation.

Endotracheal intubation is a great threat to medical staff. In 2003, when we intubated a patient in SARS, a room full of medical staff could have collapsed. And we don't have a lot of people who know how to intubate, so we had to do it ourselves.

At that time, there were not enough protective articles. It happened that our leaders left the protective clothing of SARS in 2003, so we forced ourselves to wear the clothes of that year. No N95 mask, just wear two surgical masks, no active air shield, just wear goggles, try to protect themselves, to do tracheal intubation.

After we intubated the patient, we were all put under medical quarantine. But happily, on the second day of the Lunar New Year, the patient tested negative for both nucleic acids, and was ruled out in the current alert mode. After I regained my freedom, I called our leader again and asked to go to Wuhan again.

8:00 am on the 8th, I received a text message, said please prepare personal belongings, leaving in the afternoon. I told Raymond this morning when he got home. He turned over the weather forecast to see the weather in Wuhan, when it was raining in Wuhan, he drove me to the supermarket again, bought electric blankets and so on.

At the March ceremony, we renewed our pledge to join the Party and took another oath. Raymond was standing at the back of the crowd, taking pictures of me with his cell phone and looking at me. Many of his colleagues had loved ones to drop him off, but in a relationship like ours, he couldn't have come with them.

After the oath was taken, Raymond told me that he had put his things under our bus and the office had to leave early. The next thing I knew, his car was in front of the hospital. At this time I received a message, he said he was afraid to cry, first left.

Off The record, Raymond didn't want me to come. He told me that, in the grand scheme of things, he supported my coming. But no one wants to put their significant other in harm's way by closing the door and going back to their own little home.

I am now in charge of the critical care unit in this hospital, and the working environment is different from before. It's like wearing gloves. We need five layers. And gloves are often small, after putting on will often feel the hand is very painful. Two masks make breathing a luxury. It's like someone's covering your mouth. Can't breathe.

Xiaoyang took off his arm from his protective suit after work

That includes not being able to go to the bathroom for four hours at work because you have to take off your clothes and waste a protective device. So this time in Wuhan, I wear diapers for the first time, the First Time to learn to pee in diapers, the feeling is quite uncomfortable.

A few days ago during a rescue, because my movement is more violent, the back of the protective clothing burst. It was a chaotic situation, and the patient was so sick, there was no time to do anything. And there are very few Hazmat suits, so if you go out, it means someone else has to take your place. We had half an hour to go, so we decided to tape it up and go back to work.

It didn't seem like much at the time, but in retrospect it was a bit scary -- like what if there was something going on?

Most of our current communication with Raymond is via video chat, but not much. Because we work different hours. And with the video, he's GonNa ask a lot of questions, like how serious the patient is today, if anything happened, and you can't not tell him the truth, and you can't tell him the truth, and you can't tell him more. So a lot of time is first with his wechat text, and then to video chat.

I think same-sex relationships take a lot of the "normalcy" out of us, and a lot of the things that we should be able to do we often fail to do. For example, after I arrived in Wuhan, Raymond called me and said that all the colleagues of their loved ones working in the hospital had gone home for the holidays. On the one hand, they might be afraid of cross infection. On the other hand, they also saw that the medical staff would work very hard, ask them to balance the house.

So Raymond told me, half jokingly, that he was miserable, and that if we were a straight couple, he'd get the day off. I mean, he was joking, but I was pretty upset.

Raymond's cap on duty

The day the suit exploded, he sent me a photo. He was on duty at the Turnpike, and it was snowing, and the hat he was holding was covered in snow. I told him to wear warm clothes when it got cold, and then I went to work in the contaminated area. When I came out, he gave me a sentence: You Watch the patient, I watch your back.

I wasn't allowed to leave the house. I came out to my husband with my daughter

22:07 Shinichi Mama

My girl came out to me in March 2016. No, she didn't tell me directly. She told me about one of my better sisters, and then my friend called me. I was at a meeting in Taiyuan, and when I heard the news, it was like the sky fell from the sky: How could this happen in my life?

Can Not Accept at first, communicate with her on Qq, crackling to her type, insult her, what harsh words have been said. But the kids were more resistant to me then, and every interaction ended in tears. I was so angry that I blocked all her contact information, and left her to fend for herself.

Later, I found friends and relatives from the Internet, to join the QQ group, only to know that so many people with me have the same experience, communication with them, this began to slowly transform themselves. But at that time I painful process is still relatively long, at least half a year can not think of this thing, a cry.

Husband's occupation is a teacher, every time the daughter comes back, he is very busy, we have not found the right point to tell him. In fact, I hinted at him many times, I said the child has its own way, how she chose to let her own thing, we do not interfere too much. But because he didn't understand, he didn't understand what I was saying, and he didn't take it seriously.

As a result, this year's Spring Festival, the epidemic this bad thing, in our family has become a good thing.

Because of the epidemic, he had a free holiday and stayed home all day. One day he told me that I was doing ideological work with my daughter to help her find a mate, and she agreed. I was surprised, so I asked the girl what was going on, and she said that dad misunderstood.

I told you, why don't you and I just tell him, you know, it's not a good time, because there's nothing we can do because of the epidemic, so let's just get it over with.

On the morning of the fifth day, after breakfast, I called the children to the living room, a family of three sitting on the Sofa. Let me talk to my husband. Let me talk to you. Maybe the husband had a bad feeling at that time. He looked very serious.

Me and the girl were holding his hand, and I told him the baby was gay. The husband hears these three words, the tear immediately flowed out, I looked at in the mind also uncomfortable not to be able. The husband opens mouth to say, impossible, I do not accept, throw off the hand of both of us, went out.

I and the girl at home silly eyes, with him not back, how to say also ignore. Then I said to the girl, this time he just doesn't want to see you, we go out, make room for him. The girl and I went to the park to sit, I sent his father Wechat, he told me he went home, so we can rest assured.

In the evening, my daughter and I went to her grandmother's home for dinner. After dinner, I came back to see her father lying in bed.

Xinyi's mother communicates with her husband on Wechat

The first day was mainly about communicating with him on Wechat. I posted at that time, "One, the child is innocent and she doesn't want to be. Second, the child is no different from any other person except that he doesn't want to get married. He is just as good as anyone else. Third, there are difficulties in the face of a family, do not often do not eat, not only punish themselves and torture family members. The child does not force you to accept him right away, but please come back to eat on time, take medicine on time, rest on time, and don't mess up your routine, i'm not well. So I was afraid it might mess with his routine.

The next day, I knew he didn't want to see the baby, so I sent him away, and we communicated directly. By this time he was in a slightly better mood and asked me, have you seen the doctor for the baby? I said I did. It's natural. It's not like we can just look at it and change it. I also put a little pressure on him, said it was in his genes, if you want to trace the genes, the character of the child, most of you, ha ha.

And then he told me that he looked it up on the Internet, and the kid was innocent, and she wasn't going to change. I was half reassured by his words, or at least he basically agreed with it. He also read the article I wrote about coming out to his other children, including a case of a father in Shandong Province that touched him deeply.

Coming out stories pushed by PFLAG's public account

But at this point, he said it was still weird, saying he didn't think she was mine. I told him that she was your child, and that she had chosen to be different, a lesbian.

On the third day, I said to my husband, if you feel uncomfortable, and let the children continue to grandma home. Husband said, do not let her out, see her go the moment, I feel very sad. I said she's not going out. I'm going out. You two talk. The daughter also told her husband about her current life situation, the plans with her girlfriend, their relationship for nearly 10 years and so on.

Then my husband said, he also asked the children, say you think you happy? The Child said, Dad, I think I'm happy. My husband said, I can not go to destroy the happiness of others Ah, our life is not to make the children happy?

After such exchange, the husband in the mind is not completely put down, also basically accepted.

This is the stormy weather we've been through in three days. My plan was to make his suffering as short as possible, and I didn't want him to repeat it -- too painful, too long.

Because of the epidemic, he had a free holiday and stayed home all day. One day he told me that I was doing ideological work with my daughter to help her find a mate, and she agreed. I was surprised, so I asked the girl what was going on, and she said that dad misunderstood.

I told you, why don't you and I just tell him, you know, it's not a good time, because there's nothing we can do because of the epidemic, so let's just get it over with.

On the morning of the fifth day, after breakfast, I called the children to the living room, a family of three sitting on the Sofa. Let me talk to my husband. Let me talk to you. Maybe the husband had a bad feeling at that time. He looked very serious.

Me and the girl were holding his hand, and I told him the baby was gay. The husband hears these three words, the tear immediately flowed out, I looked at in the mind also uncomfortable not to be able. The husband opens mouth to say, impossible, I do not accept, throw off the hand of both of us, went out.

I and the girl at home silly eyes, with him not back, how to say also ignore. Then I said to the girl, this time he just doesn't want to see you, we go out, make room for him. The girl and I went to the park to sit, I sent his father Wechat, he told me he went home, so we can rest assured.

In the evening, my daughter and I went to her grandmother's home for dinner. After dinner, I came back to see her father lying in bed.

Xinyi's mother communicates with her husband on Wechat

The first day was mainly about communicating with him on Wechat. I posted at that time, "One, the child is innocent and she doesn't want to be. Second, the child is no different from any other person except that he doesn't want to get married. He is just as good as anyone else. Third, there are difficulties in the face of a family, do not often do not eat, not only punish themselves and torture family members. The child does not force you to accept him right away, but please come back to eat on time, take medicine on time, rest on time, and don't mess up your routine, i'm not well. So I was afraid it might mess with his routine.

The next day, I knew he didn't want to see the baby, so I sent him away, and we communicated directly. By this time he was in a slightly better mood and asked me, have you seen the doctor for the baby? I said I did. It's natural. It's not like we can just look at it and change it. I also put a little pressure on him, said it was in his genes, if you want to trace the genes, the character of the child, most of you, ha ha.

And then he told me that he looked it up on the Internet, and the kid was innocent, and she wasn't going to change. I was half reassured by his words, or at least he basically agreed with it. He also read the article I wrote about coming out to his other children, including a case of a father in Shandong Province that touched him deeply.

Coming out stories pushed by PFLAG's public account

But at this point, he said it was still weird, saying he didn't think she was mine. I told him that she was your child, and that she had chosen to be different, a lesbian.

On the third day, I said to my husband, if you feel uncomfortable, and let the children continue to grandma home. Husband said, do not let her out, see her go the moment, I feel very sad. I said she's not going out. I'm going out. You two talk. The daughter also told her husband about her current life situation, the plans with her girlfriend, their relationship for nearly 10 years and so on.

Then my husband said, he also asked the children, say you think you happy? The Child said, Dad, I think I'm happy. My husband said, I can not go to destroy the happiness of others Ah, our life is not to make the children happy?

After such exchange, the husband in the mind is not completely put down, also basically accepted.

This is the stormy weather we've been through in three days. My plan was to make his suffering as short as possible, and I didn't want him to repeat it -- too painful, too long.

To get the medicine, I told my doctor back home that I was HIV positive

38:24 Blackie

I usually work in Wuhan, during the Spring Festival, I returned to my hometown, Jingzhou, has been staying.

I started treatment in about 2014, and it's been almost five years now. The last withdrawal was in December, about a year ago. Traditionally, we would go to the hospital a week or 15 days before we ran out of the medicine and pick it up once every three months, depending on how much we had.

Normally, if we're going out of town, we double up on the meds just in case. So if we're going by the usual standards, this time I've got a pretty good dose, because it's going to be a month. But I didn't expect to spend so much time at home because of the epidemic.

From the end of December, the whole city of Wuhan began to spread some news of the epidemic. But before Zhong Nanshan spoke, life in Wuhan was normal. After Zhong Nanshan spoke, the mood across Wuhan was very strange. The next day when you go out, you'll find that everyone is wearing a mask and is consciously keeping their distance.

We had the day off on January 22nd, the day I took the bus home. From the time I was in my hometown, you will find that Wuhan has already entered a very alert state. Whether you take the subway, the train, or the bus, your temperature will be checked and you will be wearing a mask when you leave or enter the station. You are not allowed to leave or enter the station without wearing a mask.

After arriving home in the evening, I received a message from my colleague in Wuhan: Wuhan decided to close the city at 12 o'clock that night.

Our village is the village on the second day of the New Year. Village cadres and party members began to guard all the junctions and main roads in the villages. From now on, the prevention and control measures will be more and more strict. Until now, the organization department in the village was not allowed to go out unless there were serious special circumstances such as illness.

By the time I got home 20 days or so, I realized that I might not be able to keep my medication until the outbreak was completely over. So I set about making some preparations to make sure that the drugs would keep up.

HIV infection is generally in the place of residence or residence where the drug, I was in Wuhan drug, so I first went to get in touch with Wuhan Disease Control. From there, I learned that I could get a month's supply of medicine at our local treatment center through a referral from the Wuhan CDC. Then I went to our local county CDC to confirm that they could supply me with drugs.

On January 26th China's antiviral drug issued a circular on guaranteeing free travel for people living with HIV in other places.

At this point, there's another, more important thing to do, and that's how to get the medicine. Judging by our local blockade, I wouldn't have been able to get out of the house without a special reason.

So I had to go to the township health center, our local epidemic prevention headquarters, and ask them for proof. But, because my grandfather was a doctor, 90% of the doctors in my village knew me. If I wanted a certificate from a village doctor, that meant I had to tell them about my condition.

At first I just told the doctor I had a chronic disease and needed to go into the city to get medicine. But the doctor for strictly control the number of travel considerations, and further pressed the reason, I had to tell the truth.

I hadn't come out to my family and told them I was sick, so I had to lie to them and tell them that I had a chronic sinus attack, that it was serious, and that I needed to get medicine before I left the house.

On the way to get my medicine, I went through nearly five checkpoints. Each time I have taken the initiative to show proof of travel, very smoothly through. In the process, I also found that there are a lot of people who did not prove to try to muddle through, but were blocked back.

The whole thing was handled quite smoothly, I did not have too big mood swings, only to find the hospital to help me open evidence, some internal fluctuations. I don't really mind people knowing about my condition, but it's hard for me to accept that my parents are being judged for it.

For now, it's just a matter of what happens next. To determine when to return to Wuhan, if the time will be extended, I may do the second step, try to get a second batch of drugs, to ensure that the amount of drugs to support the end of the road closure.

For the infected, I think the most important thing is identity, you have to accept where you are now, in the follow-up work and treatment will not feel very anxious. Many people may be in a state of ignorance, which is actually more terrible than getting sick.

When you have a deep understanding of what to do when you get sick, and how to treat it, you don't feel that your life is going to be very dark. And you feel like we're okay, like we can live like normal people, and it's not as bad as you think.

On January 26th China's antiviral drug issued a circular on guaranteeing free travel for people living with HIV in other places.

At this point, there's another, more important thing to do, and that's how to get the medicine. Judging by our local blockade, I wouldn't have been able to get out of the house without a special reason.

So I had to go to the township health center, our local epidemic prevention headquarters, and ask them for proof. But, because my grandfather was a doctor, 90% of the doctors in my village knew me. If I wanted a certificate from a village doctor, that meant I had to tell them about my condition.

At first I just told the doctor I had a chronic disease and needed to go into the city to get medicine. But the doctor for strictly control the number of travel considerations, and further pressed the reason, I had to tell the truth.

I hadn't come out to my family and told them I was sick, so I had to lie to them and tell them that I had a chronic sinus attack, that it was serious, and that I needed to get medicine before I left the house.

On the way to get my medicine, I went through nearly five checkpoints. Each time I have taken the initiative to show proof of travel, very smoothly through. In the process, I also found that there are a lot of people who did not prove to try to muddle through, but were blocked back.

The whole thing was handled quite smoothly, I did not have too big mood swings, only to find the hospital to help me open evidence, some internal fluctuations. I don't really mind people knowing about my condition, but it's hard for me to accept that my parents are being judged for it.

For now, it's just a matter of what happens next. To determine when to return to Wuhan, if the time will be extended, I may do the second step, try to get a second batch of drugs, to ensure that the amount of drugs to support the end of the road closure.

For the infected, I think the most important thing is identity, you have to accept where you are now, in the follow-up work and treatment will not feel very anxious. Many people may be in a state of ignorance, which is actually more terrible than getting sick.

When you have a deep understanding of what to do when you get sick, and how to treat it, you don't feel that your life is going to be very dark. And you feel like we're okay, like we can live like normal people, and it's not as bad as you think.
