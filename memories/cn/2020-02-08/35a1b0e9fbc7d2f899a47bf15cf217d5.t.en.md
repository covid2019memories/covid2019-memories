The 436th story of the plan for all the people --

One

February 5th, 2020, the fifth day of my isolation.

If I'm lucky for the next nine days, I can get out of here.

My name is Yueh Sze, and I'm one of the 180,000 people in close contact who have been quarantined. The probability is very small, these days, I have been replaying the scene of that day, every detail will confirm with their own. As if in the dark, I was destined to get on the bus with the "confirmed patient" .

On January 18th, two days before the new pneumonia was taken seriously, I flew straight from school to Shanghai, intending to spend a few days in Shanghai before returning home. We went to the crowded pedestrian streets of Nanjing Road and the Bund, where no one wore a mask.

I decided to return early on the spur of the moment because my schedule was not well arranged. At 10 a.m. , Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station, more than 1,000 kilometers from Hubei Province, was packed with people who knew little about the coming epidemic, and enthusiasm for returning home was as strong as ever.

At three o'clock in the afternoon, I rolled all the way to the home station, just out of the station, the first sight of the bus to grandma's home. Small bus, no restrictions on passengers to speak of, sit as many as possible, the car has been crowded with people, I still hesitate to get on the bus, but the passengers pushed me.

After getting in the car, I sent my mother a screenshot of what I had seen on Weibo, telling her that I was on my way home and that the pneumonia was really bad. My mother replied, "stay at home and be safe. ".

After 20 minutes, the bus stopped at the entrance of the village. My father cased the place and came to take my luggage, as he walked, he told me his plans for the Spring Festival. "Tomorrow is your grandmother's 70th birthday. On the second day of the first lunar month, we will go to her house to pay New Year's greetings. On the third day of the first lunar month, we will celebrate my aunt's 80th birthday. On the sixth lunar month, we will offer sacrifices to our ancestors and have a feast. " I began to worry about how to deal with the relatives, did not consider to let parents stay at home.

At night, my mother and I crowded in a bed, a quilt. Maybe because we were under different blankets, my mother was able to end her isolation days earlier than I did.

Two

The next day, at nine o'clock in the morning, my parents and I were going to the market to buy vegetables. The News of the new coronavirus has hit Weibo, and the food market reminds me of the south China Seafood Market.

I had the good fortune to check that the virus was suspected of being transmitted through wild animals, and the market in my hometown never sold game. After a bit of a struggle, I went out.

The market was so busy that each of us had our hands full of seafood and vegetables that we ended up having to call a trampoline.

After lunch at Grandma's house, my parents and I set off for Grandma's house. Relatives come and go, and the Spring Festival presents keep on flowing. At 8:00 p.m. , we finally had dinner. There are eight tables, each table can seat ten people, but the guests still can't sit down. It took nearly two hours for the party to break up.

What we didn't know at the time was that after the Sleeper Cell, there would be a long silence.

The balcony of my grandmother's house on a Sunny Day

One after another on the wechat group, I began to realize that this epidemic is not optimistic: Roommate a said her small county everyone put on masks; roommate B said Shanghai has become an empty city, there are no cars on the road; Several other roommates have also heard the news of the "fall" of their hometown.

Until January 23rd, when the city of Wuhan was closed. Dad was getting word that the dinner had been canceled. We still eat our New Year's Eve dinner as usual. Dad Rarely Cook, do more than a dozen dishes, my uncle posted the Spring Festival couplets, I stood outside looking in a daze, finally have a little New Year's atmosphere.

Not long after sitting down, the head of the village came to our house with a form, asking my parents and I to register the place of origin and telephone. My father muttered: "How to make it like SARS that year" .

During dinner, aunt seems to have a cold, the voice is Hoarse, I am very nervous, and not good to show. My uncle left after dinner. My parents were busy with washing and washing. I was in no mood to watch the Spring Festival gala. I continued to brush up on the news related to the epidemic on Weibo and immersed myself in it unconsciously.

It wasn't until the fireworks went off outside that I realized it was New Year's Eve.

Three

On the first day of the Lunar New Year, at eight in the morning, I was awakened by the sound of the village trumpets to warn me of the epidemic. The broadcast was repeated in Mandarin, followed by the local dialect, and played in a loop for half an hour.

Down the stairs, my mother told me that the village was closed to all traffic and people. My father had planned to go back to work on the Eleventh Day of the first lunar month, but he decided to return to work on the seventh day of the Lunar New Year because the epidemic was so serious that he was afraid the transportation would be stopped by then.

My Dad's concerns were not misplaced, because two days later, we canceled multiple bullet trains and flights, and closed off multiple highway exits. Like Wuhan, the city was sealed off.

At noon, my mother and I walked my father to the train station. All three of us were wearing KN90 masks that GRANDPA had fought so hard to get, and we were afraid to take the bus, so we finally got a taxi to the train station. I had never seen such an empty ticket hall. Everyone was wearing masks, and two staff members in protective suits were taking the temperature of everyone who came into the station.

After leaving the station, my mother and I are going to take a taxi to the supermarket in town to buy supplies. And that's when I got a call. The other side said: "One of your classmates was diagnosed, you and Ta close contact, I am now at your grandma's house, where are you? "

My first reaction was that it should be a fraudulent phone call. How could it be possible? But I was still scared to stand still and my heart almost jumped out of my chest.

After hanging up, my mother and I gave up shopping and went straight to my grandmother's house.

Four

From the village to Grandma's home is a distance, usually walk to ten minutes, that day I feel that the road is very long, as if the end. Because I don't know what's waiting for me on the other side of the road.

When we were almost there, my mother and I found the village chief and two police officers wearing masks waiting at the entrance of the village. When we got closer, the village chief signaled us to keep a distance of three or four meters from them. The police stood at a distance, started asking me where I started, what kind of transportation I took.

My mother in the side excitedly asked them "who is infected, " the village chief and the two police can not say clearly. They left without even taking their temperature.

When they left, I was relieved that it was no big deal.

When grandma saw the village chief and his party leaving, she dared to open the door for us. She's never worn a mask before, and she's wearing one now. The Grandmother said, half an hour ago, the village chief brought someone to the house, gave her a mask, said I am close contacts, the family must wear masks, and the next few days, the family must take temperature.

A neighbor heard the news, and by the time my mother and I got home, word had gotten out in the village that my school boyfriend had contracted Covid-19, and that he had passed it on to me. I was angry and funny, single for 20 years, and now I have a boyfriend out of thin air.

My mother was so mad at these rumors, that someone called me out of the blue and told me that there was a confirmed patient on the bus I was coming back on, that I needed to be quarantined, put under medical observation for four days, and the bus was coming, let me just get some clothes.

When I heard the news, I didn't panic so much. I asked my mother to help me pack up. My grandmother cried when she heard that I was being quarantined. This is the first time since I was a kid. When my mother saw her grandmother crying, she was so angry and angry that tears came into her eyes. She asked me in an almost supplicating tone, "can we not go? Can we just stay at home and don't go anywhere and take our temperature every day? "

I comforted her by saying, "it's for our own good to be in quarantine, otherwise everyone around us would be in a panic. " My mother added, "If you get pulled away, it's hard to say what will happen. "

I was Speechless (TV series) to find clothes, and my mother was helpless to help me pack.

The car soon arrived, I carry a suitcase out of the door of the moment, there was a kind of "heroic death" illusion. On the bus, my mother banged on the dark windows, afraid I do not remember the hotel address to her, as if I go this, will not come back.

The driver, a doctor in a Hazmat suit, took me to a third floor room and took my temperature.

After settling down, I busied myself with news of my family, friends, and epidemic prevention staff. It wasn't until 10 p.m. that the phones finally quieted down. I thought tonight was going to be a sleepless night, but no amount of fear or worry can stop me from falling asleep. It didn't take long for me to fall asleep.

Five

February 1st, the first day of my quarantine. I woke up at seven in the morning. I couldn't sleep well. I woke up several times in the evening.

As of 2400 hours on 31 January, in addition to the tens of thousands of confirmed cases, there were 118478 close contacts under medical observation.

It made me feel unreal. Yesterday, those one hundred and ten thousand people were just a statistic in the news to me. Now I'm just another statistic in the news.

9:20, armed aunt sent a few small steamed bread, has been cold, let me eat quickly. She changed all the four-piece sets on the bed. Someone came to take my temperature and I was slightly relieved to hear her say "35.2" .

After ten o'clock, my aunt called. My mother asked her to give my uncle the change of clothes. My uncle also bought some food and daily necessities and sent them to me.

When I first got the notice, I said I just needed to be quarantined for four days, packed up some clothes and left in a hurry. Now they're saying I need to be in quarantine for 14 days.

Lunch at noon | by the author

At 11:30, the aunt sent over lunch, meat and vegetable collocation, the taste is still delicious, listen to the aunt said that these meals are free. After lunch, I got a message from my supervisor asking if I needed a mask.

I still have 5 KN90 masks in my suitcase. I wanted to decline, but the supervisor said she had already bought some masks from the Japanese agency and sent them to me, and Comfort me: "You do not fear, you have a college behind you, there is a school, difficult times, I can do so much. " Listen to her finish, I was touched.

In the afternoon, people from the village called me out of the blue to tell me that my mother was being quarantined, too.

They told me that because my mother and I had been in close contact, she had not been put on the Medical Watch list last night and decided to put her in isolation today. The icy tone, as if it meant giving away an object.

If my mother had stayed outside, I would have felt less alone, but now she's inside, too. She's probably more scared than I am, and I felt that last night.

I want to wail, but the hotel sound insulation effect is not good, for fear of being heard unnecessary misunderstanding, had to suppress their cries, silent tears.

Crying for a long time, I comfort myself to cheer up, Father Far Away from the province, mother only I can rely on, think of this, my mood calmed a bit, gradually stopped the tears.

February 2,2020, the day after I was quarantined, the day after my mother was quarantined.

My mother told me that the quilt in the hotel she stayed in was too thin, and she was freezing to sleep last night. I know mom will be cold stomach will be very uncomfortable, and worried about her cold.

Mother said she had eaten four small buns for breakfast. She was hungry and had nothing else to eat.

I love my mother, and there is no way, if my mother caught a cold, will be sent to the hospital, may cross infection; if my mother is now infected what to do, originally nothing, now because I was isolated, but something. The more I thought about these things, the more frightened I became, and I began to shudder.

I live in this isolation point more than 30 people, because of something that day, the accumulation of negative feelings in the wechat group broke out once. Out of quarantine, the new delivery man left dinner on the floor last night, but did not knock, and some of the food was cold.

A said that putting food on the ground was like feeding an animal, without dignity; b said that he had a bad stomach and was sick after eating cold food; C said that the ground was not clean and could not be used for food; D brought a two-week-old baby with him, and the baby could not eat the food, and the child's mask is all wet and soft, no one to send new; E's father has rheumatism, only a quilt, so cold can not sleep.

There was a request for quilts in the group, and no one responded. As for me, the two days did not get the garbage bag, in the face of these needs, it seems to be nothing.

Fortunately, as of February 3,14 days into my contact with the "confirmed patient, " I had no symptoms, and the rest of the people at this quarantine point were fine.

In the afternoon, I finally heard a good news, mother ended isolation period, out.

When my mother came home, the village head with someone on duty at the entrance to the village, see my mother back so early, they are also surprised, sprayed a layer of disinfectant on her body, finally let her go.

In the evening, I began to worry again. I asked the staff on the wechat group when I would be allowed to go out. The answer was: 14 days from the day I checked in.

The paramedics said they'd adjust the time, based on what they saw, until the 14th at the latest. Just this "14" days, over and over again, do not know how many reincarnation. I just hope those 180,000 close contacts were a false alarm.
