##Diary of the siege of Wuhan | Day 17

Techread

Features, Lanxi, founder of zhulu.com  , focuses on in-depth observations and business reviews of Internet startups, new media, and subcultures.

See someone private letter I said Fried Egg station chief (long-lived in Wuhan) is also suspected of new pneumonia is asking for help, updated the timeline, found that it seems to rule out again, just because of other illness physical discomfort.

When I started at work, Omelette was a website I visited every day, and when Google Reader was shut down, omelette's Feed was usually in the low double digits, and at one point I considered advertising Omelette.

The Internet industry in Wuhan is not very good, but there are some unique products coming into being. Although it can't be done, it is like a common sense to call it a "Harvard" , but it also has strong vitality and occupies an unremarkable market segment.

The Dolphin Browser, which flourished in the Android overseas market, was also hatched in Wuhan Guanggu. ACFUN, which first brought the bomb screen mode to China, is one of the bases, including the Betta fish, which was later dismantled, has a lot of support from the local government.

Of course, there are also some unseemly Internet companies in Wuhan, such as the rogue software browser 2345, which even operates on a shares, and the Taobao machine shop Ningmeidu, which many have ridiculed, the office is on Rue Lane.

Wuhan is full of talents, as you can see from Lei Jun's memory of Wuhan University, but it is also one of Wuhan's traditional skills to retain talents. Sitting on top university resources, it can only serve as a transit station, as enterprises come to recruit students for the school, after graduating from college students fly apart, are willing to settle in Wuhan few.

I said Wuhan is a city suitable for life, in fact, this is not 100% pleasant to hear, because its subtext is, Wuhan is not a city suitable for struggle.

Young people want to change their situation, what they need is not a prosperous life in the city, but an opportunity to sail against the current. The reason why they are firmly in the camp of first-tier cities in Guangzhou and Shenzhen is that they have an equal inventory of opportunities, even bare-handed, there are opportunities to seize the possibility of achieving the dream of class rise.

Wuhan does not offer such a stage. It is more like a dressing room behind the stage, where the faceless actors rest, wait, rub their hands together and wait for the stage. Few people have feelings for the haphazard dressing room.

Yes, Wuhan is a stingy and cramped city, and I love this about it, because not everyone has to rise above the fray, and those who give up the reward have the right to refuse to give. There must always be such a city, you can take in people who want comfort.

I lived in Beijing for six years, go out to eat most of the place, is the Chinese restaurant in Hubei Mansion, just a mouthful of ribs lotus root soup and do not put scallion hot and dry noodles, at this time, I feel that he gave up too much, not worth the world.

This sudden disaster, perhaps for the first time in six years, made my days in Wuhan seem like a blur, only the streets of the city were closed, and the old life vanished like the blood of a wounded animal, but can only shrink the low voice sobs, wrings painful sentiment, also crumpled the human heart.

Sometimes even watching the news is divisive. For example, the more you praise the "hard core" of local governments, the more I feel the contrast is sad. For example, when I see the headlines of suspected cases dropping four days in a row in my circle of friends, click in and have a look, another parenthesis was added, except for Hubei, where my blood pressure spiked..

Like me, perhaps, many people have a plan to make up for what they've lost in these days, after the epidemic subsides, with retaliatory spending, binge eating, binge smoking, binge drinking, and sharing the joy of survival with the rest of the world.

I hope this day comes soon. By the way, today is the Lantern Festival, I do not expect to eat dumplings, I wish you and your families peace.

This is my diary of the siege of Wuhan, day 17.
