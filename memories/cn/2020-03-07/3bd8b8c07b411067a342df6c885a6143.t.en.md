They both found it was a long time since they had ordered milk tea with their colleagues. After returning to work, Chen Jiang and his group of friends once went to the gate of the park to pick up take-out food. After that, they had to go through another temperature test, registration, disinfection and hand washing. Later, they didn't order any more.

Chen Jiang, an employee at a large factory in Hangzhou, has been back at work for two weeks. Every day for two weeks, Chen and his colleagues were given two free KF94 masks made in South Korea. He checked the price. On the Internet, masks like this cost $34 a pop. He jokes to colleagues that he can now earn $34 a day, even doing nothing -- as if he were saving one mask and the other. He didn't have the luxury of a surgical mask.

You have to sit in a room for eight hours every day wearing a mask. But also can not easily untie, every hour, Chen Jiang company property will go upstairs to check everyone's mask wearing situation. He would go out for a smoke and breathe quietly for a while. Now even happy fishing time has to be compressed. In the smoking area, a new and obvious sign has been put up advising everyone to "take care of yourself when you are relaxed" , not to gather, not to talk, when you're done, put on your mask and leave.

Wu Pei, the treasurer of a state-owned enterprise in Anhui Province, gets a mask a day. On the first day back to work, around 4 pm, she suddenly felt dyspnea because she had been wearing a mask all day. But even so, she didn't dare take it off. Because of the nature of her work, a lot of people come and go in and out of her office, and it's a risk.

Zheng Qi, who runs a real estate company in Beijing, can get at least one blue medical disposable mask every day. In fact, the mask is in the box at the door. If you have a thick skin, take a stack. Zheng Qi now mask inventory, a part from the company's distribution, another part from the help of friends.

Yuan Quan's media company calls itself a strap on headset, a type of headset that requires instructional videos to set aside time to learn how to wear. Yuan Quan described it as "like a little dragon girl with a white string around her head" . She also stores company-issued face masks and uses hers.

On February 11, the State Council issued a regulation: Enterprises to resume work to issue face masks and other protective supplies. But when it comes to practice, the rule is not 100% enforceable.

Qi Min, from Nanjing, works for a study abroad agency. Before returning to work, the company promised to hand out masks to its employees every day. The promise lasted only one day, and on February 25th, the day after they returned to work, hr informed them that the masks were gone.

The company's next series of operations, let them more puzzled: Employees do not get the mask should be issued, but masks can be sold individually to the staff in need, 3.50 yuan each. And, for every student who comes in, there are five free masks -- as if it were part of the admissions literature.

Qi Min chats with her colleagues. What if the mask is really gone? They joke that breast-feeding colleagues can use anti-spillage pads, and can store more diapers, or at worst, put diapers around their heads to go out, anyway, now buy diapers than masks much easier.

Having the mask fixed is only a necessary condition to be able to resume work. To get back to work, YOU'RE GONNA have to break through a lot of barriers.

Judith's workplace is in the heart of Chaoyang District, Beijing. The first day back to work, ID card on the Wuhan Census Register almost let her not even upstairs. In fact, however, she did not even spend the New Year at her home in Hubei Province.

The city of Hangzhou, where Chen is based, has a health code, which allows people to take public transport as long as they have green qr codes. But he found that access to the health code several times, and bus drivers mostly by the naked eye code, as long as it is green, can get on the bus. Acquaintances saved a screenshot of the code in a photo album and showed it to the driver -- as if they were getting on.

Compared with Chen, Yuan Quan's commute was a little more arduous. She lived far away from the office. In the old days, she sometimes took the subway and sometimes took a taxi. Since returning to work, in order to prevent cross-infection on the subway, she almost every time to take a taxi to the office. On a good day, it's $70 a trip, and in traffic, it's a little over $100 a ride. Besides the high fare, taxis are not easy to take. At work on Monday, Yuan Quan waited for an hour at the community gate before getting a cab.

Wu Pei for the resumption of work itself, many financial software only on the company's computer, and because most of the relevant units did not start, the actual workload has been reduced by half compared with the previous. What makes her head hurt is that it is too much trouble to go to work now, and she is a person who is afraid of trouble.

Her community is under a closed system, and each family is allowed three times a week, one person to go out and buy supplies. If you have to go back to work, you have to use a red-headed document in exchange for a sticker on the car pass, in order to unimpeded. Occasionally, Wu Pei's mother also goes out to buy vegetables by car, the number exceeds the standard, must be stopped to question.

For most people returning to work, a warm shot to the head is the start of the day.

The elevator is divided into black and yellow wide tape area, the larger elevator is divided into nine grid, smaller into four grid. The elevator buttons at Yuan Quan's company are wrapped in Saran wrap, just as Saran wrap used to be around remote controls at home. That's not good enough. There's paper towels hanging from the elevator walls, you wrap your hands in paper, and you push a button.

The smell of disinfectant in the air can be clearly smelled even with a mask on. Some people worry, though, that the layers of containment have become so rigid that they are inconvenient.

Wu Pei takes her temperature at the door every day and needs to register on the form herself. There are two boxes on the table. The box on the left is the sterilized pen. After signing, the pen is put into the box on the right, waiting for the uniform sterilization. But she still felt uneasy, from the day of the resumption of work, she more than a pen habit.

Yuan Quan was ready to go back to work. She's given herself a small area where her arms and feet can't reach out to safety. She also brought a box of disposable latex gloves and an alcohol spray to keep at work. She had to take off her mask to drink, so she went to the window to drink. The Open Cup was no longer safe, so she rummaged through the house and found a thermos with a lid, which she had never used before.

As soon as she left her station, she sprayed alcohol on the soles of her feet and wore gloves when she went to the bathroom. On one occasion, she went to the toilet to find a toilet who forgot to flush, a moment, "Aerosol" , "faecal transmission" and other words in mind, as if sounded the alarm. She held her breath and rushed out.

By the second week back at work, the fuss was over, because she was tired of it. Her Department began working shifts the next week, and she was the only one in the office most of the time. Her "safe zone" is getting bigger, alcohol sprays are being used less and less, and when colleagues forget to flush the toilet, she has a little more understanding: she must be busy cleaning her hands, forget to flush. Flush the toilet calmly, go back to your station, and go later.

Some invisible changes are taking place in familiar environments.

Yuan Quan found herself spending more on food than ever before. After eating too many half-cooked home-cooked meals during her isolation at home, she returned to her office in the CBD area and started making retaliatory purchases of "complicated takeout" such as Spaghetti marinades and hand-beaten beef burgers, eggs Benedict. She calculated that since the resumption of work, the Engel's Coefficient has greatly improved, "This Day, feel good to work to lose money. "

Chen's factory, which used to be the envy of the canteen, now limits itself to 150 cacciatore. Every day at noon, he would receive a meal alert from the company's internal system, which told him what time his meal was today, and which combination of Bento he could choose.

In order to prevent infection during the meal, the dining hall rearranged the seats. Tables are two meters apart, and only one person can eat at each table, just like an exam. The company encourages people to bring food back to their desks because it's safer that way, or bring a lunch from home and heat it up in the company microwave. Chen has noticed that seven new microwaves have been added to his floor since he resumed work.

Like Chen, Zheng Qi's canteen, which was originally a buffet, is now a delivery box. The options range from a full table, down to a separate table in a disposable plastic box.

At first, Zheng Qi would attend yoga classes at the company after work, and then go home. Now, the event has also been canceled. Also cancelled is the strict system of punching a time card. In the old days, you had to punch in at 9 a.m. , and if you were late more than you were allowed to be late each month, you had to deduct money. Now, it doesn't matter if it's after 10:00.

Like Yuan Quan, his company operates on a shift basis. She went to the company once or twice a week, the specific week to go to work, is arranged by colleagues, a week in advance to inform her.

Even when she went to the office, she worked alone in front of a computer and never saw her colleagues. If there's a meeting, it's still a conference call. Zheng suspects that the requirement to return to work may be due to productivity concerns, but she feels that she is just as productive at home as she is at work, if you count the patience frayed by the barriers of vaccination, probably be more productive at home.

Even in the same office, we try not to talk. Chen Jiang and his immediate supervisor are separated by only three working positions, in the usual, because the leadership to see the news is not so timely, when there is an emergency, he will directly to the leadership next to the face. Now, the leadership reply message is still not so timely, at this time, he chose to call the leadership.

Several of his group of 20 colleagues returned to Hangzhou but were under 14-day quarantine, so when the time came for a meeting, they sat at their desks, turned on their office software and wore masks to make voice calls.

They both found it was a long time since they had ordered milk tea with their colleagues. After returning to work, Chen Jiang and his group of friends once went to the gate of the park to pick up take-out food. After that, they had to go through another temperature test, registration, disinfection and hand washing. Later, they didn't order any more.

Chen Jiang also found that he had a face-blindness problem, before he was not like this. Sometimes in the elevator with co-workers, two people stand in a corner of the nine Gong Ge, colleagues and he beckoned, Chen Jiang only by the upper half of the face does not recognize who it is, can only follow back a "long time no see. ".

It's all wrapped up, people's lower faces, buttons in the elevator, the driver's seat. The familiar world is enveloped in a veil of Strangeness and Strangeness. One day after work, Yuan Quan was sitting in a taxi. It was raining outside. The water drops on the windows reflected the evening sky in Beijing. Even during the evening rush hour, there was no rush hour. Yuan Quan used to love the "rain out the window, I'm in the car" feeling, but now she's starting to wonder if there's a virus in the rain and the mud?

The smell of disinfectant in the air can be clearly smelled even with a mask on. Some people worry, though, that the layers of containment have become so rigid that they are inconvenient.

Wu Pei takes her temperature at the door every day and needs to register on the form herself. There are two boxes on the table. The box on the left is the sterilized pen. After signing, the pen is put into the box on the right, waiting for the uniform sterilization. But she still felt uneasy, from the day of the resumption of work, she more than a pen habit.

Yuan Quan was ready to go back to work. She's given herself a small area where her arms and feet can't reach out to safety. She also brought a box of disposable latex gloves and an alcohol spray to keep at work. She had to take off her mask to drink, so she went to the window to drink. The Open Cup was no longer safe, so she rummaged through the house and found a thermos with a lid, which she had never used before.

As soon as she left her station, she sprayed alcohol on the soles of her feet and wore gloves when she went to the bathroom. On one occasion, she went to the toilet to find a toilet who forgot to flush, a moment, "Aerosol" , "faecal transmission" and other words in mind, as if sounded the alarm. She held her breath and rushed out.

By the second week back at work, the fuss was over, because she was tired of it. Her Department began working shifts the next week, and she was the only one in the office most of the time. Her "safe zone" is getting bigger, alcohol sprays are being used less and less, and when colleagues forget to flush the toilet, she has a little more understanding: she must be busy cleaning her hands, forget to flush. Flush the toilet calmly, go back to your station, and go later.

Having the mask fixed is only a necessary condition to be able to resume work. To get back to work, YOU'RE GONNA have to break through a lot of barriers.

Judith's workplace is in the heart of Chaoyang District, Beijing. The first day back to work, ID card on the Wuhan Census Register almost let her not even upstairs. In fact, however, she did not even spend the New Year at her home in Hubei Province.

The city of Hangzhou, where Chen is based, has a health code, which allows people to take public transport as long as they have green qr codes. But he found that access to the health code several times, and bus drivers mostly by the naked eye code, as long as it is green, can get on the bus. Acquaintances saved a screenshot of the code in a photo album and showed it to the driver -- as if they were getting on.

Compared with Chen, Yuan Quan's commute was a little more arduous. She lived far away from the office. In the old days, she sometimes took the subway and sometimes took a taxi. Since returning to work, in order to prevent cross-infection on the subway, she almost every time to take a taxi to the office. On a good day, it's $70 a trip, and in traffic, it's a little over $100 a ride. Besides the high fare, taxis are not easy to take. At work on Monday, Yuan Quan waited for an hour at the community gate before getting a cab.

Wu Pei for the resumption of work itself, many financial software only on the company's computer, and because most of the relevant units did not start, the actual workload has been reduced by half compared with the previous. What makes her head hurt is that it is too much trouble to go to work now, and she is a person who is afraid of trouble.

Her community is under a closed system, and each family is allowed three times a week, one person to go out and buy supplies. If you have to go back to work, you have to use a red-headed document in exchange for a sticker on the car pass, in order to unimpeded. Occasionally, Wu Pei's mother also goes out to buy vegetables by car, the number exceeds the standard, must be stopped to question.

For most people returning to work, a warm shot to the head is the start of the day.

The elevator is divided into black and yellow wide tape area, the larger elevator is divided into nine grid, smaller into four grid. The elevator buttons at Yuan Quan's company are wrapped in Saran wrap, just as Saran wrap used to be around remote controls at home. That's not good enough. There's paper towels hanging from the elevator walls, you wrap your hands in paper, and you push a button.

Some invisible changes are taking place in familiar environments.

Yuan Quan found herself spending more on food than ever before. After eating too many half-cooked home-cooked meals during her isolation at home, she returned to her office in the CBD area and started making retaliatory purchases of "complicated takeout" such as Spaghetti marinades and hand-beaten beef burgers, eggs Benedict. She calculated that since the resumption of work, the Engel's Coefficient has greatly improved, "This Day, feel good to work to lose money. "

Chen's factory, which used to be the envy of the canteen, now limits itself to 150 cacciatore. Every day at noon, he would receive a meal alert from the company's internal system, which told him what time his meal was today, and which combination of Bento he could choose.

In order to prevent infection during the meal, the dining hall rearranged the seats. Tables are two meters apart, and only one person can eat at each table, just like an exam. The company encourages people to bring food back to their desks because it's safer that way, or bring a lunch from home and heat it up in the company microwave. Chen has noticed that seven new microwaves have been added to his floor since he resumed work.

Like Chen, Zheng Qi's canteen, which was originally a buffet, is now a delivery box. The options range from a full table, down to a separate table in a disposable plastic box.

At first, Zheng Qi would attend yoga classes at the company after work, and then go home. Now, the event has also been canceled. Also cancelled is the strict system of punching a time card. In the old days, you had to punch in at 9 a.m. , and if you were late more than you were allowed to be late each month, you had to deduct money. Now, it doesn't matter if it's after 10:00.

Like Yuan Quan, his company operates on a shift basis. She went to the company once or twice a week, the specific week to go to work, is arranged by colleagues, a week in advance to inform her.

Even when she went to the office, she worked alone in front of a computer and never saw her colleagues. If there's a meeting, it's still a conference call. Zheng suspects that the requirement to return to work may be due to productivity concerns, but she feels that she is just as productive at home as she is at work, if you count the patience frayed by the barriers of vaccination, probably be more productive at home.

Even in the same office, we try not to talk. Chen Jiang and his immediate supervisor are separated by only three working positions, in the usual, because the leadership to see the news is not so timely, when there is an emergency, he will directly to the leadership next to the face. Now, the leadership reply message is still not so timely, at this time, he chose to call the leadership.

Several of his group of 20 colleagues returned to Hangzhou but were under 14-day quarantine, so when the time came for a meeting, they sat at their desks, turned on their office software and wore masks to make voice calls.

They both found it was a long time since they had ordered milk tea with their colleagues. After returning to work, Chen Jiang and his group of friends once went to the gate of the park to pick up take-out food. After that, they had to go through another temperature test, registration, disinfection and hand washing. Later, they didn't order any more.

Chen Jiang also found that he had a face-blindness problem, before he was not like this. Sometimes in the elevator with co-workers, two people stand in a corner of the nine Gong Ge, colleagues and he beckoned, Chen Jiang only by the upper half of the face does not recognize who it is, can only follow back a "long time no see. ".

It's all wrapped up, people's lower faces, buttons in the elevator, the driver's seat. The familiar world is enveloped in a veil of Strangeness and Strangeness. One day after work, Yuan Quan was sitting in a taxi. It was raining outside. The water drops on the windows reflected the evening sky in Beijing. Even during the evening rush hour, there was no rush hour. Yuan Quan used to love the "rain out the window, I'm in the car" feeling, but now she's starting to wonder if there's a virus in the rain and the mud?

A film still from "we who can not be beasts"
