This year, Wuhan University opened its online Yunshang Ying, and also invited the medical team that Supports Wuhan to go to Wuhan University to see the Cherry Blossoms. If they go to the Cherry Orchard now, and there are no other tourists, the students also stay at home and take photos and enjoy the flowers. In fact, East L. is also suitable for Cherry blossoms, you can also take the Greenway, rent a bike and drive around the lake.

In the past, the March and April Cherry Blossom Festival was crowded on the way back to the dormitory, and the dining hall was unable to grab food. At first, we wanted to avoid the rush hour. We chose to go to see the cherry blossoms at the end of the evening class, around 9:30. We did not expect that there would be many tourists, because there would be no admission tickets in the evening, a few doors in and out.

The night wind, falling petals Susu, Street Lamp Night Cherry riotous, remember I and my roommates on a whim, in the flower photo, mobile phone automatically switch on Flash, shot out a red eye, shout "do not pass on others without my consent / Ai, give me a p again / ah, delete delete, black history can not stay in your phone" .

Starbucks' annual Cherry Blossom Cup comes online, and the "Cherry blossom season limit" of all kinds of pink powder is coming soon. I saw a Japanese information blogger once again popularizing the phrase "come to Japan to enjoy cherry blossoms, don't taste cherry blossom flavor" , i found the Cherry blossom flavors to be unpalatable, as the blogger concluded, either by adding a bunch of flavors of Saccharin, which was sweet and had nothing to do with the Cherry blossoms, or by the salty flavor of pickled cherry blossoms, jesting in Pale Pink Cherry blossoms, it's like a pickle.

I have a very deep shadow of Salt Cherry, the first to learn to do jelly, think transparent jelly wrapped cherry blossom, like amber, and because there is no color, natural light crystal clear, shiny. Mold added a few spoonfuls, after the shape-setting impatient to bite, bad to spit into the garbage can immediately, Mengguan several mouthwashes Gargle, from then on do not dare to easily take the cherry into the dish.

The ending of "what I don't need to know" is a tough one to live with. "The wrong person at the wrong time, the wrong time, and soulmate goes their separate ways" is the perfect ending for both of them in their current state, the best doesn't equal the best, but both have tried, putting themselves in each other's shoes, such as what to do with the children of their ex wives sandwiched between them, and it's even sadder to think that Kate and Oggi are both trying so hard to get back together.

A lot of people complain that career and love are always the opposite of EITHER/OR, as if choosing to concentrate on your career will lead to a lonely old age, Kate Love Wei Gao, but not love to want to marry him right away, her heart hesitated, do not know whether to seize the opportunity to get back together, see the wife and children, Kate thought of his own past, but do not want to get involved in immoral. It was this swing, the first time she turned down Oggi's invitation, the second time she summoned the courage to offer to co-parent, and Oggi turned her down, "not liking her like this. ". "I have to prepare myself for BE" , it's only been a few months since 2020, and CP was born.

Looking back at the photos, one word, abuse (more and more clear why Hiroshi Tamaki talked to the Yuriko Yoshitaka, the man took the initiative to confess, the original Hiroshi Tamaki in the interview and variety said that like voluptuous mature sister hang of women) .

In the second season of the kingdom, the plot lines are drawn, fighting off zombies and Miyanaka taking power, and after two seasons, I can't help but say: North Korea is about to be overrun by Zombies, is it fun to cling to the throne, zombies don't care if the people on the other side are government officials, if you're alive, take a few bites. The Middle Temple is really fierce, can not get the thing rather destroy, release the corpse to come out of the cage to die together. Jun ji-hyun ends with a five-second profile, which leads to the third season of I don't know when it will air.

During the epidemic watch this show, I think the settings of the Zombie virus and pneumonia somewhat similar, highly contagious, fear of high temperatures, the weather back to the automatic retreat, to the end of the second season did not have a cure, temporarily into a seasonal outbreak.

I also wanted to jinx myself. I had just said that I wanted to see Mulan, and I didn't want the release of the film to be delayed. That's great. The official announcement has been postponed. It's absolutely impossible to see Mulan at the end of March in the face of the global epidemic, 007: too late to die and the new mutant have also been postponed. Alas, I suddenly felt that even if I had the chance to go to the cinema to see a movie (the last time I went to the cinema was last November) , I still have no movie to see, no movie to want to see. Look on the bright side. Second half of the year, weekends at the movies.

Inside Out asks whether lipstick sales are up or down in the bad economy, but with masks on and many women choosing not to wear lipstick in the current epidemic. Combined with the retaliatory consumption after the resumption of work, the sales of eye make-up and eyebrow pencil, the upper half of the face of beauty products, should increase. If one searches the analysis reports released by several e-commerce and retail consultants recently, the sales of eye products have indeed increased significantly, i did not consider the hand cream, frequent hand washing caused hand skin uncomfortable, so let more people pay attention to the maintenance of hands (eye cream the same) .

Buy a great beer and head back to Florida straight after you've had it. The alcohol degree is about 3.7, the color is limpid, the taste is light, and added the mint, is very refreshing! Before the first SIP, I hesitated. I felt that the minty food tastes like black toothpaste. In fact, the minty flavor is very light. I need to look carefully in the aftertaste. There is no pungent refreshment of fresh leaves. On the contrary, it quenches my thirst, i think it's as good as cold and white. When I invited my mom for a taste, my mom didn't understand what it meant to drink beer without food or barbecue, i said it would be more comfortable to drink beer alone (I don't really like drinking beer with dinner, it's fizzy, it makes me sick, and I can't eat it, and if I drink it by the case like my male colleagues, I'll throw up on the spot) . I also bought Matt's Tangerine Peel Lager, which tastes better than mint and tastes like Tangerine Peel, the most common craft beer.

My colleague told me that Xi'an has returned to normal this week, more and more people are in the shopping malls, buses and subways are feeling crowded gradually, some scenic spots also have people going hiking on weekends, the most happy thing is that the heating of the air conditioning is restored in the units, down Jackets can be stowed in the closet, and the cafeteria officially serves brunch. You don't have to eat half-cold boxed meals at your desk. When I get back, the department plans to have dinner at the new home of one of our newly married colleagues. In fact, we're going to have a fight in the new house at the end of last year, did Not expect him to meet the team, made a mistake in the living room TV wall, have to find manufacturers custom, rework rework, the delay of nearly a month.

A number of policies have been released to "Untie" Wuhan people. For example, residents in the zero-infection community can be arranged to have activities in the community in an orderly manner. It is obvious that middle-aged and elderly people in our community all go out to walk their dogs and bask in the Sun, also saw an uncle facing the flower bed of Tea Meng Pai, feel he will be the next second to send friends and friends circle, and then a small poem. Younger residents began to group Rio, the community has a small basketball court, usually play badminton can also be. The ground floor residents began to loosen the soil to fertilize, planting new flowers and vegetables, spring is just right, can not waste a hair.

Neighborhood row on the supermarket's cheap frozen pork belly, in the past the community opened a pass certificate, the residents with cars drove to the supermarket to help pick up the goods, because several events in Qingshan district, the property said the above issued a notice, allowing only the cold chain car carrier to overstock the meat, none of the other cars work. A few owners signed up to offer private cars pulling meat, property to wait, there is a special cold-chain car into the community. Residents wait left and right, and finally wait for the delivery of pork belly of the car, the master put the frozen meat on the property and drove away, said that there are a lot of single queue to send. Everyone looked at a few large pieces of pork simply did not cut, a piece of a hundred Jin, stiff like a brick.

Everyone in a circle around the meat, each speechless, each order is not the same, now directly to the whole meat, I do not know how to split. Later the property for each unit to negotiate the solution, first take a piece of their own, more back less fill. They carried the meat to the Gazebo, covered it with a disposable tablecloth, and then borrowed a kitchen knife and an electronic scale to cut the meat piece by piece according to the order. Fortunately today is quite warm, the meat defrosts quickly, at first the kitchen knife can not cut, chops up as the clanking. Some people bought three Jins, some people bought five Jins, so how to cut again became a problem, everyone in order to share meat, Chirp for several hours, or feel short of two Jins, clearly only 2.88 Jins, or feel too fat to give themselves, all fat.

Quarrel to noon, finally finished pork belly, take home after I see the group began to struggle with why only pork belly, before also ordered frozen ribs, money is transferred. The volunteers explained that the supermarket has only pork belly in stock these days. If you want to eat pork chops, you have to wait for next week's purchase, or choose a refund. So the group started a new round of "direct refund or continue to wait" debate.

I used to stand at the window overlooking the park, the past empty, yesterday actually saw a black uncle, leisurely walk on the Green Road. I have not experienced such obvious jealousy and envy for a long time. My feet are jumping in anger and my voice is clay. I pointed to the direction of the park and said, "Look! There are people walking in the park! Aren't you not allowed to go out of the neighborhood? " My parents told me to calm down, make a big deal out of it, and the park has to be cleaned regularly, and it's not like it's not in the papers, and the sanitation workers go to work every day, and most of them are janitors.

"How can it be, cleaning two hands not behind his back, posture at a glance is walking, leisurely" , now I think of it, I really and eat a few lemons, but also depressed that I am still locked in the home, unable to walk, every word can squeeze out a basin of vinegar, "don't cleaners sweep the floor 24 hours a day, people can not rest, or those surrounding the old community, not strict management, not out of the clay. ". Wuhan words to describe my complaint, is a typical "find crooked" , deliberately find fault, my heart is not happy, simply see the park that the old man in black are not happy, think about the state of mind is really bad.

Everyone is praying that the virus is heat-resistant, that high temperatures will be difficult to spread and stock, that the weather will be warm and then slowly fade away, that there will be no vaccines or specific drugs in the short term, and that it is the forces of nature that feel that the global pandemic has finally been brought to a halt, it's not that we beat the virus, it's that the virus has passed on to humans (as has been the case in the past, the new coronaviruses are especially kind to children, infection rates are low in young children, and most infections are mild and easily treatable) .

Looking around at the latest figures, Spain is fast becoming the second Italy to worry about Japan and South Korea, which seem to have flattened the curve. Some netizens expressed the feeling that "the virus can only be controlled and not accepted" . They did not ask other countries to learn from the Chinese way of sealing off cities. They said that the means could be used by Buddhists to reduce the panic of the people. However, psychologically, we must attach importance to it and do a good job of protecting it, instead of trying to minimize the impact of the virus, publicity is nothing. It's like the flu. Pride gets people killed sometimes.

I have a very deep shadow of Salt Cherry, the first to learn to do jelly, think transparent jelly wrapped cherry blossom, like amber, and because there is no color, natural light crystal clear, shiny. Mold added a few spoonfuls, after the shape-setting impatient to bite, bad to spit into the garbage can immediately, Mengguan several mouthwashes Gargle, from then on do not dare to easily take the cherry into the dish.

Everyone in a circle around the meat, each speechless, each order is not the same, now directly to the whole meat, I do not know how to split. Later the property for each unit to negotiate the solution, first take a piece of their own, more back less fill. They carried the meat to the Gazebo, covered it with a disposable tablecloth, and then borrowed a kitchen knife and an electronic scale to cut the meat piece by piece according to the order. Fortunately today is quite warm, the meat defrosts quickly, at first the kitchen knife can not cut, chops up as the clanking. Some people bought three Jins, some people bought five Jins, so how to cut again became a problem, everyone in order to share meat, Chirp for several hours, or feel short of two Jins, clearly only 2.88 Jins, or feel too fat to give themselves, all fat.

Quarrel to noon, finally finished pork belly, take home after I see the group began to struggle with why only pork belly, before also ordered frozen ribs, money is transferred. The volunteers explained that the supermarket has only pork belly in stock these days. If you want to eat pork chops, you have to wait for next week's purchase, or choose a refund. So the group started a new round of "direct refund or continue to wait" debate.

I used to stand at the window overlooking the park, the past empty, yesterday actually saw a black uncle, leisurely walk on the Green Road. I have not experienced such obvious jealousy and envy for a long time. My feet are jumping in anger and my voice is clay. I pointed to the direction of the park and said, "Look! There are people walking in the park! Aren't you not allowed to go out of the neighborhood? " My parents told me to calm down, make a big deal out of it, and the park has to be cleaned regularly, and it's not like it's not in the papers, and the sanitation workers go to work every day, and most of them are janitors.

"How can it be, cleaning two hands not behind his back, posture at a glance is walking, leisurely" , now I think of it, I really and eat a few lemons, but also depressed that I am still locked in the home, unable to walk, every word can squeeze out a basin of vinegar, "don't cleaners sweep the floor 24 hours a day, people can not rest, or those surrounding the old community, not strict management, not out of the clay. ". Wuhan words to describe my complaint, is a typical "find crooked" , deliberately find fault, my heart is not happy, simply see the park that the old man in black are not happy, think about the state of mind is really bad.

Everyone is praying that the virus is heat-resistant, that high temperatures will be difficult to spread and stock, that the weather will be warm and then slowly fade away, that there will be no vaccines or specific drugs in the short term, and that it is the forces of nature that feel that the global pandemic has finally been brought to a halt, it's not that we beat the virus, it's that the virus has passed on to humans (as has been the case in the past, the new coronaviruses are especially kind to children, infection rates are low in young children, and most infections are mild and easily treatable) .

Looking around at the latest figures, Spain is fast becoming the second Italy to worry about Japan and South Korea, which seem to have flattened the curve. Some netizens expressed the feeling that "the virus can only be controlled and not accepted" . They did not ask other countries to learn from the Chinese way of sealing off cities. They said that the means could be used by Buddhists to reduce the panic of the people. However, psychologically, we must attach importance to it and do a good job of protecting it, instead of trying to minimize the impact of the virus, publicity is nothing. It's like the flu. Pride gets people killed sometimes.
