I want to talk to you today about a common sense.

I also read the Weibo Account of the young man whose father was hospitalized until his death and had to prove his innocence to clear his name of the false accusations.

I would like to say that it is perfectly normal for true and false news to be mixed during such a major and sudden disaster. It is unacceptable to regard "some false and erroneous news" as one of them, the demand that everyone cut open their bellies to clarify just how many bowls of Jelly there really is is not going to happen unless the whole people shut up.

Set yourself up as a figment of the imagination, whether it be a foreign power or a mastermind, it may inspire a common bond, but it can also be a hangnail, diluting the resources of attention that should be used for concentration.

To be paranoid, in the end, is to break trust and admit Bug.

If the information is wrong, then correct it carefully one by one. If you don't know whether it's true or false, try to control your emotions and defend your national dignity. First of all, you should not be conspicuous, worry about panic, and you should not let others cry pain. These are all very simple truths, in normal times and in extraordinary times, it works.

It's important to care about the real people, not to objectify them, or even show off perfectly accurate bullet holes, and with all due respect, most of you don't have a target to shoot at, so don't play games with yourself.

Be a human being.

Let me tell you about Wuhan, in terms of the radius of my life, because the residents of the residential area have many foreigners, and most of them have not returned to their homeland, and I don't expect to be able to go back to Florida for a while, probably because the temperature is too cold, there is no sun during the day, even stray cats are not often seen.

The supply chain of the chain stores is operating normally, and because the number of people reduced the demand is not so high, so the store of living materials is still relatively sufficient, each household has also stored dry food, not a big problem.

The trouble is medicine, the circulation of this commodity is controlled, some essential drugs once out of stock, the consequences are not so ideal, many pharmacies did not open, opened many shelves are empty, replenishment still needs time.

The ban on motor vehicles, however, does deserve the best reading comprehension. At present, it means that the owner of the prohibited vehicle will receive instructions, and the vehicle that is not received will be passable, but because of the existence of a large mold and space, driving is still a risky business, both epidemic and legal.

Of course, those who really need a car, such as pregnant women who are in labor, should still drive, without having to adhere to the temporary rules of community car ownership, which is too inflexible. It used to be said that the atomisation of Chinese society was very high, but at the moment of crisis, there is still the capacity for spontaneous community organization, and many drivers have joined the motorcade, responding voluntarily to emergency car use needs and showing genuine affection in every detail.

There are even people willing to pay a conscientious search fee to feed or temporarily adopt pets whose owners have left China and are not expected to return for a long time.

I mean, order is never built from the top down, people aren't workers, they're just waiting in line to get the rice back to the hole, we can do a lot of things, and the more disaster strikes, the more we stick together, and the more we help each other, it's not what the people mess with, it's what they don't mess with.

Companies have done a lot for Wuhan, including my dinner object Ali (manual gambling) , very down-to-earth announced that the box Ma fresh shelf will not be empty, such a move, but also a lot of people feel reassured.

Again, people panic, but they don't die, and the number of new cases of cap being diagnosed across the country is soaring every day, and that's not just a problem that people can solve, we need more good news.

This is my diary of the siege of Wuhan, day four.
