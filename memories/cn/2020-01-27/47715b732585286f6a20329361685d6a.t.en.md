I am from Xinyang, Henan Province. I studied in Wuhan. After graduation, I stayed in Wuhan. Now I live in Hongshan District. I am the mother of a 1-year-old child. Wuhan is the epicenter of the outbreak, and its hometown, Xinyang, is close to the city and is now the focus of the investigation.
On January 20, three days before the "closure" of the city, Academician Zhong Nanshan mentioned the existence of human-to-human transmission of new coronary pneumonia. I just watched the news for a little while, and I didn't panic. Since the number of reported cases was low and the death rate low, my response to the incident was somewhat delayed due to a fluke. Probably also from the 20th, Wuhan became the focus of the public, and panic began to breed.
On January 21, a friend in the neighborhood sent me a message reminding me not to run around with my children. The streets were covered with masks. But two days ago when we were in the vicinity of Hoida when no one is wearing a mask, may be the role of the academician appeal, we began to pay attention to up. Our property response is also relatively timely, the same day on the elevator for disinfection. Later, the elevator keys are covered with plastic wrap, a day to change.

In fact, we have avoided taking our children to crowded places and have not had close contact with others since mid December, when Wuhan was hit by the flu and many primary schools and kindergartens were closed. Friends also told me that n95 masks at the nearby pharmacy cost 58 yuan each. I quickly inventory the home mask, N95 there are about 10, disposable masks 220, I think these masks should be enough. At this point, I wasn't panicking. I just thought everything was fine.

The masks we had in the house

On the 22nd, the day before the city was shut down, the fear of pneumonia in Wuhan was growing. I see a lot of news in the circle of friends: A friend because of Wuhan ID card was unbooked hotel, a friend to go home through Wuhan Station feel panic, a friend to change the ticket not to transfer from Wuhan, a friend to return the ticket from Wuhan home.
That's when I realized things weren't as rosy as I'd hoped. We cancelled our shopping trip to the supermarket. At night, I repeatedly brush the news about Wuhan Pneumonia, until two or three o'clock in the morning, the network Wuhan "closed city" sound a lot. I'm scared. Although subconsciously I felt that the possibility of an extreme situation was small, I was still afraid that the situation would worsen, that there would be a shortage of daily necessities or that prices would be bid up. To be safe, I bought a lot of milk powder and diapers online, and some raw, praying that my order still gets delivered.
January 23 at 5:00 am, just fell asleep less than two hours, I was the baby's Hum wakened, to the baby after the milk, I opened a micro-blog to see, the brain suddenly confused, really "closed city" ? Although these two days as the matter ferments, my husband and I also discussed Wuhan will not be "closed city" problem, but the conclusion is very unlikely. Wuhan as one of the National Transportation Hubs, "City closure" after the impact, how to do residents' lives?
Calm down, I also feel at the moment, "closed city" is perhaps the most reasonable arrangement. But what about our lives? That's my biggest concern right now. I wonder if everyone will go out to grab food at first light, if prices will soar. I opened the e-commerce site, the price is normal, and under two single fresh, regardless of whether it can be delivered, finally a little peace of mind.
After placing the order, I woke up my husband and told him the news of the "closure" . He was still in a daze, and I tried not to panic. My husband slowed down a few seconds, with just woke up the nasal voice back to me: "Or 'closed city' . ".
When he came to, he looked at the map, and the road was clear. 'If I want to go back to my hometown in Henan, this is my last chance, ' he said. 'If I want to go, I'll go now. '. I refused, I do not want to go back to trouble home, now go back to oneself and others are a test.
Our main problem is the means of subsistence. At 6:30 in the morning, my husband set off for Zhongbai Supermarket. The supermarket was not open yet, but there were many people waiting at the gate of the supermarket. 8:30, the husband purchase back, I looked, cabbage 1.99 yuan a catty, potatoes 2.99 yuan a catty, are still the normal price. But that morning Wuhan food prices went up on Weibo. We're just glad we made our move this morning. In fact, the price of food is basically normal, the price of the net pass the supermarket is also talked about.

Food for the siege

We took stock of the family's supplies, living two or three months is enough, that is, vegetables to regularly go shopping.
For the moment, nothing happened. We followed the traffic in Wuhan through the map APP, and watched as the traffic conditions on several out-of-town lanes slowly changed from green to red. Friends Circle, some friends in the traffic jam left Wuhan to Hubei prefecture-level city home on the highway. I guess these actions on the Internet is to be scolded to death, I do not agree but I have no right to refute. After 9:00 a.m. , I went to the balcony to hang my clothes, and I saw the gas station across from my house. Many cars were waiting in line for gas. After half an hour, I went back to see it again. The line was getting longer and longer. According to my observation, the line didn't end until two or three in the afternoon.

"closed city" on the day, home opposite the gas station, private cars queue up for gas
Also on that day, the parents-in-law refused our advice and insisted on returning to their hometown in a small town in Hubei. According to their idea, they must burn paper and set off firecrackers for their ancestors in the new year. Fortunately, however, they have been home to the town in a state of self-isolation, and then the village road was blocked, traffic is not, worship of the ancestors did not come.
By 6:00 pm, the mobile phone map of Wuhan exports are basically closed, my husband and I suddenly want to drive out to see what is now the state of big Wuhan. We plan to walk the two ring streets of Florida -- on the Erqi Bridge of the Yingwuzhou Bridge. After going out, occasionally come across an electric car, the neighborhood near the supermarket has been closed.
The XIONGCHU viaduct, which has always had a large traffic flow, is usually deserted at about two or three o'clock in the morning. On both sides of the road, a little over half of the lights in the residential buildings are on. All the shops are closed except the drugstore and the convenience store. You can see through the window that many of the shelves in the convenience store are empty. At night, the city seems to be asleep.
We crossed the bridge and headed to Hankou. Outside the window, it was raining. At this time of year, the lights on both sides of the river were on. Now it was pitch black. Maybe it's because I see all the new flats that haven't been here long, and cars are entering the Hankou area, and only a few houses in a building can be seen with their lights on.
Along the way, my husband and I are in low spirits. Instead, the child was so excited that he sweated profusely in the car. I immediately get nervous, if the child is sick at this moment to the hospital, very troublesome. Fortunately, the baby is doing well.
At 8:00 p.m. , we went home, and it was hard. We discussed how the Wuhan Economy in the thoroughfare of nine provinces would be affected after the disaster, and how much effort and time it would take to restore the status quo ante.
January 24th, New Year's Eve, day two of the siege. In the morning, my child woke me up. In my dream, the new pneumonia was getting worse and worse. I could only vaguely remember that I didn't know where I was or where I was going.
After getting up, open the window, downstairs empty, very quiet, only occasionally can see pedestrians carrying full shopping bags hurried past. The New Year's Eve dinner was cooked with a few simple dishes. After New Year's Eve dinner, we watched the Korean movie "Flu" . I didn't feel any more scared after seeing it, because our reality is so much better than in the movies.
January 25th, the first day of the first lunar month, the third day of "closing the city" . At noon, my friend in Wuhan sent me a message saying that she was bored to death at home alone. I want to invite her to our house to play, but on second thought is not appropriate, also can only persuade her online fight a landlord or so.
These days, my husband and I do nothing on the news, watching the increase in cases, almost all of the cases across the country and wuhan-related, comments are blaming Wuhan people running around. In fact, this is unfair to many people who have left Wuhan.
As a megacity in the Central Plain region, Wuhan has a large migrant population. In my hometown of Xinyang in Henan Province, there are many people who come to Wuhan for work. The number of college students in Wuhan has exceeded one million. College students and a lot of them left before it got ugly.
A neighbor from my neighborhood, a family of four, returned to their hometown in Anhui Province for the Spring Festival on Jan. 20. A few days back, they began to be glad to have left the dangerous area of Wuhan, to be afraid to let relatives come to their home, they dare not go out. After suffering for several days, they returned to Wuhan from Anhui Province on the third day of the city closure.
In the afternoon, we read about a possible ban on motor vehicles in Wuhan. Hubby has to pick up a delivery. Jd.com hasn't delivered in two days. They sent me a message saying they could pick it up. Our adult problem is easy to solve, but the child wants to drink milk powder, want to use diapers, have to stock. "closed city" days do not know how long, courier can not come to the door, for the long-term dependence on E-commerce, it is a little uncomfortable. JD.com warehouse is full, they only have a staff member to stay there, the husband turned over a long time, also only picked up a few pieces, fortunately, milk powder is picked up.
January 26th, the second day of the first lunar month, the fourth day of the "closure of the city" . Still every day until the early hours of the news, still sleeping about Wuhan pneumonia all kinds of dreams. Our kids also sleep late every day, and basically wake up just before noon, which is good, because we eat two meals a day.
January 27th, the third day of the first lunar month, the fifth day of the "closure of the city" . When I woke up, Koby was gone, and the world had become a little more magical. Wechat friends sent a message, we do not have enough stock, have come out to buy, the supermarket vegetable prices are normal but have been snapped up, diaper broken code. And then I'm GONNA figure out how much longer I can keep a baby's diaper on.

January 27th, the third day of the first lunar month, the fifth day of the "closure of the city" . When I woke up, Koby was gone, and the world had become a little more magical. Wechat friends sent a message, we do not have enough stock, have come out to buy, the supermarket vegetable prices are normal but have been snapped up, diaper broken code. And then I'm GONNA figure out how much longer I can keep a baby's diaper on.

I am from Xinyang, Henan Province. I studied in Wuhan. After graduation, I stayed in Wuhan. Now I live in Hongshan District. I am the mother of a 1-year-old child. Wuhan is the epicenter of the outbreak, and its hometown, Xinyang, is close to the city and is now the focus of the investigation.

On January 20, three days before the "closure" of the city, Academician Zhong Nanshan mentioned the existence of human-to-human transmission of new coronary pneumonia. I just watched the news for a little while, and I didn't panic. Since the number of reported cases was low and the death rate low, my response to the incident was somewhat delayed due to a fluke. Probably also from the 20th, Wuhan became the focus of the public, and panic began to breed.

On January 21, a friend in the neighborhood sent me a message reminding me not to run around with my children. The streets were covered with masks. But two days ago when we were in the vicinity of Hoida when no one is wearing a mask, may be the role of the academician appeal, we began to pay attention to up. Our property response is also relatively timely, the same day on the elevator for disinfection. Later, the elevator keys are covered with plastic wrap, a day to change.

In fact, we have avoided taking our children to crowded places and have not had close contact with others since mid December, when Wuhan was hit by the flu and many primary schools and kindergartens were closed. Friends also told me that n95 masks at the nearby pharmacy cost 58 yuan each. I quickly inventory the home mask, N95 there are about 10, disposable masks 220, I think these masks should be enough. At this point, I wasn't panicking. I just thought everything was fine.

The masks we had in the house

On the 22nd, the day before the city was shut down, the fear of pneumonia in Wuhan was growing. I see a lot of news in the circle of friends: A friend because of Wuhan ID card was unbooked hotel, a friend to go home through Wuhan Station feel panic, a friend to change the ticket not to transfer from Wuhan, a friend to return the ticket from Wuhan home.

That's when I realized things weren't as rosy as I'd hoped. We cancelled our shopping trip to the supermarket. At night, I repeatedly brush the news about Wuhan Pneumonia, until two or three o'clock in the morning, the network Wuhan "closed city" sound a lot. I'm scared. Although subconsciously I felt that the possibility of an extreme situation was small, I was still afraid that the situation would worsen, that there would be a shortage of daily necessities or that prices would be bid up. To be safe, I bought a lot of milk powder and diapers online, and some raw, praying that my order still gets delivered.

January 23 at 5:00 am, just fell asleep less than two hours, I was the baby's Hum wakened, to the baby after the milk, I opened a micro-blog to see, the brain suddenly confused, really "closed city" ? Although these two days as the matter ferments, my husband and I also discussed Wuhan will not be "closed city" problem, but the conclusion is very unlikely. Wuhan as one of the National Transportation Hubs, "City closure" after the impact, how to do residents' lives?

Calm down, I also feel at the moment, "closed city" is perhaps the most reasonable arrangement. But what about our lives? That's my biggest concern right now. I wonder if everyone will go out to grab food at first light, if prices will soar. I opened the e-commerce site, the price is normal, and under two single fresh, regardless of whether it can be delivered, finally a little peace of mind.

After placing the order, I woke up my husband and told him the news of the "closure" . He was still in a daze, and I tried not to panic. My husband slowed down a few seconds, with just woke up the nasal voice back to me: "Or 'closed city' . ".

When he came to, he looked at the map, and the road was clear. 'If I want to go back to my hometown in Henan, this is my last chance, ' he said. 'If I want to go, I'll go now. '. I refused, I do not want to go back to trouble home, now go back to oneself and others are a test.

Our main problem is the means of subsistence. At 6:30 in the morning, my husband set off for Zhongbai Supermarket. The supermarket was not open yet, but there were many people waiting at the gate of the supermarket. 8:30, the husband purchase back, I looked, cabbage 1.99 yuan a catty, potatoes 2.99 yuan a catty, are still the normal price. But that morning Wuhan food prices went up on Weibo. We're just glad we made our move this morning. In fact, the price of food is basically normal, the price of the net pass the supermarket is also talked about.

Food for the siege

We took stock of the family's supplies, living two or three months is enough, that is, vegetables to regularly go shopping.

For the moment, nothing happened. We followed the traffic in Wuhan through the map APP, and watched as the traffic conditions on several out-of-town lanes slowly changed from green to red. Friends Circle, some friends in the traffic jam left Wuhan to Hubei prefecture-level city home on the highway. I guess these actions on the Internet is to be scolded to death, I do not agree but I have no right to refute. After 9:00 a.m. , I went to the balcony to hang my clothes, and I saw the gas station across from my house. Many cars were waiting in line for gas. After half an hour, I went back to see it again. The line was getting longer and longer. According to my observation, the line didn't end until two or three in the afternoon.

"closed city" on the day, home opposite the gas station, private cars queue up for gas

Also on that day, the parents-in-law refused our advice and insisted on returning to their hometown in a small town in Hubei. According to their idea, they must burn paper and set off firecrackers for their ancestors in the new year. Fortunately, however, they have been home to the town in a state of self-isolation, and then the village road was blocked, traffic is not, worship of the ancestors did not come.

By 6:00 pm, the mobile phone map of Wuhan exports are basically closed, my husband and I suddenly want to drive out to see what is now the state of big Wuhan. We plan to walk the two ring streets of Florida -- on the Erqi Bridge of the Yingwuzhou Bridge. After going out, occasionally come across an electric car, the neighborhood near the supermarket has been closed.

The XIONGCHU viaduct, which has always had a large traffic flow, is usually deserted at about two or three o'clock in the morning. On both sides of the road, a little over half of the lights in the residential buildings are on. All the shops are closed except the drugstore and the convenience store. You can see through the window that many of the shelves in the convenience store are empty. At night, the city seems to be asleep.

We crossed the bridge and headed to Hankou. Outside the window, it was raining. At this time of year, the lights on both sides of the river were on. Now it was pitch black. Maybe it's because I see all the new flats that haven't been here long, and cars are entering the Hankou area, and only a few houses in a building can be seen with their lights on.

Along the way, my husband and I are in low spirits. Instead, the child was so excited that he sweated profusely in the car. I immediately get nervous, if the child is sick at this moment to the hospital, very troublesome. Fortunately, the baby is doing well.

At 8:00 p.m. , we went home, and it was hard. We discussed how the Wuhan Economy in the thoroughfare of nine provinces would be affected after the disaster, and how much effort and time it would take to restore the status quo ante.

January 24th, New Year's Eve, day two of the siege. In the morning, my child woke me up. In my dream, the new pneumonia was getting worse and worse. I could only vaguely remember that I didn't know where I was or where I was going.

After getting up, open the window, downstairs empty, very quiet, only occasionally can see pedestrians carrying full shopping bags hurried past. The New Year's Eve dinner was cooked with a few simple dishes. After New Year's Eve dinner, we watched the Korean movie "Flu" . I didn't feel any more scared after seeing it, because our reality is so much better than in the movies.

January 25th, the first day of the first lunar month, the third day of "closing the city" . At noon, my friend in Wuhan sent me a message saying that she was bored to death at home alone. I want to invite her to our house to play, but on second thought is not appropriate, also can only persuade her online fight a landlord or so.

These days, my husband and I do nothing on the news, watching the increase in cases, almost all of the cases across the country and wuhan-related, comments are blaming Wuhan people running around. In fact, this is unfair to many people who have left Wuhan.

As a megacity in the Central Plain region, Wuhan has a large migrant population. In my hometown of Xinyang in Henan Province, there are many people who come to Wuhan for work. The number of college students in Wuhan has exceeded one million. College students and a lot of them left before it got ugly.

A neighbor from my neighborhood, a family of four, returned to their hometown in Anhui Province for the Spring Festival on Jan. 20. A few days back, they began to be glad to have left the dangerous area of Wuhan, to be afraid to let relatives come to their home, they dare not go out. After suffering for several days, they returned to Wuhan from Anhui Province on the third day of the city closure.

In the afternoon, we read about a possible ban on motor vehicles in Wuhan. Hubby has to pick up a delivery. Jd.com hasn't delivered in two days. They sent me a message saying they could pick it up. Our adult problem is easy to solve, but the child wants to drink milk powder, want to use diapers, have to stock. "closed city" days do not know how long, courier can not come to the door, for the long-term dependence on E-commerce, it is a little uncomfortable. JD.com warehouse is full, they only have a staff member to stay there, the husband turned over a long time, also only picked up a few pieces, fortunately, milk powder is picked up.

January 26th, the second day of the first lunar month, the fourth day of the "closure of the city" . Still every day until the early hours of the news, still sleeping about Wuhan pneumonia all kinds of dreams. Our kids also sleep late every day, and basically wake up just before noon, which is good, because we eat two meals a day.

January 27th, the third day of the first lunar month, the fifth day of the "closure of the city" . When I woke up, Koby was gone, and the world had become a little more magical.
