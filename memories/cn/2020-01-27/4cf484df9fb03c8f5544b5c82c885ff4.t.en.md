In this context, it is urgent to integrate the resources of the industrial chain and coordinate operations. After all, there is only so much you can do on your own, and every role in the chain is critical.

Blue Sail Medical Initiative, including the company, most of the domestic manufacturers of protective products have been in the emergency mask, gloves, protective clothing, goggles, disinfectant wipes, disinfectant production, but due to the sudden increase in demand, supplies are still tight. To this end, has been urgently contacted for a long time with the company has close business relations with a number of foreign suppliers and distributors of Protective Supplies, as soon as possible to organize the source of supply to the epidemic area to send the aforementioned urgently needed protective supplies at fair prices.

"At this particular moment, we should build a 'community of destiny' for China's pharmaceutical protection industry, where the law is to ensure (supply) at a fair price, " Liu Wenjing said.

The "brothers" in the industrial chain are also "hugging each other to give warmth" .

When the staff of Rizhao huanyu Paper Products Co. , Ltd. heard that Sanqi medical insurance needed packing boxes for medical protection products, they rushed back to the factory to start the production line and worked overtime to produce 100,000 packing boxes to be matched.

In this context, it is urgent to integrate the resources of the industrial chain and coordinate operations. After all, there is only so much you can do on your own, and every role in the chain is critical.

Blue Sail Medical Initiative, including the company, most of the domestic manufacturers of protective products have been in the emergency mask, gloves, protective clothing, goggles, disinfectant wipes, disinfectant production, but due to the sudden increase in demand, supplies are still tight. To this end, has been urgently contacted for a long time with the company has close business relations with a number of foreign suppliers and distributors of Protective Supplies, as soon as possible to organize the source of supply to the epidemic area to send the aforementioned urgently needed protective supplies at fair prices.

"At this particular moment, we should build a 'community of destiny' for China's pharmaceutical protection industry, where the law is to ensure (supply) at a fair price, " Liu Wenjing said.

As the above two enterprises have previously done export orders, and many export orders production date has been scheduled. Faced with the spread of the epidemic, in order to supply the domestic market, the two companies said that priority to ensure domestic orders, overtime to meet domestic demand.

Lanfan medical, for example, has cut a line from its automated production system since the night of January 23 to ensure it can deliver one million gloves to Wuhan on New Year's Eve.

It is reported that this production line daily capacity of 850,000, are the highest level of protection aql 1.5 products.

The Blue Sail medical treatment, the three strange medical insurance is not only this.

For example, as the world's largest mask producer, China's industrial chain's maximum daily production capacity of more than 20 million. The latest survey data from the industry shows that up to now, more than 30 domestic enterprises have resumed production, production capacity to restore more than 40% of the normal day, the output reached more than 8 million per day.

Although the leaders of Sanqi Medical Insurance Enterprises have expressed confidence in ensuring market supply, up to now, as 30 provincial-level jurisdictions in China have launched a first-level response to major public health emergencies one after another, it is an indisputable fact that medical protective products such as face masks are facing a huge gap.

In JD.com, for example, the E-COMMERCE company said it had sold 126m masks between January 19 and 22, a 48-fold increase from the previous day.

It's just a profile. Media reports show that in many cities, masks out of stock is very common, especially KN95, N95 masks, is "a mask difficult to find. ". At the same time, the local hospital in Wuhan, medical protection materials for the public notice frequently; National Medical Materials Deployment Action..

On the one hand, the market is facing a huge gap; on the other hand, for a number of manufacturers of medical protective products, including Sanqi Medical Insurance and Lanfan medical care, if they want to solve the shortage of medical protective products in the short term, they still face a production cycle, manpower, material shortage and transportation cost rise and other practical problems.

In this context, it is urgent to integrate the resources of the industrial chain and coordinate operations. After all, there is only so much you can do on your own, and every role in the chain is critical.

Blue Sail Medical Initiative, including the company, most of the domestic manufacturers of protective products have been in the emergency mask, gloves, protective clothing, goggles, disinfectant wipes, disinfectant production, but due to the sudden increase in demand, supplies are still tight.
