For Wang Ning, an ordinary moviegoer, the 2020 Spring Festival is a "flip-flop and flip-flop" .

On the morning of Jan. 23, he bought advance tickets for the films lost and Jiang Ziya through a ticketing APP. Ten hours later, less than 20 hours before the official start of the Spring Festival Festival, seven films originally scheduled for release during the festival were pulled as the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic spread. Wang Ning, along with the countless moviegoers who have contributed 402 million yuan in advance ticket sales for this year's Spring Festival, lost the chance to go to the cinema on the first day of the Lunar New Year.

The next day, on Jan. 24, the official Weibo Account of the film and Director Xu Zheng announced that the film would be broadcast free of charge on short video platforms such as jitter and watermelon videos. There's a new movie on, and it's free -- a move that, according to a subsequent vote by Sina Entertainment, has apparently been welcomed by the average moviegoer. In a poll of more than 700,000 people, 458,000 voted for the "never before, Xu Zheng Rocks! " Option. Wang Ning also voted for it.

January 25, the first day of the Lunar New Year. After lunch, he called his parents and sat down in front of the TV to watch "Orong Ma, " which was projected onto the screen by his phone. Fifteen minutes into the film, the three of us are on our way to Florida for the third time, finding it difficult to enjoy a movie without the atmosphere of the theater and sitting in our bright living room. One by one, they went to take a nap after finding that neither of them wanted to continue.

Wang is not the only one whose attitude to a film can change three times in a few days. After two weeks on the air, lost's Douban rating finally fell to 5.9, less than 80 percent of comedies. Of all Xu Zheng's films, mama is only 0.2 points higher than the bottom of the heap -- on the assumption that free viewing has already won some viewers over.

One comment, which received 6,300 likes, said rudely: "I kind of understand why they sell vertical screens at premieres... real offline shows get beaten up a lot at the same time. "

For the average Moviegoer, a 126 minute movie and a few tens of dollars worth of tickets wouldn't have mattered. But beyond the film, the mother of lost causes a bigger stir.

Chen Yan, an industry insider who has been distributing films and TV shows for years, has a sharper sense of smell than the average viewer, although she, like others, saw the news when she was watching it on the news. Her first reaction was that she was "too smart" : Since she couldn't release the film on time, Hengdian Film and Television had to "fail" to guarantee the bottom line of "lost mom, " but found a byte to beat, the copyright is sold at sky-high prices, so from a business point of view, it won't lose money, and because of the free brand, the Folk word-of-mouth will certainly win out. Then she began to lament the 630 million yuan agreement signed by bytedance and joy media, "too willing to destroy the brand, this big deal, than Douyin's 20 billion red envelope influence. " On second thought, "The theater must be going crazy. "

Chen Yan's judgment is accurate. On the night of Jan. 24, the Zhejiang Film Industry Association, which includes Hengdian, issued a statement in which the decision was defined as "an act that breaks the basic rules of the industry. ". At about the same time, Zeng Maojun, chief executive of Wanda, which is also in charge of the Spring Festival film Detective Chinatown 3, said in a statement to the media: "cinemas will go to cinemas unless they are big movies on the Internet. "

A cinema chain's move from a final cut to a release was supposed to be a tripartite effort: The producer was responsible for making the film, the distributor was responsible for selling it to theaters, and the theater chain was responsible for providing the equipment and showing it.

In accordance with the provisions of the measures for the administration of the collection and use of the special funds for the development of the national film industry, after payment of taxes and fees, 57%-59% of the box office belongs to the cinema line, 40%-42% to the producer, and 1%-3% to the distributor. This means that, generally speaking, the biggest financial beneficiary of a good-money theatrical film is the cinema. The operation of "mom, " the direct hollowing out of this part of the income cinema line.

A studio production manager in his zhihu answer, the analogy explains the fury of the Movie Theater Industry: "The national film industry, whether the theater or the propaganda side, and Xu Zheng team to fight the world, swear on Mount Tai, share the world. ". I gave you soldiers, supplies, weapons, to help you fight down, and now the world, you said that I have nothing to do, with an airborne what not to contribute points. Tell me, is this a Perfidy?"

Cinema chains are not happy with the film. On the afternoon of January 20, the film's official Weibo Account announced that it would be up for release until Lunar New Year's Eve. "It's almost new year, everyone wants to meet mom ahead of time to meet you! "

The tone of the comments below the post was in stark contrast to the "free to air" broadcast four days later by the official propaganda. The best reviews were almost always from studio staff: "Can't go home to see your mom on New Year's Eve, forced to stay at the movie theater to watch other people's moms? "

Jixiang is the general manager of a film studio in central Beijing, "A lot of films have been filed before in order to get word of mouth, but this is not the way it should be filed. About a month ago, everyone knew that on the New Year's Day the unification. The audience also bought the first day of the tickets, waiting to see that day. "Mama Jiong" in Beijing and other first-tier cities do roadshows, the cinema for the quality of the film itself has control, film scheduling and what are arranged. And according to past experience, New Year's Eve at four or five o'clock in the afternoon, will allow employees to go home early to take care of the feelings of everyone. As a result, a lot of theaters don't know what to do, and neither do they, nor do they."

Zhao has been in cinema for 14 years and is now the general manager of a cinema in eastern China. In his view, causing employees to work overtime temporarily, unable to go home for New Year's Eve dinner, just the film side suddenly file the consequences of one of the least. "The core of the problem is not overtime. If there is business, who wouldn't do it? But this [ filing ] is a game-changer. "

Even before the outbreak, the 2020 Lunar New Year holiday was different from previous years. On January 15,10 days before the first day of the Lunar New Year, pre-sales of the Spring Festival stalls still had not started. In contrast, in previous years, the pre-sale time of the Spring Festival stalls opened earlier, all the films at the same time to open publicity, the market has sufficient warm-up time, the audience will be more enthusiastic about the film. This year, according to Zhao, "No pre-sales were allowed. We waited and procrastinated. The final rule was seven days in advance, which was already very tight. "

During the Spring Festival, the consumer mentality of the audience is different from that of ordinary holidays. With the "big New Year" mentality, most consumers will not account for higher than usual movie ticket prices. "What you see is the impact of the Spring Festival on the entire box office. That is, those seven days may account for about 9 percent of all box office receipts in the whole country. In fact, it depends on the entire Spring Festival period. In a month's time, it should account for more than 20 percent of all box office receipts in the country, " Zhao said.

The studio, where Jixiang is located, originally gave Jiong ma 15% of the film's ticket sales, with an estimated box office of 1.5-2 billion yuan. At the end of the movie, their expectations of the box office were lowered. According to his judgment, if the Spring Festival release schedule, the box office of mom and Jiang Ziya should be about the same, behind Detective Chinatown 3 and the winner.

According to the cat's eye professional edition, as of January 20, lost mom had 25,216,600 yuan in pre sales, ranking behind Tang 3 and Jiang Ziya and the best Tang 3, with 154,553,400 yuan, that's six times more than lost mom.

Advance schedule, for an additional day of box office, is the then "lost mom" can play both dangerous and effective a card. But the odds are against us, and an epidemic has thrown everything out of whack.

Jixiang had been watching the news, and from January 20, when the situation became serious, he thought it might happen. So on the 23rd, after seven films were withdrawn, he was not too surprised. He can only extrapolate the losses from past years: from the 30th to the 6th day of the Lunar New Year, the loss of revenue for a single studio is about 2 million yuan.

Zhao Yang thinks, the chain reaction that epidemic situation creates, in a certain degree"saved"lost mother. "operationally, I fully understand that this is a last resort, not a clever one. Without this outbreak, the movie itself would have been badly beaten. "

PULL FILE, sell copyright, free broadcast, one operation down, happy media and bytecode beat won the favor of passersby, but also in the industry has been resisted. One of the refraction, not only the general audience for the film and Television Industry does not understand, but also the traditional film and the Internet has long-standing love to kill each other.

The battle over cinema's short video platform is the most extraordinary example of what it meant to be an unanticipated epidemic. But before this, the theater line movie "The ticket makes up" the war and the new media copyright dispute, also experienced the long-term tugging.

From the summer holiday in 2014 to the Spring Festival in 2018, the internet-triggered "ticket compensation" that lasted nearly four years has rewritten box office history for a while.

The average ticket price for a movie was 42.9 yuan around 2010, while ticket prices at the movie's Front desk ranged from 60 to 120 yuan, according to the data.

It was a time when cinema was not yet mass consumption. When "Avatar" was released, Xinmin had once conducted a poll on its triple-digit ticket prices, with 69 percent of the participants saying, "you have to be sick to get such expensive tickets. " But according to Chen Yan's recollection, the 3d effect has an unprecedented impact on the audience, or "want to kneel. ".

When Jixiang was still in college, he was a film buff. Almost every week he goes to the cinema to see a movie. A movie ticket is a lot of money for a student. "At that time, there were not many restaurants in multiplex, so we had to rush to buy tickets and grab good seats. There were also many scalpers and scalpers. It was very cool to get good tickets, good seats and cheap tickets through the cinema connection. "

In the summer of 2014, when Transformers: Age of Extinction was released, online ticket sales platforms for the first time heavily subsidized movie ticket prices. In its first week, the cat's eye film grossed 4.5 million dollars -- more than 30 percent of the box office. For $9.90, viewers can sit in a theater and watch a 3 D blockbuster, which is more than can be said for the free screening of lost mom today.

The seemingly win-win "ticket supplement" , has created the domestic box office market carnival. In 2015, China's box office rose 45 percent from the previous year, taking in 44 billion yuan for the whole year and 4 billion yuan for e-commerce. In 2016, the annual box office reached 45.712 billion yuan, while the size of e-commerce ticket sales shrank to 1.5 billion yuan. Another year later, the main source of ticket spending shifted from online platforms to film studios: In 2017, the annual ticket spending exceeded 2 billion yuan, of which 1.2 billion yuan was spent by film studios.

The audience in 9.9 yuan, 19.9 yuan low price concessions, to develop the habit of going to the cinema to see a movie, but out of their own pocket to compensate the film side is miserable. No tickets means no scheduling, no box office. Wang Zhonglei, CEO of Huayi brothers, said at the 2018 Film Investment Summit Forum that the ticket payment was an unnecessary huge expense, but "if you do not pay, I will tell you friends there to fill the amount of money, you do not fill the words, the cinema does not give you pomp and circumstance" .

At about the same time, Internet film companies have triggered a surge in the price of film rights. In 2010, the exclusive online rights to let the bullets fly sold for $5 million, and four years later, the exclusive online rights to Jiang Wen's gone with the bullets shot up to $30 million.

Crazy arms race subsidies ended in 2018. That year's Spring Festival file, "limit ticket fill" regulation issued, no one can buy less than 19.9 yuan of film tickets.

For producers, the benefits are almost immediate. Chinese films made 60 billion yuan in 2018, setting a new box office record, of which "I am not a drug God" and "nobody" , which cost no more than 60 million yuan, contributed 3.9 billion yuan in total. Small Budget, small production of the film works, finally ushered in their spring.

From 2014 to the present, audiences have gone from the surprise of a 9.9 yuan movie ticket, to readjusting to a few tens of yuan ticket, to learning to pay online to watch the real version, and experienced a similar journey of "reversal and reversal and reversal" .

When audiences finally get used to paying for the legitimate content, the online short video platform for mom makes people wonder whether the simultaneous streaming of movies online and offline will become a new trend? Can An epidemic change an industry?

Almost all of the industry respondents said they were not optimistic. Chen Yan believes that the effects of different window periods are superimposed. large-scale movies go to cinemas first and then to the Internet after release, which is an accepted way to maximize profits. "artificial reduction of window period, direct webcasting, does not create greater value. "

Chen Yan has feelings about movies, just like most people in the film and Television Industry. "Film is 100 years old. When television developed, did the film die? It didn't die. When dvds developed, did the film die? It didn't die either. Video sites haven't been around for a year or two. The film hasn't died. "

Zhao is even sceptical about the brand impact that happy media and bytedance could have together. In the field of long video, tencent, Youku and Iqiyi have been competing for a long time, burning money for a long time, bytecode beat down 600 million buy advertising, whether it can cause a sudden breakthrough? "First, did you get that much traffic? Second, did you keep the traffic after that? It's not as easy as you think to change the market. "

From a technical point of view, the quality of a home theater can not catch up with that of a theater: "even if your TV is 120 inches, you don't have 7.1 channels; even if your TV is 240 inches, you don't have IMAX. "

The unique properties of offline viewing can not yet be replaced by online playback on the Internet. "modern people go to the cinema not just to see stories, but to see stories with others, " Zhao said.

Each interviewee described online movie watching as a battle between the movies and the MINUTIAE OF LIFE: Watching for a while, picking up the phone to play with, watching for a while, pausing to go to the bathroom. There is no immersive viewing scene, no concentration in the dark, and the viewing experience available as the audience itself is discounted.

Going to the cinema to see a film is still a hard-to-replace form of entertainment. Image / visual China

From this point of view, Chen Yan a bit for the word-of-mouth crying injustice. In mid-january, she attended a film festival, and when she saw the film, she felt well shot, full of emotion, and even cried several times, although she also felt that "there was a very clear logical place where it didn't make sense. ". It was the theater scene, she concluded, that amplified the audience's experience. "We Chinese, more reserved, in the cinema, you can go to tears, you say you watch at home, in the living room crying, the people watching you, you will be embarrassed, your mood will be suppressed, and then you will not feel so good. "

The film industry itself has changed a lot since the advent of technology. Zhao cites the example of Netflix, an Internet company that was born in 1997, despite its reputation as a producer of "Netflix products. " Still, it can not escape the essence of its origins: An online video rental provider.

Three years after its creation, Netflix has developed a recommendation algorithm that can recommend "what might be of interest" to users based on their browsing history. This now familiar set of beliefs, used and perfected by almost every short video platform, is Netflix's greatest weapon in its expansion.

This data driven model is seen by many as a radical departure from traditional film content production. The former CEO  of paramount and Fox, the current chairmen of IAC and Expedia, even went so far as to say on the show, "Hollywood doesn't matter now. "

Zhao Yang disagrees. Small Budget Film Rome, which won best director, Best Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Cinematography at last year's Academy Awards, did not make Rome available on Netflix's wide release, it was just the beginning of a three week mini screening to shock Oscar. Zhao Yang analysis, in the final analysis is because if large-scale hospital line, investment and income is not proportional to the online network, the introduction of paid membership to watch, then more benefits.

After "mother lost, " the same period of withdrawal of the film has not made online video site position. With Valentine's Day looming and the epidemic still raging, most of the offline studios remain closed, and Oscar films such as Jojo's world of fantasy and little women have been pulled. After winning the reputation of passers-by and offending their peers in the industry, "lost mom" may be the only "winner" this month.

When audiences finally get used to paying for the legitimate content, the online short video platform for mom makes people wonder whether the simultaneous streaming of movies online and offline will become a new trend? Can An epidemic change an industry?

Almost all of the industry respondents said they were not optimistic. Chen Yan believes that the effects of different window periods are superimposed. large-scale movies go to cinemas first and then to the Internet after release, which is an accepted way to maximize profits. "artificial reduction of window period, direct webcasting, does not create greater value. "

Chen Yan has feelings about movies, just like most people in the film and Television Industry. "Film is 100 years old. When television developed, did the film die? It didn't die. When dvds developed, did the film die? It didn't die either. Video sites haven't been around for a year or two. The film hasn't died. "

Zhao is even sceptical about the brand impact that happy media and bytedance could have together. In the field of long video, tencent, Youku and Iqiyi have been competing for a long time, burning money for a long time, bytecode beat down 600 million buy advertising, whether it can cause a sudden breakthrough? "First, did you get that much traffic? Second, did you keep the traffic after that? It's not as easy as you think to change the market. "

From a technical point of view, the quality of a home theater can not catch up with that of a theater: "even if your TV is 120 inches, you don't have 7.1 channels; even if your TV is 240 inches, you don't have IMAX. "

The unique properties of offline viewing can not yet be replaced by online playback on the Internet. "modern people go to the cinema not just to see stories, but to see stories with others, " Zhao said.

Each interviewee described online movie watching as a battle between the movies and the MINUTIAE OF LIFE: Watching for a while, picking up the phone to play with, watching for a while, pausing to go to the bathroom. There is no immersive viewing scene, no concentration in the dark, and the viewing experience available as the audience itself is discounted.

From this point of view, Chen Yan a bit for the word-of-mouth crying injustice. In mid-january, she attended a film festival, and when she saw the film, she felt well shot, full of emotion, and even cried several times, although she also felt that "there was a very clear logical place where it didn't make sense. ". It was the theater scene, she concluded, that amplified the audience's experience. "We Chinese, more reserved, in the cinema, you can go to tears, you say you watch at home, in the living room crying, the people watching you, you will be embarrassed, your mood will be suppressed, and then you will not feel so good. "

The film industry itself has changed a lot since the advent of technology. Zhao cites the example of Netflix, an Internet company that was born in 1997, despite its reputation as a producer of "Netflix products. " Still, it can not escape the essence of its origins: An online video rental provider.

Three years after its creation, Netflix has developed a recommendation algorithm that can recommend "what might be of interest" to users based on their browsing history. This now familiar set of beliefs, used and perfected by almost every short video platform, is Netflix's greatest weapon in its expansion.

This data driven model is seen by many as a radical departure from traditional film content production. The former CEO  of paramount and Fox, the current chairmen of IAC and Expedia, even went so far as to say on the show, "Hollywood doesn't matter now. "

Zhao Yang disagrees. Small Budget Film Rome, which won best director, Best Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Cinematography at last year's Academy Awards, did not make Rome available on Netflix's wide release, it was just the beginning of a three week mini screening to shock Oscar. Zhao Yang analysis, in the final analysis is because if large-scale hospital line, investment and income is not proportional to the online network, the introduction of paid membership to watch, then more benefits.

After "mother lost, " the same period of withdrawal of the film has not made online video site position. With Valentine's Day looming and the epidemic still raging, most of the offline studios remain closed, and Oscar films such as Jojo's world of fantasy and little women have been pulled. After winning the reputation of passers-by and offending their peers in the industry, "lost mom" may be the only "winner" this month.

For Wang Ning, an ordinary moviegoer, the 2020 Spring Festival is a "flip-flop and flip-flop" .

On the morning of Jan. 23, he bought advance tickets for the films lost and Jiang Ziya through a ticketing APP. Ten hours later, less than 20 hours before the official start of the Spring Festival Festival, seven films originally scheduled for release during the festival were pulled as the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic spread. Wang Ning, along with the countless moviegoers who have contributed 402 million yuan in advance ticket sales for this year's Spring Festival, lost the chance to go to the cinema on the first day of the Lunar New Year.

The next day, on Jan. 24, the official Weibo Account of the film and Director Xu Zheng announced that the film would be broadcast free of charge on short video platforms such as jitter and watermelon videos. There's a new movie on, and it's free -- a move that, according to a subsequent vote by Sina Entertainment, has apparently been welcomed by the average moviegoer. In a poll of more than 700,000 people, 458,000 voted for the "never before, Xu Zheng Rocks! " Option. Wang Ning also voted for it.

January 25, the first day of the Lunar New Year. After lunch, he called his parents and sat down in front of the TV to watch "Orong Ma, " which was projected onto the screen by his phone. Fifteen minutes into the film, the three of us are on our way to Florida for the third time, finding it difficult to enjoy a movie without the atmosphere of the theater and sitting in our bright living room. One by one, they went to take a nap after finding that neither of them wanted to continue.

Wang is not the only one whose attitude to a film can change three times in a few days. After two weeks on the air, lost's Douban rating finally fell to 5.9, less than 80 percent of comedies. Of all Xu Zheng's films, mama is only 0.2 points higher than the bottom of the heap -- on the assumption that free viewing has already won some viewers over.

One comment, which received 6,300 likes, said rudely: "I kind of understand why they sell vertical screens at premieres... real offline shows get beaten up a lot at the same time. "

For the average Moviegoer, a 126 minute movie and a few tens of dollars worth of tickets wouldn't have mattered. But beyond the film, the mother of lost causes a bigger stir.

Chen Yan, an industry insider who has been distributing films and TV shows for years, has a sharper sense of smell than the average viewer, although she, like others, saw the news when she was watching it on the news. Her first reaction was that she was "too smart" : Since she couldn't release the film on time, Hengdian Film and Television had to "fail" to guarantee the bottom line of "lost mom, " but found a byte to beat, the copyright is sold at sky-high prices, so from a business point of view, it won't lose money, and because of the free brand, the Folk word-of-mouth will certainly win out. Then she began to lament the 630 million yuan agreement signed by bytedance and joy media, "too willing to destroy the brand, this big deal, than Douyin's 20 billion red envelope influence. " On second thought, "The theater must be going crazy. "

Chen Yan's judgment is accurate. On the night of Jan. 24, the Zhejiang Film Industry Association, which includes Hengdian, issued a statement in which the decision was defined as "an act that breaks the basic rules of the industry. ". At about the same time, Zeng Maojun, chief executive of Wanda, which is also in charge of the Spring Festival film Detective Chinatown 3, said in a statement to the media: "cinemas will go to cinemas unless they are big movies on the Internet. "

A cinema chain's move from a final cut to a release was supposed to be a tripartite effort: The producer was responsible for making the film, the distributor was responsible for selling it to theaters, and the theater chain was responsible for providing the equipment and showing it.

In accordance with the provisions of the measures for the administration of the collection and use of the special funds for the development of the national film industry, after payment of taxes and fees, 57%-59% of the box office belongs to the cinema line, 40%-42% to the producer, and 1%-3% to the distributor. This means that, generally speaking, the biggest financial beneficiary of a good-money theatrical film is the cinema. The operation of "mom, " the direct hollowing out of this part of the income cinema line.

A studio production manager in his zhihu answer, the analogy explains the fury of the Movie Theater Industry: "The national film industry, whether the theater or the propaganda side, and Xu Zheng team to fight the world, swear on Mount Tai, share the world. ". I gave you soldiers, supplies, weapons, to help you fight down, and now the world, you said that I have nothing to do, with an airborne what not to contribute points. Tell me, is this a Perfidy?"

Cinema chains are not happy with the film. On the afternoon of January 20, the film's official Weibo Account announced that it would be up for release until Lunar New Year's Eve. "It's almost new year, everyone wants to meet mom ahead of time to meet you! "

The tone of the comments below the post was in stark contrast to the "free to air" broadcast four days later by the official propaganda. The best reviews were almost always from studio staff: "Can't go home to see your mom on New Year's Eve, forced to stay at the movie theater to watch other people's moms? "

Jixiang is the general manager of a film studio in central Beijing, "A lot of films have been filed before in order to get word of mouth, but this is not the way it should be filed. About a month ago, everyone knew that on the New Year's Day the unification. The audience also bought the first day of the tickets, waiting to see that day. "Mama Jiong" in Beijing and other first-tier cities do roadshows, the cinema for the quality of the film itself has control, film scheduling and what are arranged. And according to past experience, New Year's Eve at four or five o'clock in the afternoon, will allow employees to go home early to take care of the feelings of everyone. As a result, a lot of theaters don't know what to do, and neither do they, nor do they."

Zhao has been in cinema for 14 years and is now the general manager of a cinema in eastern China. In his view, causing employees to work overtime temporarily, unable to go home for New Year's Eve dinner, just the film side suddenly file the consequences of one of the least. "The core of the problem is not overtime. If there is business, who wouldn't do it? But this [ filing ] is a game-changer. "

Even before the outbreak, the 2020 Lunar New Year holiday was different from previous years. On January 15,10 days before the first day of the Lunar New Year, pre-sales of the Spring Festival stalls still had not started. In contrast, in previous years, the pre-sale time of the Spring Festival stalls opened earlier, all the films at the same time to open publicity, the market has sufficient warm-up time, the audience will be more enthusiastic about the film. This year, according to Zhao, "No pre-sales were allowed. We waited and procrastinated. The final rule was seven days in advance, which was already very tight. "

During the Spring Festival, the consumer mentality of the audience is different from that of ordinary holidays. With the "big New Year" mentality, most consumers will not account for higher than usual movie ticket prices. "What you see is the impact of the Spring Festival on the entire box office. That is, those seven days may account for about 9 percent of all box office receipts in the whole country. In fact, it depends on the entire Spring Festival period. In a month's time, it should account for more than 20 percent of all box office receipts in the country, " Zhao said.

The studio, where Jixiang is located, originally gave Jiong ma 15% of the film's ticket sales, with an estimated box office of 1.5-2 billion yuan. At the end of the movie, their expectations of the box office were lowered. According to his judgment, if the Spring Festival release schedule, the box office of mom and Jiang Ziya should be about the same, behind Detective Chinatown 3 and the winner.

According to the cat's eye professional edition, as of January 20, lost mom had 25,216,600 yuan in pre sales, ranking behind Tang 3 and Jiang Ziya and the best Tang 3, with 154,553,400 yuan, that's six times more than lost mom.

Advance schedule, for an additional day of box office, is the then "lost mom" can play both dangerous and effective a card. But the odds are against us, and an epidemic has thrown everything out of whack.

Jixiang had been watching the news, and from January 20, when the situation became serious, he thought it might happen. So on the 23rd, after seven films were withdrawn, he was not too surprised. He can only extrapolate the losses from past years: from the 30th to the 6th day of the Lunar New Year, the loss of revenue for a single studio is about 2 million yuan.

Zhao Yang thinks, the chain reaction that epidemic situation creates, in a certain degree"saved"lost mother. "operationally, I fully understand that this is a last resort, not a clever one. Without this outbreak, the movie itself would have been badly beaten. "

The battle over cinema's short video platform is the most extraordinary example of what it meant to be an unanticipated epidemic. But before this, the theater line movie "The ticket makes up" the war and the new media copyright dispute, also experienced the long-term tugging.

From the summer holiday in 2014 to the Spring Festival in 2018, the internet-triggered "ticket compensation" that lasted nearly four years has rewritten box office history for a while.

The average ticket price for a movie was 42.9 yuan around 2010, while ticket prices at the movie's Front desk ranged from 60 to 120 yuan, according to the data.

It was a time when cinema was not yet mass consumption. When "Avatar" was released, Xinmin had once conducted a poll on its triple-digit ticket prices, with 69 percent of the participants saying, "you have to be sick to get such expensive tickets. " But according to Chen Yan's recollection, the 3d effect has an unprecedented impact on the audience, or "want to kneel. ".

When Jixiang was still in college, he was a film buff. Almost every week he goes to the cinema to see a movie. A movie ticket is a lot of money for a student. "At that time, there were not many restaurants in multiplex, so we had to rush to buy tickets and grab good seats. There were also many scalpers and scalpers. It was very cool to get good tickets, good seats and cheap tickets through the cinema connection. "

In the summer of 2014, when Transformers: Age of Extinction was released, online ticket sales platforms for the first time heavily subsidized movie ticket prices. In its first week, the cat's eye film grossed 4.5 million dollars -- more than 30 percent of the box office. For $9.90, viewers can sit in a theater and watch a 3 D blockbuster, which is more than can be said for the free screening of lost mom today.

The seemingly win-win "ticket supplement" , has created the domestic box office market carnival. In 2015, China's box office rose 45 percent from the previous year, taking in 44 billion yuan for the whole year and 4 billion yuan for e-commerce. In 2016, the annual box office reached 45.712 billion yuan, while the size of e-commerce ticket sales shrank to 1.5 billion yuan. Another year later, the main source of ticket spending shifted from online platforms to film studios: In 2017, the annual ticket spending exceeded 2 billion yuan, of which 1.2 billion yuan was spent by film studios.

The audience in 9.9 yuan, 19.9 yuan low price concessions, to develop the habit of going to the cinema to see a movie, but out of their own pocket to compensate the film side is miserable. No tickets means no scheduling, no box office. Wang Zhonglei, CEO of Huayi brothers, said at the 2018 Film Investment Summit Forum that the ticket payment was an unnecessary huge expense, but "if you do not pay, I will tell you friends there to fill the amount of money, you do not fill the words, the cinema does not give you pomp and circumstance" .

At about the same time, Internet film companies have triggered a surge in the price of film rights. In 2010, the exclusive online rights to let the bullets fly sold for $5 million, and four years later, the exclusive online rights to Jiang Wen's gone with the bullets shot up to $30 million.

Crazy arms race subsidies ended in 2018. That year's Spring Festival file, "limit ticket fill" regulation issued, no one can buy less than 19.9 yuan of film tickets.

For producers, the benefits are almost immediate. Chinese films made 60 billion yuan in 2018, setting a new box office record, of which "I am not a drug God" and "nobody" , which cost no more than 60 million yuan, contributed 3.9 billion yuan in total. Small Budget, small production of the film works, finally ushered in their spring.

From 2014 to the present, audiences have gone from the surprise of a 9.9 yuan movie ticket, to readjusting to a few tens of yuan ticket, to learning to pay online to watch the real version, and experienced a similar journey of "reversal and reversal and reversal" .

When audiences finally get used to paying for the legitimate content, the online short video platform for mom makes people wonder whether the simultaneous streaming of movies online and offline will become a new trend? Can An epidemic change an industry?

Almost all of the industry respondents said they were not optimistic.

"First, did you get that much traffic? Second, did you keep the traffic after that? It's not as easy as you think to change the market. "

From a technical point of view, the quality of a home theater can not catch up with that of a theater: "even if your TV is 120 inches, you don't have 7.1 channels; even if your TV is 240 inches, you don't have IMAX. "
