Introduction to behindmylife

2020.2.13

I have seen all the backstage messages, thank you for your encouragement and care, I do not reply one by one, at present, my family and I have no symptoms, relatively safe, also hope you do a good job of protection, safe.

After the friend reminds, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, this year has no romantic atmosphere, can't see the overwhelming publicity, the friend circle also doesn't have a few show love dynamic, buy on behalf of all dumb, collective turn to sell face masks.

In the past, the price of roses has gone up dramatically. The Red Roses of 8 yuan / branch sold for 15 yuan during the festival period. There are still plenty of gifts for 99 and 199 roses. The more you can not hold a big bunch, the more you feel decent. This year, not to mention the red roses, there are few rose bushes to be found, roadside pour is a lot of camellias, dark red yellow stamens, a big round, peach flowers in the park also quietly opened a few, vaguely see a little spring. I just complain these two days to 20 degrees, hot death, but also do not dare to reduce clothes, friends immediately screenshot told me the day after tomorrow cold, snow, ready to sub-zero.

Speaking of Valentine's Day, suddenly special chocolate craving, Xi'an refrigerator frozen three pieces of dark chocolate, alas, when I can go back, to eat the whole piece in one breath. 88% to 90% is my favorite dark chocolate ratio, which is bitter and counteracts cocoa's heaviness, but also surprisingly refreshing, with a creamy texture in the mouth as it dissolves. These days, when I feel really bad, I just go to the dessert blogger's micro blog and look at the cake they made, the beautiful and neat cut surface, the smooth and shiny wet surface, and sigh that this is a work of art, while pretending to have a few bites myself, sugar for the bitter days. A Blogger who works as an apprentice in a Tokyo dessert shop recently started punching in a "one chocolate a day" card, sharing her chocolate every day, detailed text commentary, and four detailed photos. Just reading the text makes me hungry. Don't click on the live map, the other day she shared a triangle of sea salt flavored chocolate with a crunchy nutty center and Black Salt on Top, just the right amount of sweetness that I really wanted to eat.

On our walk, we passed a flower bed at the park entrance. A delivery boy was unpacking a take-out bag. I thought something had happened on the way. I spilled some soup, took the wrong product, the food got cold, and so on, after sitting on the flower bed and eating noodles, I stood nearby and announced to him that it wasn't easy for them to keep running after the city was closed. Brother said to eat a few days of instant noodles ham, a little fresh food, take a few orders in the morning, go to the noodle shop to take the time to let the boss also under a bowl of packing, and finally eat fresh hot breakfast. He ate so fast, I doubt he chewed much, drank all the soup in one Gulp, put on his bowl and chopsticks, put on his helmet and mask and sped off again.

Now many delivery boys are part-time to the supermarket to grab food, waiting at the door to rush in to buy meat, after the community closed to run errands to buy money, although many fresh food stores provide vegetable sets, few businesses to distribute fresh meat eggs and milk. Once I saw a young man's cart filled with pork. I roughly estimated that there were more than 20 boxes. I couldn't help but ask him how he bought so much meat. The young man said he bought all of it on his behalf. He received eight orders this morning and all asked to buy pork. If there was no pork, he would buy chicken instead of cattle and sheep, he had no choice but to stop at the door if he bought the wrong item (the latest news is that supermarkets are limiting their meat purchases to three boxes a person at a time) .

My hair is growing like crazy, when I cut it short, I cut it to pieces, now I'm embarrassed, I have to put a bunch of clips in my pigtails, I had a new year's appointment with Tony, first I have to trim it, then I have to perm the grain and the curve, and then I have to add some color, teacher Tony has been stuck in the village since he returned to his hometown of Xiaogan. Last night, he asked him how he was doing and if he had any infection. He said he was in good health, but his hands were itchy and he couldn't get to the further town even if he walked over several hills in the village, i told him not to do his hair until the epidemic was over, so Tony started doing his cloud-style online, telling me about the trend for 2020 for a couple of minutes, and the hot hair color, what kind of hairstyle would suit my facial features (because I said I wanted to dye my hair red, he immediately taught me not to be too tacky and to be the trendiest boy) .

Wuchang District apologized to the patient for the poor delivery, I watched the video, the patient was on the number 34 bus, the terminal happened to be near my house, and then I realized that one day I walked past the bus stop, and there were seven or eight number 34 buses on the service road, all in one place, the windshield is pasted "Wuhan refuels" several words, thought is sends the Medical Service personnel the special vehicle. There was a man in a white Hazmat suit sitting on the sidewalk talking on the phone. He was very loud and emotional, which scared the sanitation workers nearby. I didn't know what happened, but when I saw the White Hazmat suit, the unconscious becomes very nervous and trots off.

These days the public opinion propaganda looks disgusting, extremely uncomfortable, a few days ago the propaganda old man puts out the life savings several tens of thousands of dollars donation, regardless of whether it is a photo show, this kind of money can not be too hot to receive; also saw praise nurse pregnant for nine months, with a big belly, when the due date is near, you are still saving lives, or you haven't had a miscarriage for 10 days. You have just finished your curettage and are on your way to the front line. The female nurse is afraid of wasting her protective clothing and swallowing her vomit, what is there to praise for a pregnant woman / woman who has just had a miscarriage and is still holding on to her post? Doesn't it highlight in profile the strain of resources and the difficulties of the situation, and don't praise the "retrograde person" , who will rise to the challenge, look death in the face, and is not afraid to sacrifice, and May die in exceptional circumstances, however, the problem that has been exposed is that the front-line personnel do not even have protection. Even if they are encouraged to go to war, they should be equipped with soldiers and horses so that people can run naked on the battlefield. The Great Wall is built of flesh and blood.

Some people assume that if it did not happen in Wuhan, not during the Spring Festival, the situation will not be better, I think not. Today, someone immediately sent a photo to prove that Wuhan's medical resources are among the best in the country, and now they are paralyzed. They can not move themselves at all. They have to rely on the continuous support of medical teams to fill people in, so outbreaks of pneumonia in other cities are not much better.

I was also angry at the news of the violent implementation of the epidemic prevention command, driving out elderly women who buy food late at night, slapping their faces bloody without wearing masks, demanding to kneel down and apologize, and copying "wear a mask" hundreds of times, pulling people out of cars for education... someone posted a video saying it was dangerous to gather a crowd to buy food. Hubei was already a disaster area, and ran out into the street without following orders, including several news items in the back. There were also messages, they wouldn't have to if they did what they were told. Why correct another mistake with a mistake that could have been taught / prevented / propagated in a more civilized, humane, and accessible way, is no excuse for barbarism.

The premise of this approach is that "barbarism is necessary to achieve the goal, the common people are [ silenced ] , need to be governed" , and how similar to our logic of education stick, children do not fight, do not obey, beat it to completion, so in this place, some things come from the same place. Extraordinary Times are even more obvious. For some workers, power has turned from a scarce commodity into a tangible notice. They can finally grasp this elusive thing, and they understand that opportunities are rare, and the epidemic has been removed in the past, in the illusion of "I too am silenced" and the desire to "seize the moment" , their harm to the weak becomes compensation for their own past harm.

Recently, I was reading Shen Dacheng's book. After reading the Short Story Collection "the man who often remembers" , I was reading "The asteroid fell in the afternoon. " Recently, the China Book Network is doing a campaign. It's 88 yuan for 10 optional copies. It's very cost-effective. However, affected by the epidemic, at present, it can not be delivered, the warehouse in the picture also has rent pressure, those who are not anxious to see can go to support them, there are also activities of reading on Douban, many books are on sale, there are few large blocks of time to read, cherish the day at home, may not be false after returning to work, the group is fully committed to fulfill the contract, the end of last year compiled 2020 plan which thought of the epidemic, the first quarter is definitely not expected, the fourth quarter into the inventory, only half a year to play.

Thinking of the postdoctoral fellow studying in the shelter, there was a comment on the front page that many reporters wanted to interview him and contacted the hospital staff. The staff was quite helpless, saying that recently many people asked him for his phone number and wanted to introduce him to someone, in the shelter many aunt elder sister already started to inquire about the news, arranges the blind date, reads more another advantage... also supports the shelter the Xinjiang medical worker, takes the aunts to dance, quite good, the quarantine area patient pressure is so big, reading, dancing, chatting, and relaxing are also good for physical recovery. Xinjiang people are really good at singing and dancing. All the Xinjiang colleagues I know can basically sing and dance, and people are also warm and generous. They were invited to have a barbecue with the whole sheep last year. I thought the little white apricot was the best. It was sweet and sour, it's a hundred times better than apples, melons, and grapes, and in a month or two, it'll be ready for spring and summer. My colleague asked me at the end of the year if I wanted horse sausage, I refused, said no one in my family dare to eat horse meat, listen to a bit creepy, and said that you want the whole sheep, is more expensive, shipping trouble, I: No, my parents are OK, not really eat mutton..

In the latest news, a change of staff has been made, and the resumption of work has also been delayed, and the Work Day has been changed to the 20th. Every day that passes, the ordinary family suffers an additional day of hardship, and thinking that it is already miserable, after the end, the impact of the other links in the chain slowly shows up, do not drop the chain of higher costs, ordinary people will only more difficult, but how is good, sometimes feel better to stop in this winter, anyway, spring also no flowers to enjoy, the Garden Wolf Borrow.
