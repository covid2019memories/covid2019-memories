I seem to have become an invisible source of infection in the village

The family's guard against me began on the day of the siege of Wuhan.

I consider myself a very loved girl, the past winter vacation, the fire table every day sitting next to neighbors and relatives. But this Spring Festival, before love to Chat Yao Dad seems to take a detour and walk, a wall across the uncle's home no longer stepped on my threshold. Although no one said anything, but can imagine the fear of me, because Wuhan "closed" two days ago, I just transferred back from there.

New Year's Eve night, do not want to start a new year in such a bleak, I sent wechat cousin to play cards. He and his sister used to show up in 10 minutes at the drop of a hat, but this year he didn't show up. We can only watch the Spring Festival gala with a family of three.

One of the few villagers on the road.

My Mom and dad weren't paying attention, my dad was watching the short video on his phone very loudly, my mom was talking to someone, and no one cared about me. I was so tense, I felt like my body was burning up, I took my temperature immediately, 37.2 degrees, it was a false alarm. My mother finally found me over-anxious, proposed three people fight landlord, although nothing fun, but such a New Year's Eve, what can be done?

At 2400 hours, the Lunar New Year arrived as scheduled, and the silent night was broken by the sound of firecrackers in the village. A few years ago, we had a total ban on shooting guns in our village, but this year it seems to have been forgotten. In Ensch, fireworks and firecrackers used to be set off on Lunar New Year's Eve. Later, they were not allowed to be set off. As soon as New Year's day rolls around, propaganda vehicles will drive into the village to promote the ban on whips. This year the van is here as usual, but the loudspeakers shout, "the epidemic is spreading. For Your Health and mine, we propose the following... "

Our village, on the outskirts of Ensch, is better informed than the villages deep in the mountains. But when I first returned home on January 21, there was little awareness of the epidemic among those around me until Wuhan was "sealed off" .

On the night of January 23, my aunt, who works in the village hospital, attended three meetings, from the state level to the city level and then to the town level. The next morning, she went to a village meeting, saying that state leaders had given orders: those who did not do a good job, write their resignation reports directly; those who caused major mistakes, send them directly to the judiciary. Even though my aunt was a doctor, she had not expected it to be so serious before these meetings.

It is also the aunt these several meetings, just let the family elders began to attach importance to protection. It was as hard to persuade an elder to wear a mask as it was for them to tell us to wear long johns. But after that day, even my aunt, who didn't go out much, wore a mask at home.

In the past, the road one after another, each family is playing Mahjong, playing cards, melon seeds... this year not to mention the car, even few people, occasionally see a few of the same village, all neatly wearing a mask. At the end of December, adults are busy preparing new year goods, snacks, fruit, dried fruit, but also made a big pot of fried fish, beef Jerky, pickled peppers chicken feet... now all began to worry about eating. The house was deserted. No visitors came, and they did not go anywhere.

I also received a message from the village committee to find out if I had stayed in Wuhan recently or had a transfer. Anyone with the above experience should be closely followed for 14 days. I can't walk around. The biggest area is my village. Really sit not to live on the road to the door stroll, walk to a few uncle door also dare not enter.

Early on the morning of the 27th, my aunt called me again. It was said that there had been suspected cases in the village. A relative returned from Wuhan with fever and cough. The hospital tested positive for COVID-19 pneumonia, but due to the lack of test kits, it's still being diagnosed. Now, the village is trying to figure out who the family contacted.

Even such a small village hundreds of miles away from Wuhan, no one is necessarily safe.

In the evening, the village director gave me two phone calls, cell phone charging did not receive, he is probably afraid of my mobile, and Wechat informed me to stay at home, do not visit relatives. I mean, can't you even walk down the street with a mask on? I seem to have become an invisible source of infection in the village, worthy of the name "God of plague. ".

The village road closure, want to get out of the village at the end of the road block stones.

Not a group of years, as if the family on the light

When the first case of COVID-19 pneumonia was discovered in the south China Seafood City of Wuhan on December 8 last year, I was trying to figure out when my little nephew would be born and what gadgets to buy him.

My sister married in Wuhan. She had no relatives there. The 17th month of the 12th Lunar Month, the little nephew was born, our big family planned to drive to Wuhan on the 7th day of the first lunar month, put full moon wine to her long face, let brother-in-law know our people ding prosperous, not easy to bully. But I couldn't make it. I had to go back to Beijing for my internship, so I thought I'd pay a visit years ago.

Spring Festival ticket is very difficult to buy, robbed for a long time to buy tickets from Beijing to Wuhan. At the time, the authorities reported more than 60 cases in Wuhan. I thought that in such a big city, more than 60 cases should not be a big problem, and had previously issued a statement that it was "preventable and controllable. ". From the train station to the Guanggu Square subway, I also specifically observed that not many people wear masks.

In winter, Wuhan is cloudy and rainy, unlike Beijing, where it is always sunny. Wuhan is like my second home, bearing too many memories of youth, taste buds are also extremely miss the taste of foreign countries do not have. As soon as my bags were packed, my friends and I went to the Guizhou Sour Soup Restaurant near the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law. After college students returned home, the crowded food street lost its vitality, with only a few pedestrians. Two or three tables in the shop, the boss said at the checkout: You two can eat too much.

So far, I am still in the joy.

On the morning of January 20th, I began to realize that it wasn't that simple. Opened the micro blog found that COVID-19 pneumonia cases increased from more than 60 cases to more than 190 cases, shocked, who knows the next day will increase how much? My sister and I quickly discussed, years later to see the little nephew, change the next day back to Ensch ticket. It turned out that if he had not changed his visa, he would probably still be in Wuhan.

On the D5867 train home, I kept checking my phone, and every news item about the outbreak was refreshing my knowledge. There's not a lot of talking on the road, just checking my phone. In retrospect, if I had not said "controllable" at the beginning, "have not found human-to-human transmission" , I would not have gone to Wuhan at that time, especially I am so afraid of death.

As soon as I got home, I washed my hair, took a shower, washed my clothes with disinfectant, and told my mother to cancel the full moon dinner. But she doesn't think so. She says that life and death have a destiny, that the virus doesn't come to us, and she believes in fate, but the virus doesn't. I tried to talk my sister out of it, but she's only 30 and she's so uptight, and it's not a good idea to cancel.

The twist came on January 22nd. Our family has a "year of the Tuan" practices, a large family of 30 or 40 people, from the 12th month twenty-four began in each family dinner, today at Uncle's home, tomorrow at aunt's home, every day together to eat. Over the past few days, the news was much more broadcast, the elders also began to panic, there was always discussion at the dinner table, my aunt suggested that my sister cancel the "Full Moon Feast, " my mother was also very nervous, plus I had been indoctrinated all day, after dinner, I would go home and call my sister, she finally decided to cancel.

Although do not go to Wuhan, but during the Spring Festival in the village to visit relatives frequently, to eat inevitable push cup change cup. No one knows for sure if any of the people they've been in contact with in the last 14 days have COVID-19.

Wuhan "closed city" that day in the year of Tuopa family, in Wuhan Work Cousin came back, the dinner table has someone not as natural as the day before, asked cousin do not visit relatives. The cousin's mother was obviously unhappy and went away after eating. On New Year's Day, she naturally wants her son to visit relatives.

But I think the momentum is good, and began to persuade my mother to cancel this year's "league year. ". She said no, a lot of families have already gathered in front of us, can not be canceled at home. She was afraid of losing her tongue and ate the family reunion dinner in front of her. Tuan Nian, adults feel that is a rare family reunion, but also a hard year finally relax, everyone hopes in their family "Tuan Nian" that day, we have fun, eat a good time. If you do not get together on such a day, it seems that the family will become weak.

Fortunately, there is another cousin-in-law assists, she works in the hotel, a cold has been coughing, also want to cancel. On the twenty-nine night of the 12th month, the two of US sang together in the family group. She told me how serious the epidemic was. I sent out documents banning gatherings elsewhere, don't take any chances..

New Year's Eve early in the morning, the original first in his family "mission year" four uncle sent a message: cancel the mission dinner. There were 830 confirmed cases and 25 deaths in China. It's responsible for the family and responsible for society, said four uncles on the family wechat group. Subsequently, originally scheduled for the second and third day of the aunt's home and my family have decided to cancel the reunion dinner.

My cousin, who works in Wuhan, visits his late father's grave at the age of 30. Wearing a mask, he comes to our door and calls my parents at a distance. When I invited him in for tea, he said, "in special times, it's better to pay attention! " My sister's family plans are all in disarray, not to mention the seating arrangements. My brother-in-law is becoming a "rat crossing the street. " Some people in his work group even asked people in Wuhan to withdraw from the group, viruses seem to be able to spread through the Internet.

A big family discussing the epidemic at my uncle's house.

A long incubation period of 14 days

Early in the morning, I was awakened by the noise outside the bedroom. My mother said my father's voice was loud enough to disturb me. "She's already nervous. Let her have a rest. You can hear him every other room. " In fact, she spoke much louder than my father.

My mother was hospitalized years ago with a lung infection that left her with a cough. My Dad used to smoke cigarettes a few years back, and he coughed once in a while. In bed to hear them cough, I was shocked, began to worry, the virus in the incubation period is also infectious, even if I did not infected, will carry the virus infected them?

My physical quality is not very good, before the holiday when some cold, from Wuhan back has been dizzy, can not help but doubt. The first night, my father and a sudden cough, I stimulate the spirit, quickly touched his hand, still do not burn. The next morning, I was still dizzy and felt that I couldn't put it off any longer. I had to go to the hospital for an examination. My mom wouldn't let me, but she couldn't resist.

I put on two masks, went to the nearest hospital, came in, a nurse told me to take my temperature, 36.7 degrees. The hospital is not in the city center, relatively few people come to see patients are to check for COVID-19 pneumonia. Most of the confirmed cases are being quarantined at other hospitals, where there are only suspected cases and very few, the nurse said.

Hospital lab report.

I checked the blood, I took a CT scan of the lungs, and they both showed no infection, and I was relieved, but then I started freaking out again, and I told the doctor to give me something for my headache, and he said No. After going back although do not cough, do not have a fever, but still dizzy brain bilges, ate two my mother year-round to eat the headache medicine, hope can not faint.

These days pass very slowly, wake up to ask my mother, only the third day of the first month, I feel should be the first month of the 15th. It's a long way from the 14-day incubation period. It's tough.

On the eve of the Lunar New Year, we in Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture ordered a "city closure" , closing down all entertainment venues, even old ladies were no longer allowed to dance in the square. Within three days, some of the neighbors could not sit still, standing on the road, far away from a distance, chatting for a while.

Living across the street, aunt Xie originally prepared to dig Houttuynia, the fourth day, the previous year, the fifth day, the sixth day can sell a good price, and this year, the market empty. The uncle that loves to play cards can not gather together card table, the 2nd day begins to Sprinkle Weedkiller in the field. Living on the river side of the Peng family, do not know where dug a few trees, grandparents and grandchildren began to break ground in the fields..

Another family went to Fujian New Year, they sent a friend circle: Fujian weather is so good, we can not even go out... outside where can not go, also can not come back.

In order to avoid population movement, our village committee also issued a road closure notice. Unlike the "hard core road closure" posted on the Internet, the main road in our village is just piled with stones. Some people want to take this road into Enshi City, remove the stones with their bare hands, and drive their cars into the city as if nothing had happened.

At the moment, there is not much about the fate of the country's feelings, really dizzy. There's a lot of information online, but it's hard to tell the truth from the rumor. I consciously block them so that false information doesn't magnify my anxiety. If there's one thing I've learned, it's to expect transparency in the future. I hope that 14 days will pass quickly and more people will get through 2020, which is not a good start.
