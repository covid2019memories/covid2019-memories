##FIGHT THE NEW CROWN: CT results will be included in the diagnostic criteria

Lifeweek

Features an introduction to a magazine and the life he advocates.

As the shortage of kits eased, the nucleic acid test, the main criterion for the diagnosis of NCP, reignited the debate. Some doctors working on the front line of the epidemic found that some patients tested negative for nucleic acid, but the disease continued to develop, and family members also infected. In addition to nucleic acid testing, many experts have proposed that the results of CT imaging should also be included in the screening criteria for new pneumonia. Is this feasible?

The experts'calls have been met with a response at the policy level. On the afternoon of February 5, the National Health and COVID-19 issued the fifth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan for pneumonia with COVID-19 infection, which stipulates CT findings as the diagnostic criteria for clinical cases (only in Hubei Province) .

NEGATIVE FOR NUCLEIC ACID?

Nearly a week after the first nucleic acid test, on February 3, Wang Hui took his mother, Wu Fang, to the hospital for a nucleic acid test. Wu Fang, 70, developed a fever on January 23. Her condition deteriorated three days later, presenting with symptoms of dyspnea, general weakness and vomiting. Wang Hui quickly drove his mother to the Eighth Hospital in Wuhan, the lung CT has just finished, the mother has not yet come down from the CT machine, the doctor said to him, "you have to stay away from the patient. "

CT results showed that Wu Fang's lungs had ground-glass opacity and both had been infected. After the laboratory report came out, doctors ruled out viral influenza, bacterial infection, cold and other diseases with similar symptoms, "there is only one possibility [ of new coronary pneumonia ] . "

To confirm the diagnosis, Wang took his mother to the Wuhan Union Hospital for a nucleic acid test on Jan. 28. After seeing Wu's CT and test report, the doctor issued a list of nucleic acid tests. Wang said doctors told him the nucleic acid test was limited to CT SCANS and blood test results for highly suspicious people. Wang Hui's mother is getting worse and worse, Wang Hui can only hope that through the nucleic acid test diagnosis, the mother was sent to hospital treatment.

COVID-19 NUCLEIC ACID test kit

After taking throat swabs from Wu Fang, the inspectors told Wang that the test results were not public and that positive results would be notified by phone within 24 to 48 hours. But a week after the first sample was taken, they still hadn't received any kind of notification, so the test may have been negative. In the days that followed, Wu Fang's condition did not improve. Wang Hui had to take his mother to do a nucleic acid test. As of press time, nearly 48 hours from the second sampling time, Wang Hui still has not received the test results.

"I don't know whether it's negative or positive, or whether my mother's test results are false negative, " Wang said. If it's negative, shouldn't it be in writing? Take it so my mother can go out on the street without you isolating her."

A number of clinicians have experienced similar confusion. Dr Lo fung-ming, associate director of respiratory and critical care medicine, Hwaseo Hospital, Sichuan University, is the leader of the team assisting the Red Cross Hospital in Wuhan. "there are more than 20 patients in our ward, " he told the Financial Times. "according to my clinical experience, most of them are COVID-19 pneumonia, but there are some patients I judge to be (new crown pneumonia) , but the test results are negative. "

Luo Fengming believes that there are two possibilities. One is that there may be problems in the sampling process and the testing method. The other is that these suspected patients become negative after treatment, which is a result of treatment. "So even if we do a nucleic acid test and get the result, we are not sure in our hearts, " Luo said, adding that his current practice is based on clinical experience, combined with the patient's symptoms, history, as well as the results of imaging, testing to judge the synthesis.

CAN CT findings be included in the diagnostic criteria?

On Feb. 3, a screenshot from the friend circle of Zhang Xiaochun, deputy director of the imaging department at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, sparked a debate about nucleic acid testing. Zhang Xiaochun in the friends circle appeal, "do not believe in nucleic acid testing" , she strongly recommended CT imaging as the current new pneumonia screening of the main basis; People who had no symptoms or negative nucleic acid tests but whose CT images showed problems in their lungs were also given isolation.

Zhang Xiaochun's judgment was based on her observation that the Wuhan family cluster was becoming more and more frequent, and most of the episodes were insidious, one or even many times negative, without any clinical symptoms. Zhang later explained in an interview that many of the patients had problems with the CT scan, but the nucleic acid test was negative and sent them home. A few days later, the patient's condition worsened and the whole family was infected.

"It's not like people think you can just take a urine sample and make your own. NUCLEIC ACID testing from sampling, isolation, and assays are all required in a specific environment, especially for infectious samples. It doesn't mean you can take the virus and test it, but you have to isolate the nucleic acid of the virus, from sampling to separation and extraction, if you don't strictly follow the requirements, these processes are easily contaminated and may lead to inaccurate test results,"an expert, who declined to be named, told scidev.net, nUCLEIC ACID testing itself has some technical limitations, such as the relatively high probability of false positive, "because COVID-19 is an RNA virus, and it degrades over time, it can affect the accuracy of the test, " she said, nUCLEIC ACID testing requires a high level of lab environment and lab operators, so it can not be expanded or lowered the testing threshold at will.

Zhang Xiaochun said that her post on the friends'circle was not meant to negate the results of nucleic acid testing, but that under the current environment in Wuhan, the use of nucleic acid testing as a means of final testing is limited by production, sampling methods and so on, "Wuhan, as an epidemic area, can not completely rely on nucleic acid testing to screen patients, to cut off the source of infection prevention and control. "

Doctors in the imaging department of a Level III hospital told the economist that nearly 300 people have CT scans every day at their hospital, and most show lung problems, "Some of these people can be diagnosed with NCP, but there are only 100 markers for nucleic acid testing in hospitals, so we can't rule out patients who don't have it. "

Yu Jiao Zhang, clinical director of Thoracic Radiation Oncology at the Andson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, Houston, recently received help from a number of radiologists in China regarding the diagnostic criteria for new pneumonia, instead of rushing to respond, he studied all the public data about the outbreak. Zhang Yujiao said to this magazine that from the current information, the number of test kits may still be insufficient, sensitivity is also a problem, false negative problem to the diagnosis of clinicians increased difficulty. "The number of new cases is increasing both in Wuhan and across the country, and from this point of view, I think a better measure is needed to stop the spread of the epidemic. "

"Many hospitals have CT scans, and they can give the results as soon as they are done, and then, according to the clinical conditions, they should be more practical, " Zhang said. "Now we should consider that in the absence of a confirmed nucleic acid test, " Zhang said, combining the results of CT imaging with the typical symptoms of patients, such as fever, dyspnea, contact and travel history, can help doctors make the diagnosis more quickly. "Only in this way can we eliminate the patients who slip through the net and prevent and control the epidemic more effectively. "

However, Zhang Yujiao also mentioned that, "there is also the possibility of misdiagnosis based on imaging without verification by nucleic acid testing. Because of other viral pneumonia, symptoms and imaging findings may overlap with NCP. But it doesn't matter, even if there is overlap, there is nothing wrong with isolating these patients with infectious diseases and giving them supportive care."

On the afternoon of February 5, Zhang Xiaochun sent a text message to our reporter. The National Health Commission had just released the diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-19 pneumonia (trial version 5) that day, "suspected cases with imaging features of pneumonia as the current severe epidemic areas in Hubei Province, the clinical diagnosis of cases standard. ". The protocol adds a new "clinically diagnosed case" to the "suspected case" and "confirmed case" , and uses "suspected case with imaging features of pneumonia" as its diagnostic criteria (only in Hubei Province) , this also means that the results of CT imaging has become a "clinical diagnosis of the case" to determine the basis.
