2020.2.5

Dazzling the past half a month, still feel in the dream, unreal. Today, the highest temperature is 15 Â°C, heating is still provided in Xi'an, and even warm people in Wuhan can take off their sweaters and walk in sweat in the Sun. (in fact, they dare not take off their clothes at will. Even a common cold can scare a house full of people during an epidemic.). The more I thought about it, the more disappointed I became. It was a waste of more than a month. I even felt sad because I had to pay nearly 2000 yuan for the heating fee at the end of last year.

Xi'an just under the document, from the field back to the people must be isolated at home for 14 days, the landlord is not allowed to rent a room at will, timely report tenant information, a fever directly sealed building. When my colleague handed me the document, he added, "I think it might be summer if I see you again. " I said it was very possible. I now have a Wuhan / Hubei Identity Card and go back to my rented residential area like a hot potato, the property may be closed to me directly at home, not allowed to go out, the door stickers, food is not to eat.

The property in our community is too unreliable. I asked if they could organize residents to order food collectively and distribute it uniformly. The community staff replied to me, "we are not responsible for this. We have not received the notice from above. " I said that the surrounding communities have all started to pull together orders, it is also convenient for the residents to send them to the gate of the residential area. They do not have to run out often. It is not safe to buy food now. The staff members continue to shake their heads. "solve it by themselves. There are all bicycles at the gate. After eating, you can ride a bicycle and go to the supermarket ahead to buy it. " I asked two staff members in a row, are similar answer, perfunctory, reminder of the property fee when it is very positive.

The day before yesterday there have been rumors, 10 closed doors, supermarkets and pharmacies all closed, unified distribution of materials, last night the official text refuted rumors, Shangchao normal business, there is no take-over said. The situation is grim, we are a bit anxious, listen to the wind is the rain, head always stretched a line, the air can be heard gradually taut pull sound. Although several officials have spoken out actively, at this point, public confidence has basically become negative. I automatically put a few question marks on everything I say. The group all said not to spread false news, to avoid panic, and to be calm, I still went out and bought several large bags of vegetables.

These two days more people in the supermarket, there may be a group of people and I think similar, "not afraid of ten thousand just in case. ". I now see the crowd gather slightly, all braved goose pimples, subconsciously back a few steps, yesterday in Hualian, encountered fresh pork arrived (shelves are the stock of frozen pork) , supermarket staff immediately chopped whole pigs, nearby 10 meters customers all gather around the chopping board, "I want a piece of spare ribs" , "cut the inside Ridge" , "do you have any pork belly, I want two" , "Hey, leave one for me" , "back of the line, I quite early here to guard" , standing at the front, the old man grabbed the whole rib and left the line with a smile on his face. I craned my neck to see the price tag on the bag, 143.28 yuan, after "the Cherry is free" , ribs can also be written into the profile of a successful man -- A straight-laced, pork-fed, lean, fat-free man.

At 8:00 this morning, I set out to box the horses. I was lucky to be among the first group of customers to enter the shop. Many people were afraid to go out. The delivery platform raised the price and asked someone to buy it for them. I heard from the nearby riders that a single delivery fee could be in the triple digits, $50, $60, no one would take the job. In less than half an hour, the shelves of fresh vegetables were completely sold out, leaving only Chinese cabbage, white turnips and green peppers. The meat shelves had been empty all along, and no new ones had been put on at all. The staff dragged over a dozen cases of eggs and sold them out within half an hour, many people went in pursuit of buying meat, and found only eggs. They were unwilling to take four or five boxes, and there were also those who moved half a box directly. I think it's probably fake news to close the store, but it's a pity that everyone has been an honest person several times, found that honest people are more easily fooled, this time do not buy, still run to the store super goods.

All around were the whole family, driving around at the risk of being ticketed by traffic police, pushing two cars with their left and right hands. I sometimes wondered why people in Wuhan had such a big refrigerator in their home, and how they bought a truckload of frozen dumplings, beef and mutton rolls for shabu hot pot, meatball shrimp slide is also four or five boxes to the basket stuffed, this to put our home, there is no room to save.

The Wuhan People's Defense has many tricks: wearing sunglasses and swimming goggles, wearing three layers of shoe covers on the feet, women can wear woolen hats directly, men simply wear transparent garbage bags and shower caps on their heads, those without gloves wrap their hands in Saran wrap, and wear disposable raincoats, and a guy who shops in a white hazmat suit.

Because the meat rack was completely empty, I didn't have to buy some meat reserve for my family. In total, it took me only a few minutes to buy the necessary vegetables. I saw that the checkout line was more than 10 meters long, and the people were all crowded. My Scalp was so thick that I turned my head to the empty dining area, strolling back and forth, waiting for this wave of people to pass before making payment. As a result, it took more than two hours for the store to see a significant decrease in the flow of people. There were too many people. The staff could not even take care of the stock on the shelves. They simply could not serve the new dishes. The people coming in the back of the store saw that there was nothing to buy, have been disappointed to leave.

On Weibo, I met some friends who were trapped in Wuchang. One of them was a girl who lived very close to me. She went to Hualian with her family in the morning, the girl fought tooth and nail for the last packet of instant noodles. She asked me last night if there was any place where we could still buy alcohol, and I said that the drug stores were out of stock long ago, and I don't think we could buy any in the short term, but the vodka was so strong that we couldn't even buy a few bottles of spirits to sterilize them, and as a result, half of the wall was sold off in Hualian and Baijiu today..

Two things I regret most after the closure of the city: Not Taking advantage of the notice issued by the break to escape with the whole family (now can only admit defeat) , can not ride a bicycle, it's a two-legged ride (too bad to turn and brake, only accessible on the parkway) .

There are several new shelter hospitals in Wuhan, Wuchang's is located in the Wembley Arena, my classmate died of anger after learning the news, she lives in a community especially close to the Wembley Arena (500 meters in a straight line) , their building has been confirmed cases, once the hospital was opened, she was afraid to leave her home to patients in the Wuchang area. Her classmates had blocked the drain with Lids, and she had to sterilize it 84 times a day, "feel the air is floating in the community virus, afternoon to the door to take vegetables are heavily armed, took and ran, do not want to stay a second, if the Wembley Arena has become a quarantine point, the doors and windows do not dare to open, too scary. ".

In the morning, watching the live broadcast of the CCTV reporter's visit, the conditions of the Shelter Hospital were indeed quite simple. The beds were only made of vertical isolation plastic sheets. The distance between the beds was tight, and the protection was not in place. It was not suitable for the living of infectious patients. The ventilation conditions in stadiums, convention and exhibition centers and other places are also poor, and the air is not circulating. Patients who dare to live directly in them can not cross-infect different patients, and even mild cases can be dragged to severe ones. Instead of centralized isolation, it is convenient for medical workers to manage them in a unified way, it's better to admit we're all dying.

There is nothing wrong with the measure of collective isolation, it is too late, always taking patches to cover patches, without any foresight, patting one's head on the next document, alas, if the measure of unified treatment had been introduced earlier, the situation today would be much alleviated, how many people believe in home isolation, drug observation of the proposal, and the lack of scientific isolation of knowledge and equipment, resulting in the "one person infected, the whole family strokes" family transmission. The "inflection point" , which had been constantly emphasized, now became "uncertain and hard to say" . The mood was like a pendulum, swinging up and down, reaching its highest point and then falling back to its lowest point.

Fang Fang, the author of Fang Fang and Chi Li, a former favorite of Wuhan women writers, has been trending on Weibo in recent days. In the past tense, I haven't read their works for a long time, last time I read in high school, this time I saw Ms. Fang Fang's words, and I ordered several books to support her. "A grain of dust of the times, falling on one's head, is a mountain. " The courage, compassion, morality and integrity of the teachers deserve to be the yardstick of the writers and artists in Hubei Province.
