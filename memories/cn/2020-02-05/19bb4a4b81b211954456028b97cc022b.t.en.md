Every night when I soak feet, my mother and I always have one thing to do: Bring a small stool, mother sat down, I soak feet while giving her a shoulder massage. She lowered her head to reveal her neck. When I pressed it, she said "ah" . I asked if it was too strong. She said it was nothing, "One day in the dark nest in the room to watch TV, always pain here and there, if go to the field to work, not so much. " I laughed: "It seems that you are not free life. "

I saw her busy every day, picking Haiqing from the vegetable garden, washing clothes in the pond, upstairs and downstairs cleaning... I want to help, she busy said: "You do not come, if the trouser leg is muddy, I have to wash! " Or to wash the dishes, "Don't wash it, it's too cold, " she added. I said, "it's cold, too. " She replied, "I'm used to it. " I once joked, "mom, you're doing so much that no one else in the house can get a hand in. " She said, "No, you're all busy with something else. "

Often, my mother did all the housework, my father wouldn't do it because he was sick, and I had less time at home to help my mother. A shoulder rub was the only thing I could do to help my mother.

She took out the ointment made in Japan, is the sister-in-law specially bought for her, can activate blood, let me help rub in pain. Next to the small table, there is a large bottle of american-made cod liver oil, which uncle brought back from Guangzhou for his mother to eat, is said to help prevent cardiovascular disease. To my shame, I have been to many countries and never thought of buying things for my parents, let alone taking care of them.

The family needs money. I'll call right away. But they seldom ask me for money. I also give some money for the new year. At the end of the day, so easy, to find their own peace of mind, not like sister-in-law and uncle so meticulous. The Chinese New Year was supposed to bring my parents for a medical check-up, but due to the epidemic, I had to give up.

So far, I do not know how to return home, more like the home. There were many things I could do with my mother, and she consciously asked me to do with her:

The Sun is good, the mother washed clean radish, carried to the house, I am responsible for the root of the radish shaving, the mother is responsible for the radish diced.

Go to the fields to pick wild vegetables, my mother drove the three-wheeler, I sat next to her, go to the lake, the early morning Sun just shed, the field from afar to a piece of frost white, green wheat field, with the wind ups and downs, the leaves of the dewdrop crystal clear.

In the evening, mother steamed sweet potatoes, put them into the basin mashed potato flour, I will be responsible for kneading and kneading, knead well, we then rub together into a ball. When we do it together, sometimes we talk, sometimes we don't, but we like it.
Usually, if I stay at home too long, I go for a walk on the Yangtze River embankment in the morning. After walking three miles, when returning, I saw a man coming in the distance, very like a mother. When she came near, she really looked like a mother. Asked why she came, she said: "I have been looking for you. " I asked what happened, the mother smiled: "Just want to walk with you. "

We turned to the 100-meter harbor to walk together, Mother said: "always afraid you went in the opposite direction, left to see, right to see, far away to see a person, I knew it was you. " I walked on her arm, "I planted these trees with the people in the polder... When the leaves come out, you should go too, " she said, pointing to the shelterbelt

My mother told me about her early years when she went to farm in Ruichang Mountain on the other side of the Yangtze River. After a busy day in the family field, in the afternoon, she came back with a bag of snakeskin and a hoe. Her father took her to the ferry along the Yangtze River Levee.

I interjected, "I hid in my room while you were gone, and could not bear to see you go. " My mother nodded? Ten years old? Your father said to the sweet-scented Osmanthus in front of him, 'Qinger, you help me look, don't let him play in the water. ' I didn't dare to stop at all, afraid of a stop to go. "

My mother told me about a time when the river was foggy and the ship wouldn't sail. She had to return home and found me asleep in bed. When she picked me up and took me to the bath, I woke up and emitted excited cheers, but mother remembers.

What we do together, watching videos together. After dinner and washing my feet in the evening, my mother often came to my room on the second floor. I was writing, and she sat on the Sofa for a few minutes, couldn't sit still, got up, swept the floor, looked in the water bottle, and hung up her clothes in the closet.

I smiled and asked: "is the TV not good? " I remember every time I went downstairs, she sat alone in the room with a remote control, a TV show often interrupted by a bunch of ads. She nodded and said yes. I sat her down next to me, and I searched the Internet for programs, documentaries, or TV shows that my mother understood.

Watching together, the mother said: "Or this good Ah, no advertising, to see how much more. " After a while, she asked: "You hungry? I cook you dumplings to eat. " I pulled her to sit down, "Not Hungry, not hungry, continue to see. " Mother said good, looked at and asked: "You this pants is a bit dirty, tomorrow morning for me to wash. " I said helplessly: "I know, do not be distracted. "

After the video, it's after 8:00. Mother got up and said: "Go to bed early. Every day in front of the computer, to protect the eyes. " I said know. She was just about to go down, and I stopped her. There is moonlight outside the window, the probe to see, deep blue sky embedded in a half moon, oblique lower corner of a gold star.

I suggested a walk outside, expecting my mother to say no too late, but she readily agreed. We put on masks and went out the door. We went up to the concrete road in the embankment. The light of the street lamp shed and our shadows lengthened. Dogs barked, Gates were locked and lights were burning inside.

Out of the mouth of the dike, the fields on both sides of the sound of rustling, the original wind blowing. My mother asked, "are you cold? " I said No. We walked back slowly. As I walked, I gave her another shoulder rub. "Don't rub it, " My mother said, "I feel better already. " She said, squeezing my hand. "and your hand will get tired. "

Every night when I soak feet, my mother and I always have one thing to do: Bring a small stool, mother sat down, I soak feet while giving her a shoulder massage. She lowered her head to reveal her neck. When I pressed it, she said "ah" . I asked if it was too strong. She said it was nothing, "One day in the dark nest in the room to watch TV, always pain here and there, if go to the field to work, not so much. " I laughed: "It seems that you are not free life. "

I saw her busy every day, picking Haiqing from the vegetable garden, washing clothes in the pond, upstairs and downstairs cleaning... I want to help, she busy said: "You do not come, if the trouser leg is muddy, I have to wash! " Or to wash the dishes, "Don't wash it, it's too cold, " she added. I said, "it's cold, too. " She replied, "I'm used to it. " I once joked, "mom, you're doing so much that no one else in the house can get a hand in. " She said, "No, you're all busy with something else. "

Often, my mother did all the housework, my father wouldn't do it because he was sick, and I had less time at home to help my mother. A shoulder rub was the only thing I could do to help my mother.

She took out the ointment made in Japan, is the sister-in-law specially bought for her, can activate blood, let me help rub in pain. Next to the small table, there is a large bottle of american-made cod liver oil, which uncle brought back from Guangzhou for his mother to eat, is said to help prevent cardiovascular disease. To my shame, I have been to many countries and never thought of buying things for my parents, let alone taking care of them.

The family needs money. I'll call right away. But they seldom ask me for money. I also give some money for the new year. At the end of the day, so easy, to find their own peace of mind, not like sister-in-law and uncle so meticulous. The Chinese New Year was supposed to bring my parents for a medical check-up, but due to the epidemic, I had to give up.
