A large number of startups are facing cash flow pressure, and maintaining cash flow for more than six months is considered the key to a company's survival.

”

In the Spring Festival of 2020, the sudden outbreak caught entrepreneurs off guard.

On January 14,12 Dong, a start-up Company, opened its largest off-line clip machine shop in Wuhan.

The 1,000-square-meter store, Lj Jengzhan, was supposed to be a prototype but closed on the night of January 24 after 10 days.

A dozen stores in Beijing, Shanghai and seven other cities have since closed. Only two are open and the hours have been cut dramatically, with all closing in February.

This first rely on "long grass group son" EMOJI IP access to a large number of dissemination, and then grow into a cartoon image IP incubation operation of the company, the offline business into trouble.

"The LJ clamps account for 60% of the company's revenue when it's good, and the shutdown is putting a lot of pressure on our cash flow. And we're also under pressure to pay rent and labor costs, and if things don't get better, the money in the account will last two months,"12 culture co-founder and Coo told interface news.

Because of the epidemic, there are still many enterprises such as 12 Dong that are suddenly in trouble. The catering, tourism and offline retail industries bear the brunt, and the entity-related industries have also been greatly affected. Under the general environment, more industries will be affected by the gradual emergence.

Reference can be made to 2003, when China's four-quarter GDP growth rate of 11.1% , 9.1% , 10% and 10% respectively, of which the second quarter by the "SARS" impact of the decline in growth is very obvious. In addition to the catering, tourism and offline retail sectors, the SASAC survey showed that in the second quarter of 2003,65.5 percent of enterprises reported that the SARS epidemic had adversely affected their production and business activities, mainly concentrated in enterprise sales, exports, project negotiations and construction, and so on, that the impact of sales of enterprises as high as 61.6% .

On February 2, Zhu Xiaohu, a partner at Jinsha River venture capital, said in a friend's circle that this year is worse than SARS and is a life-and-death issue for many start-ups.

A number of internet industry entrepreneurs have also told interface news, the impact of the epidemic on the company certainly has, how much more need to wait and see. Despite the pressure, they have begun to take action, and intend to overcome all difficulties to reduce losses, until the epidemic over.

###The most anxious Spring Festival

On January 19, Li Xin (not her real name)'s company took an early break from her last job interview. In 2019, the company had more customers than he expected, but it was understaffed and everyone was tired. He wanted everyone to take advantage of the Spring Festival to get some rest and get back to work in the coming year.

Two years ago, Li Xin left the Administrative Department of a head Internet company TO START HIS OWN office location consulting company, relying on the office property and venue resources he had accumulated from his work.

In 2019, the first year of its full corporate operations, he won a customer base of thousands of Internet companies, hosted some of the biggest conferences, and employed five people to churn out five million a year. This year, he plans to hire a few more people to make it 8 million.

In early January, Li Xin paid attention to the news of the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, but in the circumstances, he didn't take it seriously. Soon, with the daily increase in confirmed cases, prevention and control measures around the escalation of the epidemic, friends, wechat groups are all the news of the pneumonia epidemic, Li Xin has gradually become anxious.

He quickly found two clients he had agreed to years ago, in Florida, to reconfirm the deal. One was scheduled to change offices in March and said he wouldn't move. The other was planning to hire a large number of people over the next year and wanted to rent a new 8,000 square foot office, also because the epidemic first not to confess, looking for the office of the plan naturally shelved. "Two people I recruited years ago couldn't come to work because of Fengcun. You have no idea how desperate I am, " Li told interface news.

It was like a pause button for a fast-moving startup, and everything came to a screeching halt.

Chaos also have this feeling: the original 12-building offline derivatives business is high-speed flow, but now because of the epidemic stalled.

Some of the derivative products produced by the 12 houses went to bookstores such as Yanjiyou, 1983 Chaowan store and Wenchuang store, which accounted for 40% of the 12 houses'offline revenue. February was supposed to be the peak season for sales. The stores had already placed orders with 12 houses a year ago, and 12 houses were ready for stock. Now all these goods are stuck in the warehouses of 12 houses, 12 houses have to pay $800,000 a month for storage.

Another part of the product flow to the LJ clamp machine accounted for. After opening a new store in Wuhan two years ago, it was wildly estimated that the monthly flow of water during the Spring Festival could reach 30 million to 35 million yuan, but under the current situation, the flow of water basically returns to zero. Not only that, but his monthly rent and labor costs are about 12 million yuan.

"Our company is also experienced this industry from scratch, has been more confident, but this cultural and creative industry was really hit pretty big. " Random told interface news.

What worries him more is that the recovery of cultural and creative industries will lag behind those of catering and tourism, which are just needed industries. "The food and tourism will be back in a month after the outbreak, but we need two months, " he said.

The last two years have been a cold winter of capital, and start-ups are having a hard time. Thai capital last year surveyed more than 30 head investors on their investment and financing strategies for 2020, including Jti, US dollar and RMB institutions. Only 14 per cent of institutions said they would be more active in their investment strategy over the next year, while 57 per cent said they would contract further, the survey found.

If some entrepreneurs can still find opportunities in the cold winter by being proactive in their industries and innovating their business models, this outbreak has left too little time for entrepreneurs to react.

###To help themselves

During the longest Lunar New Year holiday, entrepreneurs have no interest in rest and recreation. They have to come up with a solution right away, or at least make the company last longer.

Chaos and 12 building management team first thought of self-help measures is to reduce costs, rent, manpower, inventory, decoration, as much as possible to reduce costs.

Before resuming work, chaos and the management team had some initial ideas. For example, several stores scheduled to open in March or April have already been put on hold, delaying the opening of their stores; one person has to be laid off as a last resort, but the management team is already considering half pay or two thirds pay, until the company's cash flow is restored.

Currently, the biggest problem facing the 12 houses is the rent. Disorderly told the interface news, 12 has been in and the major shopping malls to discuss countermeasures, but the market is also facing greater difficulties, it is difficult to be effective. "We would like stores to delay charging, but stores are reluctant to say yes. There are also individual stores that are more difficult to communicate. "

On February 3rd work began on 12 buildings, all of them at home in Florida -- a place where action, no matter how difficult, is needed to make a difference. Disorderly tell interface news, the current to do item by item decomposition, but there is no negative mood.

Before the start of the construction, the management of the twelve buildings through the group of responsible people, told everyone to ensure safety first, and then to ensure the internal stability of the team. A 12-building employee told interface news that at present they are working from home normally, and colleagues are still discussing problems in the group as before. Everyone is quite active.

The biggest hope for chaos is double 11 and double 12, now the inventory can only be sold online, these two festivals are the explosion of online sales, 12 has begun to try to live delivery of goods, in preparation for the second half of the sales.

After a few days of anxiety, Li Xin calmed herself by getting back to work. He is glad last year did not recruit a lot of people, the cash on the company's account is still enough to support the current small team for six months. After the outbreak, many companies will still have to expand their recruitment and change offices, but it will take a while. "We used to visit potential customers often, but now we can use wechat or the telephone to get to know the needs of potential customers and wait for the epidemic to take the initiative. "

Under SARS 17 years ago, the story of Entrepreneurial Enterprise was somewhat similar to today's. For example, "SARS" in Beijing after the outbreak, CTRIP has also fallen into operational difficulties. At that time, ctrip founder Liang Jianzhang on the one hand to stabilize the team morale, on the other hand, taking advantage of the business downturn, let the call center staff to work, grinding process and training. In the wake of the epidemic, the travel industry has experienced "retaliatory" growth, with business volumes in July and August surpassing those before SARS. That December, CTRIP went public on the Nasdaq.

###Keep the cash flowing, stay alive

The sudden outbreak has had a negative impact on companies, but several entrepreneurs and investors have expressed the same view to interface news: It's not scary.

A consumer industry investor told interface news that in the pet industry, for example, the number of online orders has not dropped compared with the same period last year, based on back office data from companies he has invested in, but because employees are still at home in the provinces, the failure to return to large cities such as the upper north has had an impact on compliance efficiency, but the related consumer demand has not weakened significantly.

At present, a large number of start-ups are facing the pressure of cash flow, to maintain cash flow for more than six months is considered to be the key enterprises can survive.

Take the food and beverage industry, which has been most affected, for example. The short-term impact of the outbreak can be divided into several categories. The first kind is to the New Year's Eve dinner as the main brand restaurant, this restaurant General New Year's Eve dinner income will account for half of the income, so affected by the epidemic. The other is conventional food brands, such as Haidilao, as long as it can maintain cash flow for more than six months, the impact is generally controllable.

"The cost of food and beverage is part of the rent, and now many stores can negotiate two months rent-free, and raw materials can be disposed of in a variety of ways, but the actual impact is not as big as you think, " said the investor, "The psychological impact is much greater. "

Wang Ran, the founder of Yikai capital, offered more specific advice to start-ups that had planned to raise capital in June, including making healthy cash flow and minimum cash flow reserves a top priority; Communicate with shareholders as soon as possible to seek first aid; make good use of epidemic time, as far as possible to finance the preparation of the way through telecommuting ahead of time.

After several days of planning, chaos finally put into effect the company's measures to open sources and reduce expenses, and in the evening of February 4 in the form of internal mail to inform all employees. One of the most important is to include chaos and 12 chief executive officer Wang Biao above the level of half pay, while the company suspended long-term research and development projects, priority short-term online development and sales, reduce all unnecessary spending.

Chaos in the internal letter said that in the coming months, the focus of the 12 building will also be to ensure "cash flow" to ensure that the company "survive. ".

At the same time, Beijing, Shanghai and other local governments have launched a number of measures to address the difficulties encountered in the production and operation of enterprises. For example, Beijing encourages large-scale commercial buildings, shopping malls and market operators to provide moderate rent reduction and exemption for small and medium-sized micro-tenants during the epidemic, and all districts may give appropriate financial subsidies to leasing enterprises that take rent reduction and exemption measures. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Human and Social Affairs released four measures on Wednesday to ease the burden on enterprises, including the implementation of the unemployment insurance return policy, the postponement of the adjustment of the Social Insurance Payment Base, the extension of the social insurance payment period, and the implementation of the training fee subsidy policy.

"As long as the epidemic can be contained within two or three months, all the effects will be short-term. In this case, companies will have six months of cash flow and there will be no major operational problems, " the investor said.
