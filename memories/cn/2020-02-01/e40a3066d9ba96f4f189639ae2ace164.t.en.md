At about 5 p.m. , few people were seen in the Songjiazhuang station of the Beijing subway. I went through the turnstile to catch a train that had just pulled in. There were no passengers in the carriage, except for a uniformed staff member.
It was the second day of the New Year. I hurried back to Beijing from Tianjin, fearing the suspension of intercity high-speed trains and road closures. There were few pedestrians on the street and very few vehicles except for the empty buses. The station's public areas are disinfected five times a day, security equipment is disinfected every hour, and all staff wear masks. The whole city seemed to fall silent.
A closed coffee shop

In the past week, I've only gone downstairs a handful of times. Like most people, I had to stay in my room, constantly scrolling through messages and finding something else to do. Although it is more than 1,000 kilometers away from the center of the outbreak in Wuhan, Beijing seems to be facing the enemy, and no one is taking it lightly.

For Sun Lu, a Beijinger, the feeling of this Spring Festival is "no one anywhere! " All the friends' parties, temple fairs, meals and movies from previous years are gone this year. He lives in Fengtai District, where many of his nearby restaurants are closed, and the only place where the action happens is in the supermarket, where he occasionally sees residents lining up to buy vegetables.
The supermarket, which used to be a bustling place, is now very quiet

"I think the prices are quite high. For example, cucumbers, which used to be maybe three or four yuan per catty, are now close to nine yuan, " he told me. As for all the masks are in short supply, whether it is near the neighborhood of the pharmacy, or look for every e-commerce platform, "simply can not buy. ". He also has a concern, heard that a nearby community has been confirmed cases, can only now chat with each other in the group to warn family members, go out to pay attention to safety, as little as possible to go to the place where the cluster.
A sudden outbreak of the disease swept away the atmosphere of Spring Festival celebrations in Beijing. The Forbidden City, which was flooded with 400,000 visitors last year during the Spring Festival holiday, has been closed since the beginning of the first lunar month, with the recovery time still uncertain. In the past, the Lama Temple, which had long queues to burn incense for the New Year, has also been temporarily closed since New Year's Eve. In addition, including temple fairs and other large-scale events have been canceled, has built the decoration, facilities have been demolished.

Fang Li, who lives near Sanyuanqiao, also feels that the taste of this year is much lighter. As usual, their family dinner, which was scheduled for the third and fourth day of the Lunar New Year, was canceled. Interestingly, the neighborhood's restaurants hung up signs selling vegetables, years ago under the full strength of the food store, now had to be placed outside, sold to passers-by.
As of 14:00 on January 31, there were 139 confirmed cases in Beijing, including 1 death, 5 discharge, 133 isolation treatment in municipal designated hospitals. Of the 16 municipal districts, only Fangshan District, Pinggu District, Miyun District and Yanqing District have not reported cases. Fortunately, 80% of these confirmed cases are mild. Residents should not panic, the head of Temple of Earth Hospital in Beijing said recently.
In the shadow of the epidemic, traffic to Beijing is being tightly controlled. From January 26, long-distance passenger trains and tour charters entering and leaving Beijing will be suspended; from January 28 to February 26, passenger trains, including a large number of intercity trains between Beijing and Tianjin, will be temporarily suspended; and on January 30, beijing Capital International Airport cancelled 546 flights between Beijing and Wuhan, Xiangyang, Guangzhou and Shanghai. According to the north China Aviation Authority, flight plans at Beijing Capital International Airport and Daxing airports have changed significantly, with daily flight volumes falling by nearly 10 per cent.

Some people are bored with the holidays, while others are in a state of deep anxiety.
A Didi Express driver said that these days often empty drive two hours to receive a single, from nine in the morning to 10 pm off work, a day run less than 15. "during the Spring Festival, there is a subsidy of 8 yuan per unit, but after the festival, there is no subsidy. If you return the car now, you won't get your deposit back, but Paodi doesn't make any money. " He couldn't help feeling sorry for himself.
So is Wang Jun, a doctor at an Infectious Disease Hospital in Beijing. In fact, he said on Wechat that he had been anxious since the end of December last year, and the feeling has continued until now. Sporadic reports of the outbreak at the time had not been widely noted. Only later, on Dec. 8, did officials identify a man at Wuhan Central Hospital with unidentified pneumonia as the first recorded case. In this way, under the New Year and Spring Festival atmosphere of Wuhan, did not timely alarm, until the situation deteriorated in a flash.
On January 12, I went to Shichahai ice rink in Beijing. The weekend before that, the huge 2,000-seat skating rink had just officially opened. The Ice Skating Rink on the same day is crowded with people, the ticket window is also lined up dozens of meters long line. In the streets of Shichahai, the crowds are thick, the sales are brisk, and there is a festive atmosphere to prepare for the holidays. But just two days ago, the new coronavirus infection pneumonia expert group member Wang Guangfa also said in an interview, the overall epidemic "preventable and controllable. ". But in Wang Jun's view, this claim is unfounded. During that time, his mood became very depressed, "do not want to say anything. ". He didn't think it was something you could just say.
The public's nervousness about the outbreak stems from Zhong Nanshan's "human-to-human" judgment. On Jan. 21, pharmacies near the compound showed signs of panic buying, and while masks and Isatis Tinctoria were still available, stocks were running low. The clerk at the pharmacy said he was coordinating restocking, but it wasn't clear if it would arrive in time. Tao Juan, a doctor at another Infectious Disease Hospital in Beijing, was also keeping a close eye on the development of the epidemic in those days. On New Year's Eve, she happened to be on duty. Around noon, she posted a message on Wechat saying, "thank you very much for the greetings from many people. As she and her colleagues are busy working in the front line, I hope you can give more understanding to the doctor's work. ".
Medical supplies are beginning to breach rapidly. A number of hospitals in Beijing have openly solicited medical supplies from the public. I saw in a group of doctors on Wechat that at present some hospitals only supply N95 masks to fever out-patient and emergency medical workers, while other medical workers are forced to stay behind. On the market, a number of pharmacies contacted said masks and so on have been sold out. Some pharmacies occasionally received a batch of N90-level protective masks, even if they were sold out without packing, they were sold out in a short time.
On the morning of January 30, Beijing held a press conference on epidemic prevention and control. Officials said at the meeting that Beijing had urgently allocated supplies to meet the public's urgent demand for masks, which could be distributed on the same day. So far, however, the situation does not appear to have improved much. On the other hand, the situation remains difficult to be optimistic. According to Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, it is a critical period for the city-wide containment of the new coronavirus, and there is a risk that the virus infection will spread.
And the controls are escalating. Starting from the first train on January 31, the Beijing subway started the temperature measurement work of the whole line network, to test the temperature of passengers entering the station. As the rush back to Beijing approaches, the pressure is on everyone.

Kong Jie returned to Beijing early from her hometown in Hebei Province on Jan. 30 to avoid the peak of rework. She posted a picture of the subway line 10 on her friend's circle. There were only a few people in the car. According to the company schedule, she doesn't need to work in the office for a week after the festival, she can work from home.

But many migrants are not so lucky, they first face how to enter the community and home. Returning from Shanxi Province, Wang Fangfang rented a room in the village of Dongsanqi, a town in the north of Changping district. When she returned to her apartment on the 30th, she was told not to enter. A photograph she forwarded to me from her landlord showed that, according to a notice from the Dongsanqi village committee, people returning to Beijing from other parts of the country had to be quarantined for 14 days and have a health certificate before entering the village.

"No one told me how to open this certificate, the landlord can not say. " On the evening of the 30th, at the other end of the phone screen, Wang Fangfang felt very helpless. "I don't even know where I'm going to stay at night. "
In addition to Dongsanqi village, Pingxifu village, Baxianzhuang village and Baimiao village, which are under the jurisdiction of the seven towns in the north, all issued similar notices, which immediately aroused the dissatisfaction of many tenants.
In a wechat group of more than 300 people, "returning to Beijing to keep warm, " the group members started to spontaneously count all the banned residential list. As of 5 p.m. on Jan. 31, the list included communities in Changping District, Chaoyang District, Haidian District and Shunyi District. "Can not go back" to Beijing, has become a tongue in cheek argument. At the same time, more people are waiting anxiously for the restrictions to be eased.
Tujingjiayuan in Wangzhen, north-west Haidian District, has loosened after some tenants protested resolutely. Originally to the field returned to the Beijing community closed, in the morning of the 31st allowed normal access. "I was finally able to get in, but it was a tortuous process, " said one tenant on the wechat group. "Some people reported to the police and others posted messages on Weibo. " Although it is necessary to apply for a pass every day and sign the relevant commitment letter, but they don't have to worry about being homeless.
On the afternoon of January 31, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs responded that people returning to Beijing from other parts of the country should be free to enter the community as long as they have no confirmed cases of pneumonia or no obvious symptoms. But such a statement did not completely eliminate people's doubts, the wechat group is still controversial. The uncertainty of policy is one of the common misgivings. Be blocked out of Beijing to worry about the return can be quickly resolved, and many have not set foot on the return journey of outsiders, can only constantly self-comfort, solution.
According to the Beijing Municipal Health Commission, grid and carpet management, as well as door-to-door full coverage of the investigation, will be the next key to prevention and control. These measures, including the number of residents reported to the neighborhood, physical condition, as well as recent whether out of Beijing and so on. Faced with the grim situation, on the night of January 31, the government of Beijing issued another notice, except for essential industries, other enterprises to extend normal working hours until February 10. Prior to this, the enterprise must not cause the personnel to gather together and the concentration. As the return to Beijing approaches, the city is nervously preparing.
The tightening of internal controls comes days after a Beijing medical team of 136 medical staff flew to Wuhan in an emergency. They move into the Wuhan Union Hospital, which provides much needed technical support for infection and aspiration. The number of cases in the news is still increasing every day, and no one knows when the epidemic will pass. I've stuffed the fridge with fruits and vegetables, and since there aren't many masks left, I may have to stay indoors for the next few days. Having experienced so much of the hustle and bustle of Beijing in the past, this is a rare and rare feeling.
By the time I finished writing, more and more lights were gradually coming on in the residential building across the street. Everyone was still there, just quietly waiting for the end of the plague.

"No one told me how to open this certificate, the landlord can not say. " On the evening of the 30th, at the other end of the phone screen, Wang Fangfang felt very helpless. "I don't even know where I'm going to stay at night. "

In addition to Dongsanqi village, Pingxifu village, Baxianzhuang village and Baimiao village, which are under the jurisdiction of the seven towns in the north, all issued similar notices, which immediately aroused the dissatisfaction of many tenants.

In a wechat group of more than 300 people, "returning to Beijing to keep warm, " the group members started to spontaneously count all the banned residential list. As of 5 p.m. on Jan. 31, the list included communities in Changping District, Chaoyang District, Haidian District and Shunyi District. "Can not go back" to Beijing, has become a tongue in cheek argument. At the same time, more people are waiting anxiously for the restrictions to be eased.

Tujingjiayuan in Wangzhen, north-west Haidian District, has loosened after some tenants protested resolutely. Originally to the field returned to the Beijing community closed, in the morning of the 31st allowed normal access. "I was finally able to get in, but it was a tortuous process, " said one tenant on the wechat group. "Some people reported to the police and others posted messages on Weibo. " Although it is necessary to apply for a pass every day and sign the relevant commitment letter, but they don't have to worry about being homeless.

On the afternoon of January 31, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs responded that people returning to Beijing from other parts of the country should be free to enter the community as long as they have no confirmed cases of pneumonia or no obvious symptoms. But such a statement did not completely eliminate people's doubts, the wechat group is still controversial. The uncertainty of policy is one of the common misgivings. Be blocked out of Beijing to worry about the return can be quickly resolved, and many have not set foot on the return journey of outsiders, can only constantly self-comfort, solution.

According to the Beijing Municipal Health Commission, grid and carpet management, as well as door-to-door full coverage of the investigation, will be the next key to prevention and control. These measures, including the number of residents reported to the neighborhood, physical condition, as well as recent whether out of Beijing and so on. Faced with the grim situation, on the night of January 31, the government of Beijing issued another notice, except for essential industries, other enterprises to extend normal working hours until February 10. Prior to this, the enterprise must not cause the personnel to gather together and the concentration. As the return to Beijing approaches, the city is nervously preparing.

The tightening of internal controls comes days after a Beijing medical team of 136 medical staff flew to Wuhan in an emergency. They move into the Wuhan Union Hospital, which provides much needed technical support for infection and aspiration. The number of cases in the news is still increasing every day, and no one knows when the epidemic will pass. I've stuffed the fridge with fruits and vegetables, and since there aren't many masks left, I may have to stay indoors for the next few days. Having experienced so much of the hustle and bustle of Beijing in the past, this is a rare and rare feeling.

By the time I finished writing, more and more lights were gradually coming on in the residential building across the street. Everyone was still there, just quietly waiting for the end of the plague.
