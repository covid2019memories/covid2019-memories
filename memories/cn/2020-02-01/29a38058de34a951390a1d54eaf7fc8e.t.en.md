2020.2.1

February came, this just after a month, feel the ups and downs of the plot as if after a whole year, and then if there are blockbuster, psychological quality may be out of practice.

Today, the wind, tomorrow and the next day forecast rain, the residents in the community to dry quilt, fitness equipment covered with colorful quilt blanket. The latest notice has been posted downstairs. There have also been confirmed cases of pneumonia in our community. The property management has informed everyone to do proper disinfection and prevention. Before, we had been watching the news for a long time and mentioned the community's food delivery. Today we finally saw how to deliver food home, tOO UNSANITARY: The security guard borrowed a wheelbarrow from a construction site next door, piled spinach, carrots and eggs directly into the cart, dragged it to the doorway and then carried it upstairs.

More and more people go to the park for recreation, and see the whole family playing badminton at the lake, but the wind is big, badminton is always blown. There were also children playing in the children's Park. I wanted to go on the swing, but I just sat down and didn't go up into the sky. I saw two little girls looking at me through their pink masks. There were only two seats available. I took one of them. They had no place to play, with a few awkward laughs, I quickly got up and walked away.

Fishermen and floaters crouched by the lake in small groups, chatting through masks, and a middle-aged man with a tripod for photography. His Hobby is taking pictures of flowers and plants at home. He said that he was tired of taking pictures of flowers and plants at home, taking advantage of the good weather and the lack of people, take some more pictures of the landscape.

Pharmacies are open, the most common surgical masks are out of stock, fever and cold medicine can not be bought, no disease are early stock, in case of emergency. I asked the staff members that it is not every day on the news that the masks donated from other places are still out of stock. The staff members rolled their big eyes and sent them to the hospital. The hospital is so short, which round will they get to the small dispensary, however, the hospital every day in Weibo friends circle shouted supplies are not enough, ask for support from all sides, another today confused.

In the past seven or eight days of the Spring Festival, most of the residents were running out of stock. In fine weather, they went to the streets to stock up on grain. In supermarkets, buying pork was like playing lotteries. They couldn't guess when it would be put on shelves, or which basket would be filled with pork.

Yesterday, the staff of Hema pushed a large basket of chilled meat to be delivered. It was all beef in the distance. I accurately sifted out the ridges and shreds of meat from the unearthed pigs. My visual inspection was only about ten boxes. I bought two portions each for my parents. The old man was still not used to eating beef and mutton. The fiber was thick, it's hard to chew. When they found the pork hidden in the beef, their eyes shot a green light like they had been hungry for a long time, and they began to rummage through what was left of the soil pork. Slowly, they found only the liver and the cold feet.

On the way home, he was carrying the cristal meat, full of confidence, walking with strength, and suddenly felt that he had become a big family. What he carried in his bag was a treasure. Fortunately, there were enough eggs in the family. The family did not like to eat eggs, and the eggs were snatched quickly in the supermarket, often just from the warehouse out of a few boxes, was immediately taken away by the masses, simply too late to put into the freezer.

Since I returned to Wuhan from Xi'an, I have not put on makeup, and I spend every day without makeup. If I hadn't been out of the House, I would have been too lazy to wash my hair. I had only planned to stay at home for a few days, and all I had in my bag were skin care samples. Now I use them to see the bottom of my head, the result is new also can not buy, home also did not shave eyebrow knife, eyebrow does not repair for more than a week, nurturance"wild eyebrow".

This morning, I couldn't sit still. I heard that tmall and Jd.com were still delivering goods. I decided to buy Taih≈ç and passerine first to save my life. I wanted to moisturize. I also bought a eyebrow trimmer and an ear pick, one told me to deliver it after February 14th.

I have just read the news that "apple has announced the temporary closure of all retail stores on the mainland. " My heart turned to death when I saw the notebook in the rice bag that could not be turned on. I just complained to my friends this morning that there were confirmed cases in Britain and Sweden. I am afraid my application will be ruined, the committee, from China, refused, couldn't get a visa, couldn't get a passport, closed all the Apple stores in the afternoon, even if I had to cut my teeth and buy a new computer.

I had saved up my money to buy the new EarPods, and even thought of buying a switch to play games. Now I am devoted to computer maintenance. I am determined to close my business, there is a kind of real life to be beaten up face of the helpless.

The latest issue of the Make a sound in the east, then strike in the West invites Della Chuang to share her thoughts on designing smells. Della is a scent designer, and unlike a perfumer, who focuses on conceptual and abstract inspiration, a scent designer works with bottles and cans and needs a chemical background, make a perfume out of a designer's concept (I thought it was a career) .

Della's voice is charming and smooth, and Mandarin Chinese sounds a little cute. I took a look at the ideal APP and subscribed to her course, Della's scent library, which I recommend to friends at home. For more than 20 minutes, Della introduced the human history behind a particular smell, and her description of smell was indeed more accurate than the average person's, visualizing the ethereal smell as an image that came to the listener's mind, like Sandalwood in India, she describes "a beautiful Indian woman in a dazzling peacock miniskirt, gazing affectionately at the 100-step snake held in her left hand, breathing a sweet, fresh smell of Sandalwood, the snakes felt the vibrations in the moist air, and willingly left their favorite sandalwood tree to snuggle, Hug, entwine and warm the woman. ".

Also recommended are three timely books on the occasion: Leprosy: a medical social history of a disease, my Liangshan brothers: drugs, AIDS, and mobile youth, and Zhou Xueguang's the institutional logic of governance in China.

The other half of this diary can not be shared, has been showing failure not to check, I admit, just, this is reality.
