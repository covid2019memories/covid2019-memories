##Choice of beds: the difficulty of seeking medical treatment for cancer patients in Wuhan

To-cure-sometimes

The function introduces, records the person and the disease, the senility, the death coexistence way.

The epidemic is severe, Wuhan is still continuously seeking new coronary pneumonia beds. Under heavy pressure, the oncology departments of various hospitals "only go out with difficulty" . Some patients are forced to leave the hospital and seek help through online posts. Others are trying to seek medical treatment outside the province, but are caught between the "admission receipt form" and the "pass" on both sides, hard to find out.

New coronary pneumonia and malignant tumor in the same family

Within a month, Schenen had two requests for help. From getting kits and beds for my father, who was newly infected, to fighting for my mother, who was dying of cancer, to not getting kicked out of the hospital, it boils down to three words: "It's too hard. ".

On January 11, Shi Ning returned to Wuhan from the UK to spend the last Spring Festival with his mother, who was terminally ill with cancer. My mother had been hospitalized for a long time in the back Lake District of Wuhan Central Hospital, the closest TRIPLE-A hospital to the south China Seafood Market.

On January 26 and 27, shining and his father were diagnosed with suspected infection at the fever clinic and started home isolation treatment.

After the traffic control, Shi Ning accompanied his father to ride a bicycle many times between home and the hospital. At the height of the outbreak, the fever clinic was overwhelmed with people. It took hours to queue up for registration, outpatient service and injection at each door. Patients were exhausted from waiting.

With his 67 year old father progressing rapidly, he realized he had to pass a nucleic acid test as soon as possible and find a designated hospital to treat him.

On February 3 and 5, the father and daughter were finally admitted to the hospital after being diagnosed, using all their contacts, posting on social media platforms for help, and recording videos for media coverage.

On February 9, Shi Ning was discharged from the hospital, but his father, who was critically ill when he was admitted, never got better. The hospital began calling to tell Shi Ning to prepare himself psychologically.

On February 13, after media reports of plasma antibody therapy in recovered patients, Shi Ning came up with the idea of using his own plasma to help his father.

The next day, Shi Ning became the first person from Wuhan Jinyintan hospital to voluntarily donate plasma to recover from new pneumonia. Before the plasma preparation was completed, on February 15, shining's father died after unsuccessful ICU rescue.

Shi Ning remember that day Wuhan Just Snow, wind and rain, aunt, cousin call, crying let her go to the hospital another day to deal with his father's funeral.

And the next day from the mother's Hospital News, became overwhelming spirit of the last Straw.

On January 28, after being requisitioned for the new crown pneumonia designated hospital, Shining's mother transferred out twice and finally settled down in the Nanjing Road Hospital area, the main part of the Wuhan Central Hospital.

On February 16, mothers who needed nutritional injections and analgesics to stay alive were again informed that beds were also being taken from the Nanjing Road Hospital area, requiring non-ncp patients to be discharged immediately.

The shining family lives on the 6th floor of an old residential building, and her mother is unable to walk. In Wuhan, she does not know how to pick up her mother safely and send her away safely after her mother's death.

Everything in Wuhan was giving way to the epidemic, Shi understood, and she and her father had been among those who needed beds, but for her mother, leaving the hospital meant losing them.

"If the cost of a bed is to throw away the lives of patients with equally severe tumours, shouldn't a more balanced solution be considered? "

On February 19, Shi Ning told the "occasional cure" that most of the patients still in the hospital were in fact extremely difficult patients. "A number of them had already been discharged before the Chinese New Year. After the outbreak of the epidemic, the nurses also made several rounds of persuasion, after all, stay in the hospital easy cross-infection, can walk almost have been discharged, like my mother is really unable to move. "

In the midst of an epidemic, hospitals are "out and out. "

Wang Jing's father was one of a group of cancer patients released from hospital years ago.

In June 2019, Wang's 65 year old father was diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer and later treated at the Oncology Department of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. After a total gastrectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy, my father's condition was temporarily brought under control. Followed by regular follow-up, check-ups, "basically 15 days a month spent in the hospital. ".

On January 22,2020, Wang Jing checked her father out of the hospital to return to her hometown in Dongkou County, Hunan Province, for the Chinese New Year. The departure time was 4:00 p.m. on January 23. Early this morning, Wuhan announced that it would begin "closing down" the city at 10 o'clock.

Since then, Wang Jing and his mother, son, together with his seriously ill father, together were detained in Wuhan.

February 8th was supposed to be the date of a new round of chemotherapy for Wang Jing's father. She called nearly every hospital in Wuhan, and the responses were mostly: Hospitals are being requisitioned, oncology departments are closed, home care is recommended, or visits outside Hubei Province.

As the days passed, it was Paresthesia for the families of cancer patients.

On Jan. 19,2020, Zhou Qin and her 7 year old son, who had a malignant brain tumor, were admitted to the Oncology Department of Tongji Hospital, affiliated to the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, where they began the sixth stage of chemotherapy.

On February 14, Zhou Qin received a notice from her attending physician that the hospital would stop all radiation and chemotherapy. The child was given chemotherapy every 21 days, four days after the next round of radiation.

"If we don't keep him on radiation, I'm afraid the tumor's GonNa grow back, and all that work will be for nothing. On February 15, Zhou told the group that "occasional healing" was possible.

"Occasional Cure" learned that since February 13, Wuhan Union Hospital, Tongji Hospital and other cancer patients with temporary interruption of treatment, and was forced to discharge from hospital.

On Feb. 13, several cancer patients were rushed out of the hospital.

Behind it, Wuhan needs to complete a reserve of 100,000 new coronary pneumonia beds by February 20. Of these, the number of beds in designated hospitals for the treatment of critically ill patients was set at 14,000.

"Occasional Cure" is aware of an urgent notice issued on 14 February for the requisition of new capo-pneumonia fixed-bed beds requiring the requisition of 3,500 new beds by 15 February, that includes the headquarters of Wuhan Central Hospital (Nanjing Road Hospital) .

According to the notice, Nanjing Road Hospital district emergency in 15,16 to contribute 700 beds in batches, it is at this time, shining mother received an emergency discharge notice.

The new coronary pneumonia and the malignant tumor are like two sides of the same coin, but how should the bed choose?

On February 17, Jiao Yahui, deputy director of the medical and Health Administration Bureau of the National Health Commission, said in an interview with CCTV that the epidemic in Wuhan has lasted for a relatively long time. Due to the lack of timely prevention and control measures, many community cases have not been treated in a timely manner.

"The average length of stay for severe cases from onset to hospitalization was 9.84 days. These 10 days missed the best opportunity for treatment and the waiting period went from mild to severe. Jiao Yahui's frank remarks were well received.

From the early days of Home Quarantine to today's "collection and collection" , there has been a shift in decision-making in the prevention and control of the Wuhan Epidemic. The impact has not only been an increase in the number of clustered cases within families, but also the chances of survival for patients with mild to severe illnesses, even the cancer-fighting fate of non-new coronary pneumonia tumors.

Radiation therapy can not do, Zhou Qin and children are also trapped in the hospital, inch-by-inch difficult. The point is, if you leave now, you can't be admitted again.

The same thing happened at Hubei Cancer Hospital. "In a hospital, patients can only go out, not in. OUT-PATIENT CARE is an emergency. On February 18, a doctor at the hospital told "occasional cure" .

"Just as in a surgical emergency, there is a need to deal with a critical situation immediately, such as radiation, chemotherapy and surgery, which can be scheduled, which can be suspended, which is a problem now faced by all hospitals in Wuhan. "

Supportive care is available for patients who are not discharged, "including symptomatic treatment, Analgesia, and nutritional support, but chemotherapy and radiation are not available. ". "

The reason, the doctor said, "cancer patients with low immunity, radiation and chemotherapy may appear after immunosuppression, at this time, patients with a very high risk of infection with the new coronavirus, once a patient infected, the entire ward is at risk. "

"I get a dozen calls a day, mostly from patients' families. But when it comes to public health, there is no need for a single patient, and the risks are too great. "He repeated.

For cancer patients and their families, the hope part of the story is more likely to be amplified than the risk the hospital is worried about.

Huang Yanzhong, a public health expert, wrote that Wuhan had taken strong preventive and control measures, but that the extra-conventional measures, which he called "urgent and expedient, " had side effects.

"These measures emphasize 'one-stop shopping' and focus all resources and manpower to tackle the new coronavirus, thus leading to neglect of other public health problems or affecting the delivery of normal health services. "

Huang Yanzhong believes that governments at all levels need to weaken the thinking of the war "epidemic" , pay more attention to improving people's livelihood and meeting the health needs of the general public, and seek Dynamic equilibrium between the war "epidemic" and conventional treatment.

The implementation of the designated hospitals is a mystery

The first problem of non-new coronary heart disease is the obstruction of dialysis in patients with renal disease, and even extreme cases of death due to delay in dialysis have been reported.

On February 4, the Hubei Provincial Health Commission released a list of designated hospitals for special patients, including pregnant and lying-in women, children and hemodialysis patients. But patients with malignant tumors were not mentioned.

Before February 19, "occasional cure" called a number of hospitals for consultation, were told, "no outpatient, no beds, can not be collected. Only Wuhan Puren hospital is still carrying out radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

"We have a special ward for pneumonia patients and another ward for cancer patients. However, we will consider the value of treatment depending on whether the patient is in urgent need of treatment. "Wuhan Puren Hospital, a chief physician in the oncology department, said by telephone.

The doctor also said that in the Health Commission did not require the situation, whether to accept or not all go with the flow, "unlike kidney dialysis has fixed-point admission hospital, tumor patients, this area, Wuhan Health Commission did not make uniform requirements. ". "

When asked if he was worried about cross-infection with the new coronavirus, the doctor explained, "first, for patients with new coronavirus, we have seven or eight wards all in the old building, tumor patients in the new building, the new building is separated from the old building; Second, before admission, the patient will be examined for blood routine and chest CT, and the new crown suspected patients will be excluded. The family members will also be monitored for body temperature, including Health Education for doctors and patients, Health Education for family members, we are doing. "

In desperation, Zhou Qin asked her relatives to send a message on Weibo asking for help.

At 13:14 on February 16, Zhou Qin's relatives tweeted, "because the sound is very high, the policy came down and just informed the hospital that radiation therapy can be done tomorrow. ". The tweet asking for help was also deleted.

On February 18, Zhou Qin was contacted by "occasional cure" . "The child did not undergo chemotherapy. He said yes in the morning, but not in the afternoon. According to Zhou Qin's knowledge, Tongji hospital originally intended to resume radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but received a government notice on the evening of February 17, and first carried out a large screening to exclude suspected patients of new pneumonia, recovery or not, after three days to reply.

Another piece of good news is that on February 18, the head of the Oncology Department of Wuhan Puren Hospital also agreed to admit Zhou Qin's child.

Suddenly appeared two hope, Zhou Qin Xinran wait.

On the evening of February 16, after learning of her mother's situation, her Wuhan Foreign Languages School Alumni sent out messages asking for help through social media platforms such as Douban and Weibo, attracting wide attention. "Occasional Cure" was informed that the hospital has now no longer urge patients to discharge.

However, the change of the request for help shows that with the implementation of "receivable collection" , contradictions or start to shift.

On February 19, a volunteer who had been in charge of reporting a call for help from a patient with new crown pneumonia told "occasional cure" that the call for help from a new crown had dropped significantly and that she had begun to report the information she had received from a non-new crown.

The good news: On the night of February 18, Wuhan released a list of hospitals for the treatment of special patients with non-new coronary pneumonia, adding a column for hospitals for the treatment of malignant tumors (including tumor of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues) and chronic diseases, they include: Hubei Provincial Cancer Hospital, Tongji Hospital (headquarters) , Union Hospital (headquarters) , Wuhan University People's Hospital (headquarters) , central war zone General Hospital and Hankou Hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital Nanjing Road Hospital, Wuhan Chinese Medicine Hospital Shengli Street Hospital, Wuhan Puren Hospital, Wuhan Sixth Hospital.

On 19 February, "occasional cure" contacted a number of staff members of the above nine hospitals and was informed that the implementation of the notification has yet to be speeded up.

As of the evening of February 19, incomplete statistics of nine hospital oncology admission

Arrangement: Yang Yuan, cartography: Fu Pingfan

Union hospital doctors said that because the hospital many hospital areas have been levied as a new crown fixed-point hospital, can no longer admit cancer patients.

Wuhan Central Hospital said it had received the notification, but the new crown patient has not yet been discharged from hospital, even after the need to first disinfection, specific admission time can not be determined.

In line with Zhou Qin's remarks, Tongji Hospital said that from February 17 to 19, all hospitals in Wuhan were conducting a network-type screening to screen patients suspected of new crown pneumonia. Therefore, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have not been carried out, and patients with tumors have not yet been admitted, treatment is expected to begin on February 20, with the resumption of radiation and chemotherapy.

However, in order to prevent cross-infection needs to control the ward density, the original 300 beds down the total number of patients will not exceed 200.

Even so, not all cancer patients can be admitted, and some doctors say the epidemic will now favor those who progress relatively quickly, like lymphoma. For patients who can take chemotherapy orally, hospitalization is generally not recommended.

That I couldn't get

If I don't make it through the next 14 days, I'll live with it. After numerous phone calls were rejected, Wang told the "occasional cure" that "there is no hope at all in Wuhan. "

Hope is what this family in Wuhan has been searching for for nearly 20 days, even in the worst case scenario that he would die during the 14 days he spent in isolation after arriving in Changsha.

For the father of Terminal Cancer, home care is basically equivalent to giving up treatment, Wang Jing decided to take his father back to Hunan.

Hunan is right next to Hubei and can drive directly from the province via Beijing–Hong Kong–Macau Expressway. However, due to traffic control, all the roads out of Han were closed, and the "pass" issued by the epidemic prevention and control headquarters was the only valid certificate for leaving the province.

Wang Jing to Wuhan Qiao Estuary Epidemic Prevention Command Center to apply, but learned that the premise of issuing a pass, is to receive the hospital to first issue a receipt.

However, Wang Consulted Xiangya Hospital in Changsha, Shaoyang People's Hospital and Dongkou County People's Hospital respectively. They all said they needed to assess the patient's condition first and rule out new crown pneumonia, otherwise they would not issue the acceptance certificate.

On February 15, Xiangya hospital hotline confirmed to occasional cure that before issuing the admission certificate, the patient needed to have a chest CT and nucleic acid test to rule out the risk of new crown infection, which could only be done by the patient himself, the inspection list of the Outer Court shall not be counted.

Even if the Qiao estuary community had opened a series of temperature records for Wang Jing's father, this would not be evidence that he had not contracted new pneumonia.

On February 18, "occasional cure" called the Wuhan Qiao Estuary Epidemic Prevention Command Center on the issue, and the center's staff said that the issuance of the Han exit permit is conditional on a receipt from the local government. This certificate is a government letter and the receipt certificate issued by the hospital does not count.

As for whether there is a precedent for leaving the province to seek medical treatment based on a pass, the staff said they were only responsible for informing the process and did not track whether they could successfully leave the country.

One side of the hospital to receive a certificate to issue a pass, on the other side of the patient can not be local to receive a certificate. Caught in the middle of the Wang Jing family, can not find a way out.

As of February 20, nearly 30 days have passed since the city of Wuhan was closed, and the epidemic has not yet reached a definite turning point. However, for more patients with non-new-crown pneumonia, whether seeking admission to a hospital in Wuhan, or break through the traffic blockade to seek medical treatment outside the province, are still fraught with difficulties.

New coronary pneumonia and malignant tumor in the same family

Within a month, Schenen had two requests for help. From getting kits and beds for my father, who was newly infected, to fighting for my mother, who was dying of cancer, to not getting kicked out of the hospital, it boils down to three words: "It's too hard. ".

On January 11, Shi Ning returned to Wuhan from the UK to spend the last Spring Festival with his mother, who was terminally ill with cancer.

Behind it, Wuhan needs to complete a reserve of 100,000 new coronary pneumonia beds by February 20. Of these, the number of beds in designated hospitals for the treatment of critically ill patients was set at 14,000.

"Occasional Cure" is aware of an urgent notice issued on 14 February for the requisition of new capo-pneumonia fixed-bed beds requiring the requisition of 3,500 new beds by 15 February, that includes the headquarters of Wuhan Central Hospital (Nanjing Road Hospital) .

According to the notice, Nanjing Road Hospital district emergency in 15,16 to contribute 700 beds in batches, it is at this time, shining mother received an emergency discharge notice.

The new coronary pneumonia and the malignant tumor are like two sides of the same coin, but how should the bed choose?

On February 17, Jiao Yahui, deputy director of the medical and Health Administration Bureau of the National Health Commission, said in an interview with CCTV that the epidemic in Wuhan has lasted for a relatively long time. Due to the lack of timely prevention and control measures, many community cases have not been treated in a timely manner.

"The average length of stay for severe cases from onset to hospitalization was 9.84 days. These 10 days missed the best opportunity for treatment and the waiting period went from mild to severe. Jiao Yahui's frank remarks were well received.

From the early days of Home Quarantine to today's "collection and collection" , there has been a shift in decision-making in the prevention and control of the Wuhan Epidemic. The impact has not only been an increase in the number of clustered cases within families, but also the chances of survival for patients with mild to severe illnesses, even the cancer-fighting fate of non-new coronary pneumonia tumors.

Radiation therapy can not do, Zhou Qin and children are also trapped in the hospital, inch-by-inch difficult. The point is, if you leave now, you can't be admitted again.

The same thing happened at Hubei Cancer Hospital. "In a hospital, patients can only go out, not in. OUT-PATIENT CARE is an emergency. On February 18, a doctor at the hospital told "occasional cure" .

"Just as in a surgical emergency, there is a need to deal with a critical situation immediately, such as radiation, chemotherapy and surgery, which can be scheduled, which can be suspended, which is a problem now faced by all hospitals in Wuhan. "

Supportive care is available for patients who are not discharged, "including symptomatic treatment, Analgesia, and nutritional support, but chemotherapy and radiation are not available. ". "

The reason, the doctor said, "cancer patients with low immunity, radiation and chemotherapy may appear after immunosuppression, at this time, patients with a very high risk of infection with the new coronavirus, once a patient infected, the entire ward is at risk. "

"I get a dozen calls a day, mostly from patients' families. But when it comes to public health, there is no need for a single patient, and the risks are too great. "He repeated.

For cancer patients and their families, the hope part of the story is more likely to be amplified than the risk the hospital is worried about.

Huang Yanzhong, a public health expert, wrote that Wuhan had taken strong preventive and control measures, but that the extra-conventional measures, which he called "urgent and expedient, " had side effects.

"These measures emphasize 'one-stop shopping' and focus all resources and manpower to tackle the new coronavirus, thus leading to neglect of other public health problems or affecting the delivery of normal health services. "

Huang Yanzhong believes that governments at all levels need to weaken the thinking of the war "epidemic" , pay more attention to improving people's livelihood and meeting the health needs of the general public, and seek Dynamic equilibrium between the war "epidemic" and conventional treatment.

The implementation of the designated hospitals is a mystery

The first problem of non-new coronary heart disease is the obstruction of dialysis in patients with renal disease, and even extreme cases of death due to delay in dialysis have been reported.

On February 4, the Hubei Provincial Health Commission released a list of designated hospitals for special patients, including pregnant and lying-in women, children and hemodialysis patients. But patients with malignant tumors were not mentioned.

Before February 19, "occasional cure" called a number of hospitals for consultation, were told, "no outpatient, no beds, can not be collected. Only Wuhan Puren hospital is still carrying out radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

"We have a special ward for pneumonia patients and another ward for cancer patients. However, we will consider the value of treatment depending on whether the patient is in urgent need of treatment. "Wuhan Puren Hospital, a chief physician in the oncology department, said by telephone.

The doctor also said that in the Health Commission did not require the situation, whether to accept or not all go with the flow, "unlike kidney dialysis has fixed-point admission hospital, tumor patients, this area, Wuhan Health Commission did not make uniform requirements. ". "

When asked if he was worried about cross-infection with the new coronavirus, the doctor explained, "first, for patients with new coronavirus, we have seven or eight wards all in the old building, tumor patients in the new building, the new building is separated from the old building; Second, before admission, the patient will be examined for blood routine and chest CT, and the new crown suspected patients will be excluded. The family members will also be monitored for body temperature, including Health Education for doctors and patients, Health Education for family members, we are doing. "

In desperation, Zhou Qin asked her relatives to send a message on Weibo asking for help.

At 13:14 on February 16, Zhou Qin's relatives tweeted, "because the sound is very high, the policy came down and just informed the hospital that radiation therapy can be done tomorrow. ". The tweet asking for help was also deleted.

On February 18, Zhou Qin was contacted by "occasional cure" . "The child did not undergo chemotherapy. He said yes in the morning, but not in the afternoon. According to Zhou Qin's knowledge, Tongji hospital originally intended to resume radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but received a government notice on the evening of February 17, and first carried out a large screening to exclude suspected patients of new pneumonia, recovery or not, after three days to reply.

Another piece of good news is that on February 18, the head of the Oncology Department of Wuhan Puren Hospital also agreed to admit Zhou Qin's child.

Suddenly appeared two hope, Zhou Qin Xinran wait.

On the evening of February 16, after learning of her mother's situation, her Wuhan Foreign Languages School Alumni sent out messages asking for help through social media platforms such as Douban and Weibo, attracting wide attention. "Occasional Cure" was informed that the hospital has now no longer urge patients to discharge.

However, the change of the request for help shows that with the implementation of "receivable collection" , contradictions or start to shift.

On February 19, a volunteer who had been in charge of reporting a call for help from a patient with new crown pneumonia told "occasional cure" that the call for help from a new crown had dropped significantly and that she had begun to report the information she had received from a non-new crown.

The good news: On the night of February 18, Wuhan released a list of hospitals for the treatment of special patients with non-new coronary pneumonia, adding a column for hospitals for the treatment of malignant tumors (including tumor of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues) and chronic diseases, they include: Hubei Provincial Cancer Hospital, Tongji Hospital (headquarters) , Union Hospital (headquarters) , Wuhan University People's Hospital (headquarters) , central war zone General Hospital and Hankou Hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital Nanjing Road Hospital, Wuhan Chinese Medicine Hospital Shengli Street Hospital, Wuhan Puren Hospital, Wuhan Sixth Hospital.

On 19 February, "occasional cure" contacted a number of staff members of the above nine hospitals and was informed that the implementation of the notification has yet to be speeded up.

As of the evening of February 19, incomplete statistics of nine hospital oncology admission

Union hospital doctors said that because the hospital many hospital areas have been levied as a new crown fixed-point hospital, can no longer admit cancer patients.

Wuhan Central Hospital said it had received the notification, but the new crown patient has not yet been discharged from hospital, even after the need to first disinfection, specific admission time can not be determined.

In line with Zhou Qin's remarks, Tongji Hospital said that from February 17 to 19, all hospitals in Wuhan were conducting a network-type screening to screen patients suspected of new crown pneumonia. Therefore, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have not been carried out, and patients with tumors have not yet been admitted, treatment is expected to begin on February 20, with the resumption of radiation and chemotherapy.

However, in order to prevent cross-infection needs to control the ward density, the original 300 beds down the total number of patients will not exceed 200.

Even so, not all cancer patients can be admitted, and some doctors say the epidemic will now favor those who progress relatively quickly, like lymphoma. For patients who can take chemotherapy orally, hospitalization is generally not recommended.

That I couldn't get

If I don't make it through the next 14 days, I'll live with it. After numerous phone calls were rejected, Wang told the "occasional cure" that "there is no hope at all in Wuhan. "

Hope is what this family in Wuhan has been searching for for nearly 20 days, even in the worst case scenario that he would die during the 14 days he spent in isolation after arriving in Changsha.

For the father of Terminal Cancer, home care is basically equivalent to giving up treatment, Wang Jing decided to take his father back to Hunan.

Hunan is right next to Hubei and can drive directly from the province via Beijing–Hong Kong–Macau Expressway. However, due to traffic control, all the roads out of Han were closed, and the "pass" issued by the epidemic prevention and control headquarters was the only valid certificate for leaving the province.

Wang Jing to Wuhan Qiao Estuary Epidemic Prevention Command Center to apply, but learned that the premise of issuing a pass, is to receive the hospital to first issue a receipt.

However, Wang Consulted Xiangya Hospital in Changsha, Shaoyang People's Hospital and Dongkou County People's Hospital respectively. They all said they needed to assess the patient's condition first and rule out new crown pneumonia, otherwise they would not issue the acceptance certificate.

On February 15, Xiangya hospital hotline confirmed to occasional cure that before issuing the admission certificate, the patient needed to have a chest CT and nucleic acid test to rule out the risk of new crown infection, which could only be done by the patient himself, the inspection list of the Outer Court shall not be counted.

Even if the Qiao estuary community had opened a series of temperature records for Wang Jing's father, this would not be evidence that he had not contracted new pneumonia.

On February 18, "occasional cure" called the Wuhan Qiao Estuary Epidemic Prevention Command Center on the issue, and the center's staff said that the issuance of the Han exit permit is conditional on a receipt from the local government. This certificate is a government letter and the receipt certificate issued by the hospital does not count.

As for whether there is a precedent for leaving the province to seek medical treatment based on a pass, the staff said they were only responsible for informing the process and did not track whether they could successfully leave the country.

One side of the hospital to receive a certificate to issue a pass, on the other side of the patient can not be local to receive a certificate. Caught in the middle of the Wang Jing family, can not find a way out.

As of February 20, nearly 30 days have passed since the city of Wuhan was closed, and the epidemic has not yet reached a definite turning point. However, for more patients with non-new-crown pneumonia, whether seeking admission to a hospital in Wuhan, or break through the traffic blockade to seek medical treatment outside the province, are still fraught with difficulties.
