Britain's prime minister, Boris Johnson, has drawn up a controversial new anti epidemic policy as Italy blockades its territory and France announces school closures. Although he announced the second phase of the UK epidemic on March 12th, the three main policies he announced were self-imposed quarantine for people with fever or cough, and the cancellation of overseas travel by schools, people over the age of 70 or with health problems should not take a cruise, and the importance of hand washing to prevent new pneumonia has been repeatedly stressed.

Meanwhile, the number of new cases of pneumonia in the UK continues to rise, with 798 cases confirmed as of 0900 hours local time on March 13. But Pattrick Valeins, the government's chief scientific adviser, said the actual number of infections in the UK was probably between 5,000 and 10,000. As the UK enters a new phase of its epidemic prevention campaign, the government has said it will no longer test patients with mild symptoms who are required to be quarantined at home, and the new coronavirus test will only be carried out on those who are seriously ill and admitted to hospital.

The UK government has previously published an action plan against the disease, divided into four stages: containment, delay, research and impairment. As the number of infections has risen, the fight against the disease has moved from containment to procrastination, that is, how to slow the spread of the virus in the UK and reduce the impact of reaching peak levels.

Johnson described the new pneumonia as "the worst public health crisis in a generation" , but said the timing of tougher measures was important so no announcement was made about the closure of schools or the end of mass rallies. On the choice of whether to close schools, Johnson said: "The scientific advice is that doing so now would do more harm than good. "

Compared with the policy vigour of other countries, Britain's approach has attracted criticism. The former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, criticised the Johnson Administration for failing to act when the UK was just four weeks away from Italy. Richard Holden, editor-in-chief of the Lancet, the world's leading medical journal, said the government was making a big mistake by "playing roulette" with public health in a country that desperately needs social distancing and closure policies.

But Valeins said the government was now taking steps to ease the peak of the epidemic and help create a herd immunity in the UK. Because most infected people have mild disease, they can develop immunity to a particular group after cure, making more people immune to the new pneumonia, he said. VALEINS estimates that around 60% of the population will not become immunised until the virus is cured, a figure that has been disputed by various interpretations.

Chen Zhengming, a professor of epidemiology at University of Oxford, told Caijing that the government's approach was sometimes callous and rational, but that it took into account the country's circumstances and public psychology. He said more measures are being prepared in the UK, but it is an important consideration for the British government when these measures will be implemented for maximum effect, that, though, makes Britain's approach seem incomprehensible when compared with China's and the rest of Europe's.

"The biggest lesson for Wuhan is that it can't squeeze out medical resources and can't infect doctors, which is very critical, " Chen said.

CAIJING: compared with the closure of schools in France and the closure of the whole country in Italy, is the British government's response too dismissive?

Chen Zhengming: officially, it's based on science, but there are already some different voices at the level of scientists. Both the Lancet editor and the former health secretary disagree about the government's actions, saying they have done too little. It was supposed to be something bigger, such as closing schools, restricting or cancelling large gatherings of people such as sporting events, concerts, or having clear rules, such as Germany cancelling under 1,000 events. So Johnson's announcement faces different voices at home.

In my view, the current policy may be more about minimizing the impact on the economy and on people's lives, but these measures will change sooner or later, because the UK epidemic is still in a rapidly rising phase. Now the UK epidemic prevention work has entered the second phase, that is to reduce the damage phase. The first phase is to try to keep the virus out, and in February the UK basically tried to contain the virus by early screening, diagnosing and isolating people who had been exposed to it. Now that there is a large community spread, it may not be enough, and hopefully most people will be able to get through it without a sudden mass run on the health system. It is also reasonable to treat patients according to their severity, as is the case in China and Italy.

CAIJING: one of the British government's strategies is to create a herd immunity against the virus, but is it too risky in the absence of a vaccine?

Chen Zhengming: So the British strategy was too risky and rational, and now Germany is doing the same. It's totally different from the way the east plays, can't hold it off, brings you in. Can this virus be eliminated? It is not the same as SARS, SARS infection after a high fever, high fever after the infection, and finally the virus disappeared. But the new coronavirus is a protracted war, the final elimination of the virus there are two ways, one is the vaccine out as soon as possible, which is promising, but certainly not before the summer. The other is like the Spanish flu, which came in three waves, and then died because there were so many people infected, and everyone became immune. Some people die after infection, others are cured, recover, develop immunity, and the risk of transmission slowly diminishes until it finally dies.

Now the British government is adopting the same idea. At some point, the government should do more, but there may be no way to do what Asia, such as China, has done. China is a big force, cutting the Gordian knot quickly, but the cost is also high. China's measures also came at a particular time, just during the Spring Festival, when everyone was on vacation, and the shutdown had already taken place, so the shutdown continued to control the epidemic. If we were to shut down 1.4 billion people under normal circumstances, I think it would be very difficult to do that. Different countries have different situations, different time points and infection situations, and different starting points. Therefore, there are various ways to deal with the situation, which are suitable for each country, but each has its own advantages and disadvantages. There is no perfect plan.

CAIJING: The British government says it made these policies based on science, probability and models, but the new coronavirus is a brand new virus. What if the algorithm isn't accurate enough to make a bad decision?

Chen Zhengming: although it is possible, but now the coefficient of the virus is basically clear. The R0 regeneration coefficient, which is the number of people a person can infect, is about three or four. Previously the transmission coefficient was less than three, and the number of people infected doubled in about six days, but now it has doubled in Britain and Italy in four days. In reality, it could be more serious, with a spread factor of three to four. Based on this curve, it's pretty predictable, so now it's just a matter of delaying. The first is that through propaganda, the people themselves take some action, so as to minimize the damage to the economy, because once the government comes forward, the government will have to pay for a lot of things, and economic policy and political policy are closely related. There are a lot of economic considerations here, and each country has its own situation.

The other is that the UK is bound to take some extreme measures, as Italy did, but it has to assess when they were taken and how well they are tolerated. As China's level of the city certainly can not be closed, the Chinese people have a strong tolerance, cooperation, a big picture. The British people can't do it, so the British government wants to use it at the most critical moment. Such considerations have some merit, but they may also be inaccurate and may underestimate the public's awareness.

Science is not set in stone. There are certainly different voices, and we have heard different opinions. So from the individual point of view, there is no need to listen to the government, according to their own knowledge and judgment, what measures should be taken and what measures should be taken. A lot of people may still be singing and dancing and doing what they're supposed to do, and it may not work out in the end, but it may be a couple of weeks before they start cursing. But others are more vigilant, minimizing face-to-face contact, and doing what you can while trying to live a normal life. It's a sensible and rational thing to do. In fact, the response of the society has become increasingly strong, even if the government does not speak, the people will have their own judgment. Nevertheless, there is no great panic in society. The state should do the state, the community should do the community, and the individual should do the individual. Find a more balanced program.

CAIJING: Johnson's advisers say the UK could be facing the same situation as Italy in four weeks'time, and to what extent can the NHS cope?

Chen Zhengming: the situation in the UK will definitely worsen and spread, but my personal judgment is probably not so bad as to whether it will develop into the situation in Italy. First, the early infection curve shows that Italy started out better than the UK, with almost zero growth, followed by a sudden outbreak, suggesting that containment was not done well enough and that communities had spread undetected. Early steps were also taken in the UK, some of which were brought under control in a timely manner. Although this may still be insufficient compared with Singapore, there was no significant increase at least in February.

Italy seems to be very calm, except for imported cases at the end of January, there has been little since then. Italy was the first country to declare a state of emergency and the first to cut off flights to China, and the last to suffer the most. Because the time point of the policy adopted is not well grasped, or it is well grasped but not strong enough, because it is not like the outbreak in Wuhan, everyone has a false sense of security, feel fine, do what you have to do. Italy held a lot of events in February, Venice carnival, Milan fashion week, the marathon will be held as usual.

This kind of gathering group activity spread very badly, close contact and mutual exchange, become the best place for the virus to spread. The virus began to spread rapidly, and it began to become more likely among young people, who did not have obvious symptoms and were able to carry it off. Slowly spreading to the elderly, the real problem erupts. Italy is the oldest country in Europe and has a huge impact on health care. Another problem in Italy is regional clustering, with Lombardy 见 Lombardia，Reg. Accounting for 60 to 70 per cent of cases. Although this is the richest part of Italy, no amount of medical resources can keep up with the flood of patients. The UK wants the cases to be spread fairly evenly and not have a severe drain on health resources in one place.

I don't think that's going to happen in the UK like it did in Italy. The first is age, the UK's age structure is relatively less ageing, the second is relatively more evenly distributed, and the third is that although infection in the UK is also worsening, the spread of early cases is not as rapid as in Italy, that's a lot of prep time. The outbreak in the UK is likely to develop three to four weeks later than in Italy and hospitals are making the necessary preparations. Now there are two steps. One is to postpone the surgery, which is not life-threatening, but it will cause some secondary medical harm. In addition, patient selection may have to be done as in Italy. Treatment is not by first come, first served, but according to the condition, when breathing machine or extracorporeal pulmonary circulation instrument is not enough, for who to use. It's cruel, but there's no way.

CAIJING: The British government has abandoned testing for all suspected cases of mild illness, but it could also increase the risk of transmission in the community. Is that a wise decision?

Chen Zhengming: The British government's approach is difficult for China to understand. It is determined by its politics, its society, and sometimes its almost callous rational calm. It's based on probability theory, and it expects the public to cooperate if necessary. The UK is a civil society, diagnosing a case in which it is impossible to publish the patient's full course of action, and in the East it is a sign of vigilance that is not possible for the sake of privacy. You don't know where it's happening, which makes it a lot harder to control.

But right now, the policy is to quarantine anyone who shows symptoms, and I think the public will respect that. After two months of awareness of the disease is still very important, television is also promoting a variety of health precautions, wash hands, but did not say to wear a mask. There are objective and subjective reasons, one is the shortage of masks, the other is the spread of viruses through droplets, as long as a certain distance, so the emphasis on hand-washing has its scientific rationale.

"CAIJING" : to give up the test for mild illness because of the lack of detection ability?

Chen Zhengming: I don't think so. It's a British strategy. In fact, more than a dozen testing centres were opened in the UK in February and are now capable of testing between 10,000 and 20,000 a day. The number of detections can reflect the severity of the epidemic, but all to test, the results show that a positive may not go to the hospital, because it depends on the condition. If it's mild, stay at home, because 80% of people are immune to it. Some of them didn't make it to the hospital. This may seem like a callous, rational calmness, but it makes sense, because of the number of infections and the trade-offs that have to be made. Isolated at home, Britain is better off than China, because the population density is lower, the home usually has a few rooms, divided into upstairs and downstairs. But you can't know what's going on without testing.

"CAIJING" : Before Wuhan is also a mild illness at home isolation, but this led to more infections, so later to build a shelter hospital centralized treatment, Wuhan Experience for the United Kingdom without reference?

Chen Zhengming: the biggest reference meaning of Wuhan is not to squeeze medical resources, not to let the doctor infection, this is very critical. Patients who go into the shelter are rarely treated, and most don't need treatment to get out of the hospital. But by setting up a shelter hospital, unnecessary community transmission was reduced. Does the UK need it? We may not need it just yet. One is that the UK is not quite there yet. The other is that the UK may not need to do so because of its low community density and better living conditions. In the UK, the emphasis is on home quarantine, family must be isolated, in the hope that there will not be too many families gathered cross-infection. There will be, but the extent of the damage is unclear.

CAIJING: Is it useful to wear a mask to prevent new coronary pneumonia? Why are the UK and China drawing different conclusions?

Chen Zhengming: The culture in Britain and Europe is to wear a mask when you are sick. Chinese who wear masks are beaten or discriminated against, sometimes because they think you are sick and run around outside, leading to misunderstanding and conflict. But as the epidemic expands, so will it. Especially in densely populated areas, some people are now wearing masks.

CAIJING: Do you wear a mask?

Chen Zhengming: I didn't wear it. First, the number of people infected in Britain is still small, the proportion is still small, and scattered in different places. Second, personal protection. It doesn't make much sense to wear a mask now, because the UK population density is not very high. Droplet spread is usually only one or two meters away, the most critical is to wash your hands. A lot of research has been done before, with bird flu and previous flu, and it turns out that wearing a mask and not washing your hands doesn't stop the virus from spreading. People who wear masks incorrectly or don't replace them, or don't wash their hands after wearing them, can increase the risk of infection.

Another problem is that masks are hard to find now. Although you have a mask, you should use it when you need it. Now try to keep your social distance and your contact to a minimum. Everyone's on their toes, but to a certain extent, it still works.

CAIJING: Are the four stages of containment, delay, research, and impairment the usual model for dealing with infectious disease outbreaks in the UK?

Chen Zhengming: not exactly. The UK will certainly have some policies in place, especially in the face of a pandemic, but they will first have to be based on the epidemiological characteristics of the epidemic, its hazards and its mode of transmission. In the past, mad cow disease spread through different routes, and in the worst case scenario, a million people might get infected, but they didn't. This time it's probably 70 to 80 percent, 500,000 people are going to die, and that's the worst case scenario, and I don't think it's going to be that bad. But the worst case scenario, and then see what happens at each stage, how to deal with, according to national strength, to find the benefits of maximum, minimize the harm of the response, Britain can not do as China does without cost. China's national conditions are different, China is an all-powerful government, the people are relatively co-operative, the outbreak is relatively concentrated in Wuhan.

Britain's four-phase action plan is based on the epidemic, now into the second phase, but the second phase is not set in stone, measures will be phased out. Research is interspersed at all stages, not only in the UK, but also with international experience. The main reason for the delay now is that the impact on the UK health system has not been felt particularly badly. But looking back two weeks from now, the pressure on the NHS may be different, but try to hope for a soft landing, not a hard one, leading to a collapse of the health system, as is the case in Italy.

The second phase of the policy will be divided into three levels. It is still at the primary level. Although it has already entered the delayed stage, the policies it has put in place are still only a little bit superficial. Drastic measures have not yet been put in place, such as suspension from school, suspension from the market, suspension from work, etc. , or shut down the city. It's all possible, it's all planned, it's all on the line. But it's hard to say when. France is a bit more serious than the UK, a week or two ahead of the UK in terms of prevalence. There are social psychology considerations, France to this time, we are afraid, a shot we are easy to accept. But Britain is not there yet. If you cry wolf now, no one will believe you when the real wolf comes. This is a very important starting point. Wuhan and Italy are always so far away that most people don't realize how serious they are.

But in a week, if the epidemic continues to worsen and now doubles every four days, the next step may be to consider cancelling some major events, such as sporting events and concerts. If the government now announced the cancellation of public activities, it is bound to have a refund, refund on the business impact is very large. But oneself does not go is own matter, the loss bears by oneself. So the current measures are to minimize social and economic shocks. Next may be suspended, closed, and finally to see whether or not to close the city. I expect there will be these different stages, and I hope it doesn't come to this. But Fengcheng is also a nominal city, the Italian city and the degree of the city of Wuhan is not the same.

CAIJING: The British government has introduced a panel of behavioral psychologists into its decision making, which relies heavily on models that predict people's behavior, and the resulting policy response is quite different from that of other countries. How do you see the role of this group?

Chen Zhengming: There are pros and cons to many things. Sometimes it may be a bit dogmatic, but it can not be completely ignored. The closure of the city in Italy, for example, seemed like a good response, but the children were suspended from school, who would take care of them? Although close contact with the school has been reduced, some of these children come home and need to be taken care of by the elderly, thus increasing the risk of transmission from the child to the elderly. If need parents to take care of, parents is a doctor how to do, medical resources are already very tight. Another consideration is how long the lockdown will last. China has reached the limit. If it goes on, everyone will go crazy. In Britain and Italy, the situation is different. Once it is over, they all go on holiday, which increases the chances of population movement and infection. It's a tricky question, but many are not so simple and have two sides.

Estimates of people's tolerance are based on previous studies, and at particular times, people's tolerance may be different. But a two-month British blockade is out of the question. Two or three weeks may be the limit, but when will those three weeks be used? Wait until the peak time, we are prepared, also accepted. This may not be an acceptable time, but if we take an effective action when the time comes, everyone will cooperate. There's some science to this, but it seems a little too rational and calm, but there's no way, like in war, there's always a trade-off.

CAIJING: But from the Chinese point of view, it's still a little hard to understand.

Chen Zhengming: It is more difficult to understand. China does have a lot to learn from, but it can not and can not do the same in a different context. China is an all-powerful government, and the people are co-operating and in step. This is a civil society, must interact, so the introduction of policy needs to balance all aspects of the factors. Unless there is an extreme state of emergency, then it is natural to adopt policies, but now is not the time.

So many people in China don't quite understand. After the outbreak, we can also discuss, different social management model, pros and cons, is very complex. Some people say that China's epidemic prevention is biology plus political science, which should take into account many political and biological factors. China is hoping for a war of annihilation, complete eradication of the virus. The West, such as Britain and Germany, is "dancing with the disease" and fighting a protracted war.

CAIJING: What can the British government do now to strengthen its response capacity?

Chen Zhengming: the Policy Angle has entered the second stage of epidemic prevention. It may be two or three months before we can make a scientific assessment of whether current policies are right or wrong. The government has its reasons, but some people have different opinions. It is hard to say whether it is the most reasonable until the epidemic has passed. The same is true of different modes of epidemic prevention. China runs the 100-meter dash across the line, but new papers are handed out. The UK sees it as a marathon, with a slow jog and no rush to finish, so it's too early to do anything about it. All we can do is protect ourselves.

Britain's prime minister, Boris Johnson, has drawn up a controversial new anti epidemic policy as Italy blockades its territory and France announces school closures. Although he announced the second phase of the UK epidemic on March 12th, the three main policies he announced were self-imposed quarantine for people with fever or cough, and the cancellation of overseas travel by schools, people over the age of 70 or with health problems should not take a cruise, and the importance of hand washing to prevent new pneumonia has been repeatedly stressed.

Meanwhile, the number of new cases of pneumonia in the UK continues to rise, with 798 cases confirmed as of 0900 hours local time on March 13. But Pattrick Valeins, the government's chief scientific adviser, said the actual number of infections in the UK was probably between 5,000 and 10,000. As the UK enters a new phase of its epidemic prevention campaign, the government has said it will no longer test patients with mild symptoms who are required to be quarantined at home, and the new coronavirus test will only be carried out on those who are seriously ill and admitted to hospital.

The UK government has previously published an action plan against the disease, divided into four stages: containment, delay, research and impairment. As the number of infections has risen, the fight against the disease has moved from containment to procrastination, that is, how to slow the spread of the virus in the UK and reduce the impact of reaching peak levels.

Johnson described the new pneumonia as "the worst public health crisis in a generation" , but said the timing of tougher measures was important so no announcement was made about the closure of schools or the end of mass rallies. On the choice of whether to close schools, Johnson said: "The scientific advice is that doing so now would do more harm than good. "

Compared with the policy vigour of other countries, Britain's approach has attracted criticism. The former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, criticised the Johnson Administration for failing to act when the UK was just four weeks away from Italy. Richard Holden, editor-in-chief of the Lancet, the world's leading medical journal, said the government was making a big mistake by "playing roulette" with public health in a country that desperately needs social distancing and closure policies.

But Valeins said the government was now taking steps to ease the peak of the epidemic and help create a herd immunity in the UK. Because most infected people have mild disease, they can develop immunity to a particular group after cure, making more people immune to the new pneumonia, he said. VALEINS estimates that around 60% of the population will not become immunised until the virus is cured, a figure that has been disputed by various interpretations.

Chen Zhengming, a professor of epidemiology at University of Oxford, told Caijing that the government's approach was sometimes callous and rational, but that it took into account the country's circumstances and public psychology. He said more measures are being prepared in the UK, but it is an important consideration for the British government when these measures will be implemented for maximum effect, that, though, makes Britain's approach seem incomprehensible when compared with China's and the rest of Europe's.

"The biggest lesson for Wuhan is that it can't squeeze out medical resources and can't infect doctors, which is very critical, " Chen said.

"The biggest lesson for Wuhan is that it can't squeeze out medical resources and can't infect doctors, which is very critical, " Chen said.

CAIJING: compared with the closure of schools in France and the closure of the whole country in Italy, is the British government's response too dismissive?

Chen Zhengming: officially, it's based on science, but there are already some different voices at the level of scientists. Both the Lancet editor and the former health secretary disagree about the government's actions, saying they have done too little. It was supposed to be something bigger, such as closing schools, restricting or cancelling large gatherings of people such as sporting events, concerts, or having clear rules, such as Germany cancelling under 1,000 events. So Johnson's announcement faces different voices at home.

In my view, the current policy may be more about minimizing the impact on the economy and on people's lives, but these measures will change sooner or later, because the UK epidemic is still in a rapidly rising phase. Now the UK epidemic prevention work has entered the second phase, that is to reduce the damage phase. The first phase is to try to keep the virus out, and in February the UK basically tried to contain the virus by early screening, diagnosing and isolating people who had been exposed to it. Now that there is a large community spread, it may not be enough, and hopefully most people will be able to get through it without a sudden mass run on the health system. It is also reasonable to treat patients according to their severity, as is the case in China and Italy.

It is also reasonable to treat patients according to their severity, as is the case in China and Italy.

CAIJING: one of the British government's strategies is to create a herd immunity against the virus, but is it too risky in the absence of a vaccine?

Chen Zhengming: So the British strategy was too risky and rational, and now Germany is doing the same. It's totally different from the way the east plays, can't hold it off, brings you in. Can this virus be eliminated? It is not the same as SARS, SARS infection after a high fever, high fever after the infection, and finally the virus disappeared. But the new coronavirus is a protracted war, the final elimination of the virus there are two ways, one is the vaccine out as soon as possible, which is promising, but certainly not before the summer. The other is like the Spanish flu, which came in three waves, and then died because there were so many people infected, and everyone became immune. Some people die after infection, others are cured, recover, develop immunity, and the risk of transmission slowly diminishes until it finally dies.

Now the British government is adopting the same idea. At some point, the government should do more, but there may be no way to do what Asia, such as China, has done. China is a big force, cutting the Gordian knot quickly, but the cost is also high. China's measures also came at a particular time, just during the Spring Festival, when everyone was on vacation, and the shutdown had already taken place, so the shutdown continued to control the epidemic. If we were to shut down 1.4 billion people under normal circumstances, I think it would be very difficult to do that. Different countries have different situations, different time points and infection situations, and different starting points. Therefore, there are various ways to deal with the situation, which are suitable for each country, but each has its own advantages and disadvantages. There is no perfect plan.

Chen Zhengming: So the British strategy was too risky and rational, and now Germany is doing the same. It's totally different from the way the east plays, can't hold it off, brings you in. Can this virus be eliminated? It is not the same as SARS, SARS infection after a high fever, high fever after the infection, and finally the virus disappeared. But the new coronavirus is a protracted war, the final elimination of the virus there are two ways, one is the vaccine out as soon as possible, which is promising, but certainly not before the summer. The other is like the Spanish flu, which came in three waves, and then died because there were so many people infected, and everyone became immune. Some people die after infection, others are cured, recover, develop immunity, and the risk of transmission slowly diminishes until it finally dies.

CAIJING: The British government says it made these policies based on science, probability and models, but the new coronavirus is a brand new virus. What if the algorithm isn't accurate enough to make a bad decision?

Chen Zhengming: although it is possible, but now the coefficient of the virus is basically clear. The R0 regeneration coefficient, which is the number of people a person can infect, is about three or four. Previously the transmission coefficient was less than three, and the number of people infected doubled in about six days, but now it has doubled in Britain and Italy in four days. In reality, it could be more serious, with a spread factor of three to four. Based on this curve, it's pretty predictable, so now it's just a matter of delaying. The first is that through propaganda, the people themselves take some action, so as to minimize the damage to the economy, because once the government comes forward, the government will have to pay for a lot of things, and economic policy and political policy are closely related. There are a lot of economic considerations here, and each country has its own situation.

The other is that the UK is bound to take some extreme measures, as Italy did, but it has to assess when they were taken and how well they are tolerated. As China's level of the city certainly can not be closed, the Chinese people have a strong tolerance, cooperation, a big picture. The British people can't do it, so the British government wants to use it at the most critical moment. Such considerations have some merit, but they may also be inaccurate and may underestimate the public's awareness.

Science is not set in stone. There are certainly different voices, and we have heard different opinions. So from the individual point of view, there is no need to listen to the government, according to their own knowledge and judgment, what measures should be taken and what measures should be taken. A lot of people may still be singing and dancing and doing what they're supposed to do, and it may not work out in the end, but it may be a couple of weeks before they start cursing. But others are more vigilant, minimizing face-to-face contact, and doing what you can while trying to live a normal life. It's a sensible and rational thing to do. In fact, the response of the society has become increasingly strong, even if the government does not speak, the people will have their own judgment. Nevertheless, there is no great panic in society. The state should do the state, the community should do the community, and the individual should do the individual. Find a more balanced program.

CAIJING: Johnson's advisers say the UK could be facing the same situation as Italy in four weeks'time, and to what extent can the NHS cope?

Chen Zhengming: the situation in the UK will definitely worsen and spread, but my personal judgment is probably not so bad as to whether it will develop into the situation in Italy. First, the early infection curve shows that Italy started out better than the UK, with almost zero growth, followed by a sudden outbreak, suggesting that containment was not done well enough and that communities had spread undetected. Early steps were also taken in the UK, some of which were brought under control in a timely manner. Although this may still be insufficient compared with Singapore, there was no significant increase at least in February.

Italy seems to be very calm, except for imported cases at the end of January, there has been little since then. Italy was the first country to declare a state of emergency and the first to cut off flights to China, and the last to suffer the most. Because the time point of the policy adopted is not well grasped, or it is well grasped but not strong enough, because it is not like the outbreak in Wuhan, everyone has a false sense of security, feel fine, do what you have to do. Italy held a lot of events in February, Venice carnival, Milan fashion week, the marathon will be held as usual.

This kind of gathering group activity spread very badly, close contact and mutual exchange, become the best place for the virus to spread. The virus began to spread rapidly, and it began to become more likely among young people, who did not have obvious symptoms and were able to carry it off. Slowly spreading to the elderly, the real problem erupts. Italy is the oldest country in Europe and has a huge impact on health care. Another problem in Italy is regional clustering, with Lombardy 见 Lombardia，Reg. Accounting for 60 to 70 per cent of cases. Although this is the richest part of Italy, no amount of medical resources can keep up with the flood of patients. The UK wants the cases to be spread fairly evenly and not have a severe drain on health resources in one place.

I don't think that's going to happen in the UK like it did in Italy. The first is age, the UK's age structure is relatively less ageing, the second is relatively more evenly distributed, and the third is that although infection in the UK is also worsening, the spread of early cases is not as rapid as in Italy, that's a lot of prep time. The outbreak in the UK is likely to develop three to four weeks later than in Italy and hospitals are making the necessary preparations. Now there are two steps. One is to postpone the surgery, which is not life-threatening, but it will cause some secondary medical harm. In addition, patient selection may have to be done as in Italy. Treatment is not by first come, first served, but according to the condition, when breathing machine or extracorporeal pulmonary circulation instrument is not enough, for who to use. It's cruel, but there's no way.

CAIJING: The British government has abandoned testing for all suspected cases of mild illness, but it could also increase the risk of transmission in the community. Is that a wise decision?

Chen Zhengming: The British government's approach is difficult for China to understand. It is determined by its politics, its society, and sometimes its almost callous rational calm. It's based on probability theory, and it expects the public to cooperate if necessary. The UK is a civil society, diagnosing a case in which it is impossible to publish the patient's full course of action, and in the East it is a sign of vigilance that is not possible for the sake of privacy. You don't know where it's happening, which makes it a lot harder to control.

But right now, the policy is to quarantine anyone who shows symptoms, and I think the public will respect that. After two months of awareness of the disease is still very important, television is also promoting a variety of health precautions, wash hands, but did not say to wear a mask. There are objective and subjective reasons, one is the shortage of masks, the other is the spread of viruses through droplets, as long as a certain distance, so the emphasis on hand-washing has its scientific rationale.

"CAIJING" : to give up the test for mild illness because of the lack of detection ability?

Chen Zhengming: I don't think so. It's a British strategy. In fact, more than a dozen testing centres were opened in the UK in February and are now capable of testing between 10,000 and 20,000 a day. The number of detections can reflect the severity of the epidemic, but all to test, the results show that a positive may not go to the hospital, because it depends on the condition. If it's mild, stay at home, because 80% of people are immune to it. Some of them didn't make it to the hospital. This may seem like a callous, rational calmness, but it makes sense, because of the number of infections and the trade-offs that have to be made. Isolated at home, Britain is better off than China, because the population density is lower, the home usually has a few rooms, divided into upstairs and downstairs. But you can't know what's going on without testing.

"CAIJING" : Before Wuhan is also a mild illness at home isolation, but this led to more infections, so later to build a shelter hospital centralized treatment, Wuhan Experience for the United Kingdom without reference?

Chen Zhengming: the biggest reference meaning of Wuhan is not to squeeze medical resources, not to let the doctor infection, this is very critical. Patients who go into the shelter are rarely treated, and most don't need treatment to get out of the hospital. But by setting up a shelter hospital, unnecessary community transmission was reduced. Does the UK need it? We may not need it just yet. One is that the UK is not quite there yet. The other is that the UK may not need to do so because of its low community density and better living conditions. In the UK, the emphasis is on home quarantine, family must be isolated, in the hope that there will not be too many families gathered cross-infection. There will be, but the extent of the damage is unclear.

CAIJING: Is it useful to wear a mask to prevent new coronary pneumonia? Why are the UK and China drawing different conclusions?

Chen Zhengming: The culture in Britain and Europe is to wear a mask when you are sick. Chinese who wear masks are beaten or discriminated against, sometimes because they think you are sick and run around outside, leading to misunderstanding and conflict. But as the epidemic expands, so will it. Especially in densely populated areas, some people are now wearing masks.

CAIJING: Do you wear a mask?

Chen Zhengming: I didn't wear it. First, the number of people infected in Britain is still small, the proportion is still small, and scattered in different places. Second, personal protection. It doesn't make much sense to wear a mask now, because the UK population density is not very high. Droplet spread is usually only one or two meters away, the most critical is to wash your hands. A lot of research has been done before, with bird flu and previous flu, and it turns out that wearing a mask and not washing your hands doesn't stop the virus from spreading. People who wear masks incorrectly or don't replace them, or don't wash their hands after wearing them, can increase the risk of infection.

Another problem is that masks are hard to find now. Although you have a mask, you should use it when you need it. Now try to keep your social distance and your contact to a minimum. Everyone's on their toes, but to a certain extent, it still works.

CAIJING: Are the four stages of containment, delay, research, and impairment the usual model for dealing with infectious disease outbreaks in the UK?

Chen Zhengming: not exactly. The UK will certainly have some policies in place, especially in the face of a pandemic, but they will first have to be based on the epidemiological characteristics of the epidemic, its hazards and its mode of transmission. In the past, mad cow disease spread through different routes, and in the worst case scenario, a million people might get infected, but they didn't. This time it's probably 70 to 80 percent, 500,000 people are going to die, and that's the worst case scenario, and I don't think it's going to be that bad. But the worst case scenario, and then see what happens at each stage, how to deal with, according to national strength, to find the benefits of maximum, minimize the harm of the response, Britain can not do as China does without cost. China's national conditions are different, China is an all-powerful government, the people are relatively co-operative, the outbreak is relatively concentrated in Wuhan.

Britain's four-phase action plan is based on the epidemic, now into the second phase, but the second phase is not set in stone, measures will be phased out. Research is interspersed at all stages, not only in the UK, but also with international experience. The main reason for the delay now is that the impact on the UK health system has not been felt particularly badly. But looking back two weeks from now, the pressure on the NHS may be different, but try to hope for a soft landing, not a hard one, leading to a collapse of the health system, as is the case in Italy.

The second phase of the policy will be divided into three levels. It is still at the primary level. Although it has already entered the delayed stage, the policies it has put in place are still only a little bit superficial. Drastic measures have not yet been put in place, such as suspension from school, suspension from the market, suspension from work, etc. , or shut down the city. It's all possible, it's all planned, it's all on the line. But it's hard to say when. France is a bit more serious than the UK, a week or two ahead of the UK in terms of prevalence. There are social psychology considerations, France to this time, we are afraid, a shot we are easy to accept. But Britain is not there yet. If you cry wolf now, no one will believe you when the real wolf comes. This is a very important starting point. Wuhan and Italy are always so far away that most people don't realize how serious they are.

But in a week, if the epidemic continues to worsen and now doubles every four days, the next step may be to consider cancelling some major events, such as sporting events and concerts. If the government now announced the cancellation of public activities, it is bound to have a refund, refund on the business impact is very large. But oneself does not go is own matter, the loss bears by oneself. So the current measures are to minimize social and economic shocks. Next may be suspended, closed, and finally to see whether or not to close the city. I expect there will be these different stages, and I hope it doesn't come to this. But Fengcheng is also a nominal city, the Italian city and the degree of the city of Wuhan is not the same.

CAIJING: The British government has introduced a panel of behavioral psychologists into its decision making, which relies heavily on models that predict people's behavior, and the resulting policy response is quite different from that of other countries. How do you see the role of this group?

Chen Zhengming: There are pros and cons to many things. Sometimes it may be a bit dogmatic, but it can not be completely ignored. The closure of the city in Italy, for example, seemed like a good response, but the children were suspended from school, who would take care of them? Although close contact with the school has been reduced, some of these children come home and need to be taken care of by the elderly, thus increasing the risk of transmission from the child to the elderly. If need parents to take care of, parents is a doctor how to do, medical resources are already very tight. Another consideration is how long the lockdown will last. China has reached the limit. If it goes on, everyone will go crazy. In Britain and Italy, the situation is different. Once it is over, they all go on holiday, which increases the chances of population movement and infection. It's a tricky question, but many are not so simple and have two sides.

Estimates of people's tolerance are based on previous studies, and at particular times, people's tolerance may be different. But a two-month British blockade is out of the question. Two or three weeks may be the limit, but when will those three weeks be used? Wait until the peak time, we are prepared, also accepted. This may not be an acceptable time, but if we take an effective action when the time comes, everyone will cooperate. There's some science to this, but it seems a little too rational and calm, but there's no way, like in war, there's always a trade-off.

CAIJING: But from the Chinese point of view, it's still a little hard to understand.

Chen Zhengming: It is more difficult to understand. China does have a lot to learn from, but it can not and can not do the same in a different context. China is an all-powerful government, and the people are co-operating and in step. This is a civil society, must interact, so the introduction of policy needs to balance all aspects of the factors. Unless there is an extreme state of emergency, then it is natural to adopt policies, but now is not the time.

So many people in China don't quite understand. After the outbreak, we can also discuss, different social management model, pros and cons, is very complex. Some people say that China's epidemic prevention is biology plus political science, which should take into account many political and biological factors. China is hoping for a war of annihilation, complete eradication of the virus. The West, such as Britain and Germany, is "dancing with the disease" and fighting a protracted war.

CAIJING: What can the British government do now to strengthen its response capacity?

Chen Zhengming: the Policy Angle has entered the second stage of epidemic prevention. It may be two or three months before we can make a scientific assessment of whether current policies are right or wrong. The government has its reasons, but some people have different opinions. It is hard to say whether it is the most reasonable until the epidemic has passed. The same is true of different modes of epidemic prevention. China runs the 100-meter dash across the line, but new papers are handed out. The UK sees it as a marathon, with a slow jog and no rush to finish, so it's too early to do anything about it. All we can do is protect ourselves.

A 'roulette wheel' of 40M INFECTIONS FOR HERD IMMUNITY IN THE UK?
It will be very difficult to implement the strategy of delaying the outbreak until the summer, easing the pressure on hospital beds to rotate, and then controlling the outbreak in the process, in the face of the surge in the number of infections.

Failure in epidemic prevention and control: Li Wenliang's hospital falls into rigid compliance with orders
Wuhan's Central Hospital, where he died, was the first to collapse in the outbreak, with the worst casualties. The airline industry's "Hein's law" of flight safety, which also applies to infectious disease control, should be examined in every detail.

Hong Kong draws lessons from SARS, new crown anti-epidemic medical staff zero infection
The medical and health authorities and researchers started early and informed the public as soon as possible. At the same time, they learned from the experience during the SARS epidemic, and paid particular attention to nosocomial infections, this is the Hong Kong SAR of China to fight the new Crown Epidemic is commendable.

Internet "WAR EPIDEMIC" : The most tense week in Wuhan, a sudden increase in health care payment through the last link
Affected by the epidemic, many medical insurance rapid opening of Internet medical payment business, but this may be far from the spring of the industry, the long-term "share of health insurance" is still a bottleneck, to find other buyers are also exploring the period.

The number of mutations in the new coronavirus has increased to 149, and experts say it has not changed much recently
The director-general of WHO said that the transmission of NCP was less efficient than influenza and did not appear to be driven by people who did not have the disease. This means that the outbreak it causes can be contained. But the recent global spread of the epidemic, people from all walks of life remain deeply concerned.

Head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention: It is very difficult to avoid a global pandemic, and the response is imminent

In terms of trends, a new global pandemic of pneumonia may be inevitable, and China will need to do its part to deal with the new risks posed by the global epidemic while fighting its own internal interdiction.
The first autopsy report of a deceased patient with NCP was published to improve the clinical diagnosis and treatment of the patient
The autopsy of 11 patients with NCP has been completed. According to the first report, the presence of mucilage in the deep part of the lung is helpful for the decision-making of sputum-resolving and sputum-expelling schemes in clinical treatment.
After the "effective medicine" came the "new Crown Vaccine" , word play or Rub hot?
The screening of drugs and vaccines, a much-anticipated event, also requires accurate information to reduce public misunderstanding.

28 days after the 730 million-dollar direct online reporting system for infectious diseases failed
After January 24,2020, the Infectious Disease Network direct report system is very important to report and summarize the information of epidemic situation in different places, and to prevent and control the epidemic situation as a whole, but still needs to further improve the reporting mechanism, the monitoring system is too complicated and so on.
From the cold bench to the spotlight, chloroquine and other "chicken ribs" medicine into the new scheme of diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia
ABIDOL and chloroquine phosphate are still needed to be tested in clinical trials for the treatment of new coronary pneumonia. Clinical trials of the drugs should continue even after the outbreak is over, to prevent a relapse.
Who was the first person to be genetically tested for new coronavirus pneumonia?
After the first "unclassified coronavirus" was detected by a third-party testing agency, the hospital was informed only by telephone. Three days later, the second case report read "SARS coronavirus. ". No one thought at the time that it was a COVID-19 attack.
Two new cases of coronary pneumonia with pathology results are available, and the autopsy is still under way
Researchers are trying to reveal the pathogenicity and lethality of the new coronavirus and provide new evidence for clinical treatment. The phase result is that the pathogenicity of the new coronavirus is similar to SARS, and the further result may be revealed by dissection.

Analysis of 70,000 new coronary disease cases: crude case-fatality rate 2.3% 
So far, there is no evidence of a superspreader event like the SARS outbreak, but the exact cause of the infection and the failure to prevent remains to be investigated.
From the lab to the ward, stop the new coronavirus
The tracing of the virus, the route of transmission from animal to human, and the mode of transmission from human to human are still in progress, and the development and validation of anti-viral vaccines and specific drugs are just beginning.
Doctors and nurses in Hubei face the toughest month as infections mount
Unknown to the virus, lack of medical supplies, but also because of high-intensity work pressure to affect immunity, leading to the peak of medical infection. With the enhancement of the awareness and knowledge of virus, the relative protective measures are put in place, fewer and fewer medical staff should be infected in the later period.
NCP NUCLEIC ACID detection "missed diagnosis" : sampling is not standardized, the quality of kits vary
The low positive rate of nucleic acid test in NCP was related to the development stage of NCP, the standardization of collection process and the quality of the Kit. In order to reduce the possibility of "missed diagnosis" , experts suggest that different manufacturers of reagent boxes for systematic comparison.

A 'roulette wheel' of 40M INFECTIONS FOR HERD IMMUNITY IN THE UK?

It will be very difficult to implement the strategy of delaying the outbreak until the summer, easing the pressure on hospital beds to rotate, and then controlling the outbreak in the process, in the face of the surge in the number of infections.

Failure in epidemic prevention and control: Li Wenliang's hospital falls into rigid compliance with orders

Wuhan's Central Hospital, where he died, was the first to collapse in the outbreak, with the worst casualties. The airline industry's "Hein's law" of flight safety, which also applies to infectious disease control, should be examined in every detail.

Hong Kong draws lessons from SARS, new crown anti-epidemic medical staff zero infection

The medical and health authorities and researchers started early and informed the public as soon as possible. At the same time, they learned from the experience during the SARS epidemic, and paid particular attention to nosocomial infections, this is the Hong Kong SAR of China to fight the new Crown Epidemic is commendable.

Internet "WAR EPIDEMIC" : The most tense week in Wuhan, a sudden increase in health care payment through the last link

Affected by the epidemic, many medical insurance rapid opening of Internet medical payment business, but this may be far from the spring of the industry, the long-term "share of health insurance" is still a bottleneck, to find other buyers are also exploring the period.

The number of mutations in the new coronavirus has increased to 149, and experts say it has not changed much recently

The director-general of WHO said that the transmission of NCP was less efficient than influenza and did not appear to be driven by people who did not have the disease. This means that the outbreak it causes can be contained. But the recent global spread of the epidemic, people from all walks of life remain deeply concerned.

Head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention: It is very difficult to avoid a global pandemic, and the response is imminent

In terms of trends, a new global pandemic of pneumonia may be inevitable, and China will need to do its part to deal with the new risks posed by the global epidemic while fighting its own internal interdiction.

The first autopsy report of a deceased patient with NCP was published to improve the clinical diagnosis and treatment of the patient

The autopsy of 11 patients with NCP has been completed. According to the first report, the presence of mucilage in the deep part of the lung is helpful for the decision-making of sputum-resolving and sputum-expelling schemes in clinical treatment.

After the "effective medicine" came the "new Crown Vaccine" , word play or Rub hot?

The screening of drugs and vaccines, a much-anticipated event, also requires accurate information to reduce public misunderstanding.

28 days after the 730 million-dollar direct online reporting system for infectious diseases failed

After January 24,2020, the Infectious Disease Network direct report system is very important to report and summarize the information of epidemic situation in different places, and to prevent and control the epidemic situation as a whole, but still needs to further improve the reporting mechanism, the monitoring system is too complicated and so on.

From the cold bench to the spotlight, chloroquine and other "chicken ribs" medicine into the new scheme of diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia

ABIDOL and chloroquine phosphate are still needed to be tested in clinical trials for the treatment of new coronary pneumonia. Clinical trials of the drugs should continue even after the outbreak is over, to prevent a relapse.

Who was the first person to be genetically tested for new coronavirus pneumonia?

After the first "unclassified coronavirus" was detected by a third-party testing agency, the hospital was informed only by telephone. Three days later, the second case report read "SARS coronavirus. ". No one thought at the time that it was a COVID-19 attack.
