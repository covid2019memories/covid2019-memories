I was really extremely lucky, after the Mac broke down, the old computer network card several years ago also broke down, even could not connect the home Wi-fi, became a stand-alone machine, and told colleagues that all the computers I could find were broken, it was very difficult to work from home, it felt like people didn't believe it, and the timing was too coincidental, writing this diary has started typing mobile phones, every day and there is no tomorrow of the original life.

Back to work follow-up: According to the request, the unit starts to provide the relevant proof, the office handles collectively, after the submission material temporarily has not the following, the temporary notice is not urgent to go to the organ, is on standby at home. Project colleagues ran to the company early in the morning, the property block, said the unit can only enter two people a day, hurried to the suburbs, breakfast too late, but had a big wall.

The other project's co-workers were even more miserable. The canteen chef, a native of Hubei Province, was trapped in his hometown, unable to get out without food. He could overcome a row of small fried food downstairs. However, the centralized isolation hotel required by the district was located just below their company (the top floor of a hotel they had rented) , this everybody dare not go over, change temporarily at home telecommute, have matter wechat telephone.

Listen to the impossible while walking. The latest issue is called "the end of happiness. " The title comes from a song by Hins Cheung called no more: I don't believe in the future, I don't want to see history, it's ironic to live, so don't do anything stupid, let the pain come back a thousand times, show how much fun there is.

The lyrics sound appropriate, the program has nothing to do with the epidemic, is baoting's own thoughts, roughly people's impression of negative, painful, than positive, happy deep, we bear in mind the criticism, to other people's negative evaluation, but little memory of praise and approval. To put it bluntly, we are a bit "cheap" , like to listen to criticism, not used to receiving awards, over time, we become only get criticized to progress. Her recommendations for reading Praise is fleeting, but brickbats we recall and Bad is stronger than good make it clear that a preference for criticism is in our genes because it keeps US alert and better prepared for danger and unexpected situations, survival requires anticipation and preparation for a bad outcome, rather than focusing on the good things to celebrate; there is also an explanation that we subconsciously perceive as being critical, and that negative speakers are more rational and intelligent, are also inclined to accept their suggestions (criticisms) .

The funny thing is, it's hard to take criticism and not take different voices these days, Fang Fang wrote in her diary, sincere and helpless in the face of strict censorship, she couldn't do anything about it, she wrote it in the dumbest way possible, now most programs directly grasp the content, the teacher's efforts may be difficult to be seen by real people: Dear network managers, some words, you still have to let the Wuhan people say. It'll make you feel better. We have been sealed here for more than 10 days, see so many inhumanity, if not even vent a pain, even a few complaints or a little reflection are not allowed, really want to make everyone crazy?

Today I read the Dictum of Li Xiuwen, chairman of Hubei Writers Association: You know that fear is also layered. The fear of the previous day is not the same as the fear of today. To be honest, I didn't feel much fear the other day, but now I can clearly feel everyone's fear rising because no one knows where it will end! I personally resent the "Give Wuhan back to US" slogans in my circle of friends, which ignore the specific circumstances of each individual. A lot of writers are writing about the current disaster, but I can't, and if I did, I'd like to be more calm and rational. The only ethics of disaster literature is to reflect on disaster.

Li Xiuwen said that he can not start writing at the moment because he can not calm down. I think for everyone in Wuhan, for those who are closely following the pneumonia epidemic, most people have this kind of mood. These days, I can barely get into a calm state only when I read a book, the rest of the time is spent in a kind of "boiling water" inflammable and explosive, and "endless falling" sad depression.

Wuhan in the early morning and issued a new notice not to let out the community, our community, as always, let people angry, nothing, do not organize shopping, also do not care about the investigation. I'M NOT GONNA complain about how the numbers were calculated at the press conference, because a lot of communities didn't do it. Grass-roots personnel are also suffering. They are very tired, they can not rest for several days, they are exposed to an environment that is prone to infection, and they are on the verge of emotional collapse. Everyone is hanging on by their fingernails. In recent days, more and more news of death from overwork has come out, and they are tired to death at work, i have never felt worthy of publicity and encouragement, but feel ashamed, people as a machine, out of battery charging, is it possible.

I could swear no more, for I never knew what absurd measures I could contrive the next day, and I laughed at myself for feeling my chest more often these days for lumps. Shouting slogans loudly, never responsible for the upper, implementation and implementation of the pressure piled on the grass-roots level, and the patient and stuck in the middle, waiting, wasting, kicking the ball to mention, do not feel that this is human life. We must be apprehensive and cautious , perhaps the provinces are getting better and better under control, but not in Wuhan, where the elderly are left without treatment and desperate jumpers and relatives are sent to isolation points without care, there is no shortage of human tragedies in the city.

I watched a few videos of the collapse, very sad, the staff almost shouted into the microphone, CCTV interview, the staff hungry, eyes are tired, mental state visible to the naked eye, still have to answer questions, the reporter has been guiding him to say Nice, honest staff continue to talk to themselves, finally to the face of the said a "good little bit. ".

Every day can see xx very nervous request for help, before is Wuhan lacks, becomes Hubei lacks, now the whole country lacks, perhaps really has a black hole which fills. As mentioned in the last article, what do you want to do after the epidemic is over? As expected, there is a discussion on whether or not it will drive consumption. At least, it will be difficult to open a wave of retaliatory buying and buying. For the people in Wuhan (like me) , a disaster made me realize what is more important, or what I really need, if I'm going to be able to deal with a crisis like this again; for everyone else, it's perfectly OK not to go out for a month, just buy food and groceries, don't order takeout, don't eat out, don't shop, don't wear makeup, don't shop online, as the days went on, the whole turbulent environment of advocating consumption changed. Everyone's focus shifted, and their mentality changed. Their endogenous desire cooled down. How could the outside world create festivals and Discount Promotions to tempt everyone to consume, it is believed that fewer people will rush to buy a single code.

Looking at the epidemic prevention documents issued in some areas, the requirements for people who come from outside to rework are very strict. It is almost as if you are not welcome at the moment. For example, you must have a suite, and you see the truck driver who is forced to drift on the highway, the workers involved in the construction of the Vulcan Mountain Hospital were considered to be the god of plague when they returned to their hometowns. The Hubei people who were chased all over the country drifted all the way, unable to return to Hubei or their local residences.

The pneumonia dissimilates to a certain area's person, we to pneumonia's fear, the exclusion vent on the human body, Hubei / Wuhan identity has become the pneumonia's scapegoat. There are also some current practices in the province that are chilling. I am very ashamed. I am as disappointed and resentful as other local compatriots. I am also sorry for the friends from all over the country who have helped Hubei and supported Hubei. Wind, fire and fire have helped us, as a result, most people in Hubei are lovely and kind, don't be disappointed in the whole group.

Finally, I still want to say that this is an extraordinary time, an abnormal state of affairs. There are references on the Internet to "refuse to normalize exceptions" , to be vigilant and not to allow exceptions to slowly become the norm and to expand unchecked. For example, in Singapore and Japan, the number of cases is increasing, and some people are starting to complain again. Before, they laughed at others for making a big deal out of nothing, and now they say that the epidemic prevention is not in place. In fact, people are all following standard practice and taking appropriate measures according to the situation of epidemic spread, in addition to their high efficiency, the average patient has sufficient medical resources, can be said to be well prepared, why there is ridicule, think we are more hard core, more like doing big things, because we project the current abnormal state to other countries, it's really hard for someone else to do what we do when we think of extraordinary times as normal, when we think of extraordinary times as normal, when we think of extraordinary times as abnormal, when we think of ourselves as layers of patches.

The original request was 214 back to work, see how far it goes, hang on.

2020.2.11

I was really extremely lucky, after the Mac broke down, the old computer network card several years ago also broke down, even could not connect the home Wi-fi, became a stand-alone machine, and told colleagues that all the computers I could find were broken, it was very difficult to work from home, it felt like people didn't believe it, and the timing was too coincidental, writing this diary has started typing mobile phones, every day and there is no tomorrow of the original life.

Back to work follow-up: According to the request, the unit starts to provide the relevant proof, the office handles collectively, after the submission material temporarily has not the following, the temporary notice is not urgent to go to the organ, is on standby at home. Project colleagues ran to the company early in the morning, the property block, said the unit can only enter two people a day, hurried to the suburbs, breakfast too late, but had a big wall.

The other project's co-workers were even more miserable. The canteen chef, a native of Hubei Province, was trapped in his hometown, unable to get out without food. He could overcome a row of small fried food downstairs. However, the centralized isolation hotel required by the district was located just below their company (the top floor of a hotel they had rented) , this everybody dare not go over, change temporarily at home telecommute, have matter wechat telephone.

Listen to the impossible while walking. The latest issue is called "the end of happiness. " The title comes from a song by Hins Cheung called no more: I don't believe in the future, I don't want to see history, it's ironic to live, so don't do anything stupid, let the pain come back a thousand times, show how much fun there is.

The lyrics sound appropriate, the program has nothing to do with the epidemic, is baoting's own thoughts, roughly people's impression of negative, painful, than positive, happy deep, we bear in mind the criticism, to other people's negative evaluation, but little memory of praise and approval. To put it bluntly, we are a bit "cheap" , like to listen to criticism, not used to receiving awards, over time, we become only get criticized to progress.
