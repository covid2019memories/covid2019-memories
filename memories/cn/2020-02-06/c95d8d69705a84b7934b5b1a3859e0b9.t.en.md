Features, Lanxi, founder of zhulu.com  , focuses on in-depth observations and business reviews of Internet startups, new media, and subcultures.

In my diary the next day, I spoke of my doubts about the direction of Home Quarantine for people with mild illness, and many people argued in the comments that during the special period of hospital overcrowding, it was an understandable and necessary decision.

Until more than a week later, when Zhong Nanshan said home quarantine was dangerous because it would deprive the government of its ability to monitor and control the source of the infection, there's no way to know if he's really been able to stay at home with no one, and if he doesn't follow through, the added risk is in a public health blind spot.

So Wuhan began a high-profile forced isolation, commandeering universities, convention and exhibition centers and private hotels, trying to get all patients in anyway, cut off every potential source of infection.

I bring it up now, not as a matter of right and wrong, but as an expression of dissatisfaction: Even I, a fundamental layman, know that it is possible, in the most basic sense of logic, to assume that if there were no verification mechanism, to let people isolate themselves is to let the epidemic go unchecked. Why didn't Wuhan realize that this was a problem?

Yes, medical resources are not enough. We can not ask for "horses to run and not to eat grass" . But what is even more unacceptable is that the cart before the Horse is turned? Is the goal to stop the epidemic at all costs, or to reduce the burden of hospital visits?

In response, the whole city began door-to-door temperature measurements (as well as self-examination) . A three-level quarantine system was introduced. The government and our departments issued military orders to themselves, which were carried out with a stern attitude of never missing a single person, it seemed to me that this was the first week or even the first three days of the lock up -- as if it wasn't worth waiting for the experts in Beijing to figure out what was wrong and then hurrying to fix it, does that mean we're still doing what we were doing?

Government is used to solve problems. When the people ask the government to solve problems, the government's answer should never include "I'm too south" , "you can do it" , "what to do" , "shut the fuck up" .

So, with the right kind of concentration, new questions arise one after another: In a shelter-free hospital, could chase cause cross-infection? For example, Tianmen is a city with limited financial resources. The environment in some places is very bad. Can we try to improve it?

In Times of crisis, I will say straight out, the problem can not be solved well, is in the disregard of human life, history will engrave the suffering of sentient beings, as well as those responsible for escape.

Yang Gonghuan, a retired deputy director of the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention, was asked how she, a front-line official who had experienced SARS, viewed the new outbreak.

According to Yang Gonghuan:

"The biggest lesson we learned during SARS was to be transparent and to let people know. The truth is a very, very important part of dealing with a big public health issue, and it's a very, very important part, and I can't stress enough that I want you to remember that at all times. "

It has been proven 17 years ago that epidemics can not afford to hide, that viruses are apolitical and inhumane, that they don't care how much you suffer, that the more you refuse to be right and true, the closer you are to playing with fire in a wine cellar, and that no one is safe from an explosion.

The so-called "inflection point" will not fall from the sky, never forget, things in man-made, often become.
