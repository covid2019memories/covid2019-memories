In 2020, Kimiaki's biggest regret was cutting down an acre of big cherry trees and building two strawberry greenhouses last year.
Big Cherry is Shandong Luzhong area "Earth said" , in fact, is the domestic car Li. Our Village Has Been Growing Large Cherries for more than 10 years, the most expensive time, can be sold for 15,6 yuan a catty, an mu of land can have more than 20,000 yuan income.
In 2017 and 2018, during the two-year Qingming Festival, the central region of Shandong was hit by a "late spring cold" , which caused more than half of the cherry blossoms to freeze off during the blooming season. When the harvest came, the price of the Cherries did not go up, and Wang Mingfa earned just over 8,000 yuan a year.
He calculated a sum of money, excluding fertilizer, pesticides, labor and other costs, this year, is "wasted. ".
He did not go to school for a few days, could not say "industrial upgrading and transformation" , but recognized a truth: If he continued to plant it, it would be a dead end, as if it was a competition, with every family growing the same kind of crop, source but only a few foreign merchants, it is easy to be underpriced; Second, the production cycle of Big Cherry, flowering, pollination, fruit drop process often encounter accidents, to put it bluntly, is "rely on the day to eat. ".
In 2019, after visiting several nearby towns and villages, Wang decided to replace the crops in his field with strawberries in a greenhouse with better prospects.
Strawberry production cycle is short, high yield, the lunar August planting, about three months can be harvested. The fresh fruit of winter village is little, visit relatives and friends, at home treat guests strawberry is rare. According to the market prices in past years, during the Spring Festival, a catty of strawberries can be sold for about 20 yuan.
If the profits are high, so is the investment. Greenhouse greenhouse construction needs glass film and Professional PC board, a need to invest more than 40,000. To this end, Wang Mingfa to the bank loans of 30,000 yuan.

Because the material is expensive, the greenhouse greenhouse construction cost is quite high, one needs 40,000 yuan
To ensure a high yield of strawberries, you have to use good seedlings. Wang made a special trip to the provincial capital of Jinan, where he hired a car to run more than 200 kilometers and brought back fifteen thousand good seedlings, costing more than 9,000 yuan. Want strawberry size is big, fertilizer is also key, Wang Mingfa is using the Japanese technology of "good Kenchong fertilization" , an acre of land to more than three thousand.

The cost of fertilizer for an Acre of strawberries is about three thousand yuan

As expected, the strawberries turned out to be a lovely crop, red and big at the top. Wang Mingfa calculates, a strawberry whole cycle can produce about two Jin, fifteen thousand is 30,000 Jin. It'll pay for itself in less than two years.
Unexpectedly, strawberry red, the outbreak came.

Two

Epidemic has come, my county each village entrance, have set up duty Sentry Post, forbid outside village personnel to enter. Wang MINGFA's strawberries are out of stock.

My County Spontaneous "village closure" movement is late, the second day of the Lunar New Year began. At first Wang Mingfa did not think that, thinking but "is a form" , then what is not a visit relatives and friends of the? On the third day of the Lunar New Year, when he tried to visit his uncle in a neighboring village, he realized the seriousness of the problem, he had to backtrack with a box of strawberries and two boxes of milk.
By the fourth day, the fifth day, the road is basically no vehicles, no one disappeared. Our village is a big village with several hundred people. Every day, the people of this village can more or less come to Wang mingfa place to spend three or five catties. The rest, he calls and Wechat, contacts in the outer village. If who has the demand, he rides the electric bicycle to the village entrance, "the hand-over intelligence" similarly passes through a sentry to hand over the goods.

There are few people and cars on the country road after "closing the village" 

Wang MINGFA's strawberries, sold from the bottom of the 11th month, were 18 or 9 yuan a catty years ago. These days, in order to promote sales, he first reduced the price to ten yuan, then to eight yuan. At this rate, 30,000 kilos of strawberries will cost at least 30,000 yuan less.
Even so, the take-out business is almost done.
On the afternoon of February 4, Wang Mingfa took five Jin of strawberries to Baihuayu village to deliver goods. At the bridge head of Baihuayu, he saw a married girl from this village come back to his mother's house. Because he was not allowed to enter the village, he and the on-duty staff made a scene. Finally, the village leader called the police. The moment the police car roared in, Wang Mingfa picked up the strawberry and turned around. "You can't even stay at your parents' house? Let alone sell strawberries? " He quipped.
But in the eyes of rival Chen Meiqing, Wang Mingfa has been considered lucky.
Chen Meiqing home has a plastic greenhouse, and Wang mingfa separated by less than a kilometer, due to poor management, strawberry size to small, low yield. To her continuing regret, since twenty-six, she and her family have all caught the flu and have not sold a single strawberry in the village clinic.
"It happened to be the most expensive two days sick. The second day of the New Year, it became ten dollars. " Chen Meiqing everyone will nag. She has sold a shelf of strawberries for less than five thousand dollars since years ago.
More fatally, Wang and Chen also have a common "enemy" , Li Hualun, the village's biggest grower. Li has four strawberry greenhouses, unlike the two that built them into his own fields. Instead, he has contracted ten acres of land along the village road to create a picking garden next to a small restaurant and parking space. These three families are the only strawberry growers in several nearby villages, forming a competitive pattern.
According to say Li Hualun loss is bigger, but 10 yuan a catty price reduction tide is he first opened, 8 yuan is also his leader. In addition, he also donated 500 catties to the town government and 100 catties to the members of the epidemic prevention and control team in each village. Received a commendation certificate.

After the sale failed, Li donated five thousand yuan worth of strawberries to the town government

To this end, Wang Mingfa and Chen Meiqing Find Li Hua ethics. Li Hualun hands, advised them to be clear. "I have my own way of doing business, and I cut my prices to protect my clients. Now, in this case, I have to give it away, at least for a change, " Li said.

Wang Mingfa, who knew how to live, didn't give up either.
In recent days, every day he and his wife squatting in the greenhouse busy, see ripe and there are signs of decay strawberry will pick down, eat first for respect.
Wang MINGFA's family has had enough of strawberries this year

The 17-year-old son, who was attending a vocational and technical school in the county seat, became the object of the couple's anger. "usually the banana, the orange spends the money to buy to eat, exchanged for own fruit not to eat? " Wang Mingfa one day must nag at son three or four times. And force him to eat strawberries.
Wang MINGFA's wife cooked the UNEATEN strawberries with Rock Candy, put them in a glass jar and stored them in the yard. And expect to eat it out of a can when it's warm.
Remembering the bitter and sweet is Wang Mingfa's favorite thing to do. Wang Mingfa, 54, has lived in a mountain village in the south of central Shandong Province, my hometown, since birth. The village is a hilly area with poor land and low wheat and corn yields. Wang Mingfa, who has four brothers and sisters at home, spent hours eating wild vegetables and sorghum.
The word "poor" can be colored by the way he tells it. He told me, even after the reform and opening up is still poor, an mu of land can receive more than 500 Jin of wheat, less than 1,000 yuan. When he was poor, there was not enough dough to eat, and he could not bear to stir-fry vegetables in oil. He tried to roll the steamed bread into a pancake and eat the two staple foods together. "At least it would be soft to bite. ".
One of the strangest stories is that he was so poor that he drank from grasshoppers caught in the mountains. He was drinking, and the power went out, and the grasshopper fell under the leg of the table, and he picked it up and went on smacking. Wait for a call to see, touch up is an earthworm.
To fight poverty, Wang planted a vegetable garden, which he turned into a vineyard in 1997, then an apple orchard, in The Cherry Orchard, and now a strawberry greenhouse. The income is getting better and better, when planting grapes can have two or three thousand per mu, apple tens of thousands, Cherry up to 20 or 30,000.
Kimiaki had a son and a daughter. With an income of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan from the fields, and with the local vendors buying apples every autumn, Wang MINGFA's wife would go with him to work as a part-time labourer in charge of apple packaging, earning between seven and eight thousand yuan. That's enough for a rural family for a year.
The investment of nearly 100,000 yuan to build two strawberry greenhouses is the biggest bet Wang Mingfa has ever made in his life. He said he had to "gamble" that his son would be old enough to start a family in five or six years and that the price of a house in the county seat would be eight thousand per cent earlier.
At present, "gambling" lost Wang mingfa sometimes bemoaned, sometimes optimistic. He saw the outbreak as a natural disaster akin to hail and torrential rain, which he had experienced many times in previous years and had long since come to terms with. Get over it. That's what he's been saying lately.

Pork prices went up last year, and his family hasn't had sausage since Chinese New Year. "It's good to eat chicken. What's not to overcome? " He said. In addition, he also felicitates, oneself is a small business. On TV and on the Internet, he's seen really big people, pouring hundreds of pounds of fruit into the ground. "That's real bad luck. You got ta get over it. "
Voice just fell, he again for the bank interest meat ache, "a year fast three thousand! "
More often, he also because the people in the same village "angry in the heart. ".
Someone from the village would come to his shed and say, shame on him. But the sympathy of the country people will soon return to reality.
When Wang Mingfa finished feeling sorry for him, the villagers would always say, "fortunately, it's not the time to Lay Cherries (May in the Gregorian calendar) . If we catch up with the epidemic at that time, the Cherries will certainly not be sold. " Then they turned to worry about the fruit trees in their fields, be Grateful for yourself.
Angry Wang Mingfa in recent days from the big tile-roofed house, moved into the strawberry shed next to the Orchard House. Because it is greenhouse greenhouse, strawberry shed is more than 20 degrees, move a Mazza to sit inside to eat and drink, is very comfortable. Compared with the northern countryside often below zero indoor, to "enjoy a lot. ".
"although strawberry can not sell out, I at least also moved into the heating room. " Wang Mingfa self-mockery way.
All of the above names are pseudonyms

Wang Mingfa, who knew how to live, didn't give up either.

In recent days, every day he and his wife squatting in the greenhouse busy, see ripe and there are signs of decay strawberry will pick down, eat first for respect.

Wang MINGFA's family has had enough of strawberries this year

The 17-year-old son, who was attending a vocational and technical school in the county seat, became the object of the couple's anger. "usually the banana, the orange spends the money to buy to eat, exchanged for own fruit not to eat? " Wang Mingfa one day must nag at son three or four times. And force him to eat strawberries.

Wang MINGFA's wife cooked the UNEATEN strawberries with Rock Candy, put them in a glass jar and stored them in the yard. And expect to eat it out of a can when it's warm.

Remembering the bitter and sweet is Wang Mingfa's favorite thing to do. Wang Mingfa, 54, has lived in a mountain village in the south of central Shandong Province, my hometown, since birth. The village is a hilly area with poor land and low wheat and corn yields. Wang Mingfa, who has four brothers and sisters at home, spent hours eating wild vegetables and sorghum.

The word "poor" can be colored by the way he tells it. He told me, even after the reform and opening up is still poor, an mu of land can receive more than 500 Jin of wheat, less than 1,000 yuan. When he was poor, there was not enough dough to eat, and he could not bear to stir-fry vegetables in oil. He tried to roll the steamed bread into a pancake and eat the two staple foods together. "At least it would be soft to bite. ".

One of the strangest stories is that he was so poor that he drank from grasshoppers caught in the mountains. He was drinking, and the power went out, and the grasshopper fell under the leg of the table, and he picked it up and went on smacking. Wait for a call to see, touch up is an earthworm.

To fight poverty, Wang planted a vegetable garden, which he turned into a vineyard in 1997, then an apple orchard, in The Cherry Orchard, and now a strawberry greenhouse. The income is getting better and better, when planting grapes can have two or three thousand per mu, apple tens of thousands, Cherry up to 20 or 30,000.

Kimiaki had a son and a daughter. With an income of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan from the fields, and with the local vendors buying apples every autumn, Wang MINGFA's wife would go with him to work as a part-time labourer in charge of apple packaging, earning between seven and eight thousand yuan. That's enough for a rural family for a year.

The investment of nearly 100,000 yuan to build two strawberry greenhouses is the biggest bet Wang Mingfa has ever made in his life. He said he had to "gamble" that his son would be old enough to start a family in five or six years and that the price of a house in the county seat would be eight thousand per cent earlier.

At present, "gambling" lost Wang mingfa sometimes bemoaned, sometimes optimistic. He saw the outbreak as a natural disaster akin to hail and torrential rain, which he had experienced many times in previous years and had long since come to terms with. Get over it. That's what he's been saying lately.

Pork prices went up last year, and his family hasn't had sausage since Chinese New Year. "It's good to eat chicken. What's not to overcome? " He said. In addition, he also felicitates, oneself is a small business. On TV and on the Internet, he's seen really big people, pouring hundreds of pounds of fruit into the ground. "That's real bad luck. You got ta get over it. "

Voice just fell, he again for the bank interest meat ache, "a year fast three thousand! "

More often, he also because the people in the same village "angry in the heart. ".

Someone from the village would come to his shed and say, shame on him. But the sympathy of the country people will soon return to reality.

When Wang Mingfa finished feeling sorry for him, the villagers would always say, "fortunately, it's not the time to Lay Cherries (May in the Gregorian calendar) . If we catch up with the epidemic at that time, the Cherries will certainly not be sold. " Then they turned to worry about the fruit trees in their fields, be Grateful for yourself.
