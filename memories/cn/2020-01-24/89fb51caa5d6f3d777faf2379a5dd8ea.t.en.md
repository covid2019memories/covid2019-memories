Functional Introduction, light business, understand life.

We're actually having second thoughts about whether to publish this today. This is a story that would break your heart. Today, after all, is the New Year's Eve, is a year since can really unload fatigue, immersed in the family reunion happy moment.

But what can I say? Seventeen years after SARS, it may seem like a distant, distant memory to many people. For those who have lost loved ones, it's uprooting.

Those who are gone are not numbers, but fathers, mothers, daughters, sisters, brothers. If everyone could do more, fight for more, be more responsible, and be more professional, maybe many children wouldn't have to live with the pain of loss.

A New Year has begun. Happy New Year to all. I hope the epidemic is over and everyone is safe and well.

After COVID-19 pneumonia, many of those who experienced SARS were brought back to 2003. So did 31-year-old Fang Ning. She was 14 at the time, and five of the eight members of her family were infected with SARS and hospitalized in different hospitals in Beijing before her mother died. Fang Ning and family life, was completely cut into two parts in 2003, the loss of loved ones grief, is unable to get rid of completely. She wanted everyone to take the disease more seriously and not let the sadness return, not just the fear.

Here's a look at the real estate footage.

The day mom was taken to the hospital, I woke up to the sound of a rustle.

She was calling her uncle, whispering that she was ill, asking him to visit her more often, and persuading him to keep some food and common things at home.

It was April 2003, long before the diagnosis, and the rumors of Beijing's closure had spread far and wide, with shelves being looted. Before that, on March 1, the first imported SARS case was confirmed in Beijing. Since the middle of March, the voice of "SARS epidemic" began to ferment everywhere, and everyone was talking about it. Later, the station began updating its diagnostic and probable figures.
The night mom started to have a fever and cough, it was her seventeenth wedding anniversary with Dad. At 14, I pointed to the news on TV and said to my mother, even if you get it, it's OK. The mortality rate is the same as the flu. How can you die of a cold so easily?

That night, I still stubbornly wanted to sleep in the same bed as my mother. In those years, my father often worked late, I was not close to him, before the SARS days I spent with my mother, two people eat, she accompany me to finish the homework, I hold my mother sleep. When I woke up that night, I saw my mother wearing a mask and sitting on the couch. She hadn't slept all night. She was afraid she was getting too close to me, and she was coughing so she wouldn't wake me up. I stood behind her and saw her shoulders trembling.

After hanging up the phone to my uncle, my mother asked me to put on a mask, but I felt it was disrespectful to her, and said they both cried. Mother has no energy to cook, fell on the bed, I cooked frozen dumplings, she ate five, it was her last meal at home.

After dinner, she pointed to a two-inch photograph of herself with her bangs blown up to her liking. She told me if I died, I'd use it at the funeral.

There are eight of us, all living in one building. The first infected uncle, in mid-march, he was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, high fever nearly 40 degrees, after a slight improvement was referred to the district clinic infusion. There were no beds in the clinic, and the 30 square meter room was often filled with about 20 people.

On April 21, uncle was diagnosed. Two days later, it was mom. Then grandma, GRANDPA, brother. Five family members infected with SARS lie in beds at different hospitals in Beijing. I was left alone with my father and my mother.

My family knows more about this epidemic than I do. Uncle went to the hospital before, kneeling on the ground to grandparents Kowtow a head, he worried that he can not come back, to thank the parents of the grace of parenting. Grandma and GRANDPA separated for a moment, they looked at each other, together 47 years, are in that eye. When my mother left, she seemed to know exactly where she was going. She left me a sum of money, a letter, wrapped in a handkerchief, and a picture of me.

Dad dropped everyone off. He left his stuff behind and watched as they entered the quarantine zone one by one. Inside and outside the quarantine zone, separated by a thick plastic sheet, dad remembered his mother's last move, turning around and waving to him.

Later, my dad told me that at that moment he felt as if the ceiling was spinning and the world was Descent and everything had changed.

The first day into the isolation ward, my mother called back crying, food is cold, food is cold, she and the nurse advice, was complaining about "how so many things. ".

A few days later, my mother stopped complaining on the phone about the food. I thought it was getting better, but in fact, she had nothing left to eat. I found out later, looking at her medical records, that she was hooked up to the machine on day five.

She and her uncle were both seriously ill. On the third day, they were transferred to the Temple of Earth Hospital in Beijing. When they were taken to the hospital at 120, uncle saw his mother in a car. He tried to call her, but he coughed as soon as he spoke, and he still regrets it, "If I had known it was the last time, I would have crawled over to see her. "

The days of being isolated at home were painful, even humiliating, and I was afraid that my classmates would find out about my family, that I would be treated as an outcast, that I would deliberately not answer my phone calls, that I would wait a few hours and then go back, creating a sense that I wasn't always at home, it's not an atmosphere with nowhere to go.

When you wake up in the morning, your home smells like Peracetic acid, especially in the bathroom, where the toilet seat is cold and you feel like you've been pricked.

Then there's the waiting. Every morning, the street clerk would knock on the door. They would call the day before, asking for food and supplies for the next day. It's like a docking code. After a couple of shots, I hold my watch and wait five minutes before I open the door and bring it in. Occasionally from the upstairs look down, the staff has long disappeared, no trace. It's my daily ritual of connecting with the outside world.

There wasn't much to look forward to each day, school was closed, air lessons on TV weren't much to listen to, and I wandered around the acetic smelling house in my pajamas. Mobile phone has become my only contact with my mother, I am nervous to hold the phone every day, calling her again and again.

The glare from the screen irritated me, sometimes making it impossible for me to escape, to imagine her, sometimes to remind me that she was on the other side, not far from me. At first MOM's phone was working, and sometimes she would answer it, and I could hear her breathing and coughing heavily, and then it got shorter and shorter, and I never got through.

Fourteen days after uncle's diagnosis, my father and my mother were posted in the most prominent place in the elevator, although we hardly went out. The only time, less than an hour after she went downstairs to take out the trash, the police knocked on the door and said someone had called the police next door. That was my most anxious and boring moment.

The bad news will come soon enough. One day, I woke up, and I heard my dad crying on the phone, and when I hung up, he told me that GRANDPA was gone.

All these years, Dad's been living with guilt. He sent Grandpa to the hospital, GRANDPA only a slight cough, the doctor advised to go home to take medicine to rest. Dad confessed that someone in his family had been diagnosed with SARS, and the doctor immediately recommended hospitalization and isolation treatment.

Even so, GRANDPA and cousin also belong to mild illness, from beginning to end no high fever, they were transferred to Beijing Youan Hospital, in the same ward. The morning of GRANDPA's death, the nurse came to inform them three days after discharge from hospital, cousin went outside the room to fetch water, when he came back, he saw GRANDPA had been lying on the bed, heart attack, rescue ineffective.

It was the 4th of May, and until then, I thought GRANDPA was the first person in the family to die. In the days that followed, I began to get nervous and bet to myself, "if this leaf doesn't move for the next half-minute, it means my mom is alive. " If not, I would laugh, if there's any shaking, I'll burst into tears. I stared at the calendar, calculating whether each day was "auspicious" , until May 14, because of "I want to die" homophonic, I almost collapsed, repeatedly stroking the straight-plate phone keyboard on a few familiar numbers. Within a month, I had scratched three buttons on an almost new phone.

It wasn't until the end of May that my father finally gave up and told me that on May 1, the ninth day of my mother's diagnosis, she had died. There was also a rumor that because of the epidemic, the hospital would not cremate the bodies, and all the bodies would be buried deep underground.

I went back to my room, locked the door, sat against the wall on the floor, and banged my head against the wall until I hit a huge bump. I worried that my mother, who was only 40 years old, was slowly freezing, that the soil would seep into her skin and that her body would be slowly eaten away by bacteria and eaten by insects.

Several dreams, I cling to the arms of her mother asleep, around her neck, she smiled at me, and then a tilt of the head, cut off the breath. The head tilt was so sad that I used to wake up crying and screaming, imagining her at the last second of her life.

I didn't see her body, and when I got it back in August, there was nothing left but her ashes. I held the ashes crying, do not understand a living person, how can become only a few hundred grams of weight?

Later, because of fear of infection, my mother's purse and everything was burned, only then she took the picture of me, the nurse put in a transparent pocket, four corners have disinfection blister white marks, it's the only thing I ever got back.

Now that I think about it, the last time I saw my mother was on TV, she was wearing a blue and white striped hospital gown and an oxygen mask, struggling to make a V for the camera. That piece was used in the propaganda film of the people united against SARS.

The last call she made was to her father, who answered the phone. She said she wanted him to bring her yogurt and fruit tea, neither of which she liked, she explained. They were from the bed next door, she said, to return the favor.

It was the day before her death, because of isolation, unable to send, my father called relatives and friends, but heard that to Ditan Hospital, were declined. Until the next day, a good friend of her mother's helped to deliver it. She stood beside the gatekeeper and wrote down her mother's name over and over again. The person in charge of the handover came in three times, and each of them went back to look up the information, the aunt's heart tightened for a moment, until the last person told her, the person had gone in the morning.

Until now, every Qingming, Dad will take yogurt and fruit tea to the cemetery, that is his regret.

On June 1, my father and I went to pick up my grandmother, who was later placed in the SARS ward of Beijing's Xiaotangshan Hospital, which took just eight days to build and treated 680 confirmed patients, what became known as the Chinese version of Silent Hill, it was dismantled 10 years ago.

Xiaotangshan area was not prosperous in those days, the hospital is a military rehabilitation sanatorium reconstruction, from the G6 Beijing–Lhasa Expressway (Now beijing-tibet Highway) all the way through, you can feel more desolate.

In April 2003, Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital was under construction day and night. Image / visual China
Grandma has no cell phone and no way to communicate with the outside world. She takes hormones during the day and tries to get out of bed. At night, she can't sleep because of the pain in her legs. She later told me that when she couldn't sleep, she could hear the incessant coughing, wailing, and crying in the infirmary.

After 14 days of quarantine, grandma received a medical release form from the CDC. We added 10 days on top of that. Twenty-four days later, I accompanied my grandmother down the stairs. That was the day the World Health Organization announced that Beijing had been removed from the list of SARS affected areas. As soon as we had taken a breath of free air, the old people sitting in the row downstairs immediately dispersed, the only old man who tried to come in with the grandmother was pulled by his daughter-in-law.

And after that, grandma got lonelier. She had not yet come to terms with the fact that her grandfather had left, and that her family had their own aches and pains, and she did not have time to deal with them. Two months after SARS, when I came home from school, I saw my grandmother standing downstairs. The muscles under her eyes seemed to have disappeared overnight. Her bags were drooping, her hair was gray, her hands were behind her, and she had no one to talk to.

I lost my mother at a young age, and the My So-Called Life seems to have lengthened.

During that time, I became self-pitying, self-indulgent, domineering. At home, I hated my father for keeping me in the dark for nearly a month, and my relationship with him was strained; at school, I had Zhang Jie's gone to love me more than anyone in the world on my desk, he seemed to be claiming that he was suffering more than his peers and deserved more care and understanding.

I did get some special attention. School after the resumption of school, the first time to go through a temperature gun test, I took a good temperature at home after school, or repeatedly received unqualified notice.

After being stopped outside the school gate for two weeks, I came up with a plan. I would get up half an hour early every day, take my temperature at home first, make sure it was normal, and then, with a bag of milk that had been iced overnight, I would put one on my forehead and one under my arm, then slowly step by step to go to school, the road met students also never walk with others, for fear of the high temperature in July under the fast walk out of sweat, affect body temperature.

This cautious posture may seem poignant now, but at the time, even when my temperature was no more than 36.5 degrees, I was kept out of the room and even quarreled with the teacher on duty, at one point becoming a well-known "problem student" on campus.

This situation continued until the third day of junior high school. My whole body showed a kind of Slouchy "collapse" and I thought it was "cool" . I wore a big school uniform and did exercises at recess in a deliberately inappropriate manner. I was called to the stage by the teacher, to show the whole school -- as if, in retrospect, that was an act of self-loathing and self-pity. In the most difficult years, I rarely cried, unless it was in a heated argument, or the words of others to spread disdain, tears will flow down.

Even now, nearly 17 years after the death of my family, I am still reflecting on the state I was in. I divided the years into two stages. For the first seven years, I felt sorry for myself, sitting on the bus to see the little girl holding her mother's hand, leaning on her shoulder, I will subconsciously turn away; the next 10 years, I began to feel sorry for them, feel sorry for their lives were suddenly taken away by a plague, and died for no apparent reason.

In 2003, it also became the focal point of our family's divided memory.

Before 2003, my family was a happy family of eight, three generations. After 2003, every year on the 30th night, we would first serve food to GRANDPA and mom, and then eat after the worship. Until now, grandma has not been able to walk out of 2003, because of the miss of her only daughter, she has been crying into dry eye disease, walking in the street, see and mother like people, she will follow all the way, see me, she will occasionally call out her mother's name.

Mother's death was I told grandma, cold, relatives and friends did not move around then, no one told her later. After this, my uncles and my family gradually lost contact. Subconsciously, they think, my mother was "killed" in my home, there is no explanation.

The huge amount of hormones used to treat SARS also gave uncle, grandma and cousin signs of osteoporosis. The most serious is uncle, not long after the cure, he left his job, for an early retirement. His lungs are so fibrotic, he can barely breathe even when he's quiet. Over the years, his legs became thinner and thinner, his femur bones died in many places, and he needed help to get up, lie down or squat down to use the toilet.

He always had the same dream of swimming like a fish in the deep sea, for he could not breathe through gills, and his legs were nowhere to be found.

When this year's outbreak broke out, I could smell the peracetic acid in my memory, and I could feel that society was being torn apart, and patients in Wuhan were stranded, unable to diagnose "COVID-19 pneumonia" , people in other provinces and cities mentioned Wuhan as a place to avoid, and even worse, people would tell jokes and jokes. Fear is normal, but what's more important is to take the disease seriously.

The night before the city was shut down in Wuhan, my father took the subway home. Behind him, two middle aged women were talking loudly. "certainly nothing, we Chinese people, not afraid of death. " "That is, SARS said so serious, not many people died? "

My father told me that he looked over his shoulder and tightened his mask. Later, a news feed on his phone showed that 17 people had died that day in Hubei Province.

This cautious posture may seem poignant now, but at the time, even when my temperature was no more than 36.5 degrees, I was kept out of the room and even quarreled with the teacher on duty, at one point becoming a well-known "problem student" on campus.

This situation continued until the third day of junior high school. My whole body showed a kind of Slouchy "collapse" and I thought it was "cool" . I wore a big school uniform and did exercises at recess in a deliberately inappropriate manner. I was called to the stage by the teacher, to show the whole school -- as if, in retrospect, that was an act of self-loathing and self-pity. In the most difficult years, I rarely cried, unless it was in a heated argument, or the words of others to spread disdain, tears will flow down.

Even now, nearly 17 years after the death of my family, I am still reflecting on the state I was in. I divided the years into two stages. For the first seven years, I felt sorry for myself, sitting on the bus to see the little girl holding her mother's hand, leaning on her shoulder, I will subconsciously turn away; the next 10 years, I began to feel sorry for them, feel sorry for their lives were suddenly taken away by a plague, and died for no apparent reason.

In 2003, it also became the focal point of our family's divided memory.

Before 2003, my family was a happy family of eight, three generations. After 2003, every year on the 30th night, we would first serve food to GRANDPA and mom, and then eat after the worship. Until now, grandma has not been able to walk out of 2003, because of the miss of her only daughter, she has been crying into dry eye disease, walking in the street, see and mother like people, she will follow all the way, see me, she will occasionally call out her mother's name.

Mother's death was I told grandma, cold, relatives and friends did not move around then, no one told her later. After this, my uncles and my family gradually lost contact. Subconsciously, they think, my mother was "killed" in my home, there is no explanation.

The huge amount of hormones used to treat SARS also gave uncle, grandma and cousin signs of osteoporosis. The most serious is uncle, not long after the cure, he left his job, for an early retirement. His lungs are so fibrotic, he can barely breathe even when he's quiet. Over the years, his legs became thinner and thinner, his femur bones died in many places, and he needed help to get up, lie down or squat down to use the toilet.

He always had the same dream of swimming like a fish in the deep sea, for he could not breathe through gills, and his legs were nowhere to be found.

When this year's outbreak broke out, I could smell the peracetic acid in my memory, and I could feel that society was being torn apart, and patients in Wuhan were stranded, unable to diagnose "COVID-19 pneumonia" , people in other provinces and cities mentioned Wuhan as a place to avoid, and even worse, people would tell jokes and jokes. Fear is normal, but what's more important is to take the disease seriously.

The night before the city was shut down in Wuhan, my father took the subway home. Behind him, two middle aged women were talking loudly. "certainly nothing, we Chinese people, not afraid of death. " "That is, SARS said so serious, not many people died? "

My father told me that he looked over his shoulder and tightened his mask. Later, a news feed on his phone showed that 17 people had died that day in Hubei Province.

After COVID-19 pneumonia, many of those who experienced SARS were brought back to 2003. So did 31-year-old Fang Ning. She was 14 at the time, and five of the eight members of her family were infected with SARS and hospitalized in different hospitals in Beijing before her mother died. Fang Ning and family life, was completely cut into two parts in 2003, the loss of loved ones grief, is unable to get rid of completely. She wanted everyone to take the disease more seriously and not let the sadness return, not just the fear.

Here's a look at the real estate footage.

The day mom was taken to the hospital, I woke up to the sound of a rustle.

She was calling her uncle, whispering that she was ill, asking him to visit her more often, and persuading him to keep some food and common things at home.

It was April 2003, long before the diagnosis, and the rumors of Beijing's closure had spread far and wide, with shelves being looted. Before that, on March 1, the first imported SARS case was confirmed in Beijing. Since the middle of March, the voice of "SARS epidemic" began to ferment everywhere, and everyone was talking about it. Later, the station began updating its diagnostic and probable figures.

The night mom started to have a fever and cough, it was her seventeenth wedding anniversary with Dad. At 14, I pointed to the news on TV and said to my mother, even if you get it, it's OK. The mortality rate is the same as the flu. How can you die of a cold so easily?

That night, I still stubbornly wanted to sleep in the same bed as my mother. In those years, my father often worked late, I was not close to him, before the SARS days I spent with my mother, two people eat, she accompany me to finish the homework, I hold my mother sleep. When I woke up that night, I saw my mother wearing a mask and sitting on the couch. She hadn't slept all night. She was afraid she was getting too close to me, and she was coughing so she wouldn't wake me up. I stood behind her and saw her shoulders trembling.

After hanging up the phone to my uncle, my mother asked me to put on a mask, but I felt it was disrespectful to her, and said they both cried. Mother has no energy to cook, fell on the bed, I cooked frozen dumplings, she ate five, it was her last meal at home.

After dinner, she pointed to a two-inch photograph of herself with her bangs blown up to her liking. She told me if I died, I'd use it at the funeral.

There are eight of us, all living in one building. The first infected uncle, in mid-march, he was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, high fever nearly 40 degrees, after a slight improvement was referred to the district clinic infusion. There were no beds in the clinic, and the 30 square meter room was often filled with about 20 people.

On April 21, uncle was diagnosed. Two days later, it was mom. Then grandma, GRANDPA, brother. Five family members infected with SARS lie in beds at different hospitals in Beijing. I was left alone with my father and my mother.

My family knows more about this epidemic than I do. Uncle went to the hospital before, kneeling on the ground to grandparents Kowtow a head, he worried that he can not come back, to thank the parents of the grace of parenting. Grandma and GRANDPA separated for a moment, they looked at each other, together 47 years, are in that eye. When my mother left, she seemed to know exactly where she was going. She left me a sum of money, a letter, wrapped in a handkerchief, and a picture of me.

Dad dropped everyone off. He left his stuff behind and watched as they entered the quarantine zone one by one. Inside and outside the quarantine zone, separated by a thick plastic sheet, dad remembered his mother's last move, turning around and waving to him.

Later, my dad told me that at that moment he felt as if the ceiling was spinning and the world was Descent and everything had changed.

The first day into the isolation ward, my mother called back crying, food is cold, food is cold, she and the nurse advice, was complaining about "how so many things. ".

A few days later, my mother stopped complaining on the phone about the food. I thought it was getting better, but in fact, she had nothing left to eat. I found out later, looking at her medical records, that she was hooked up to the machine on day five.

She and her uncle were both seriously ill. On the third day, they were transferred to the Temple of Earth Hospital in Beijing. When they were taken to the hospital at 120, uncle saw his mother in a car. He tried to call her, but he coughed as soon as he spoke, and he still regrets it, "If I had known it was the last time, I would have crawled over to see her. "

The days of being isolated at home were painful, even humiliating, and I was afraid that my classmates would find out about my family, that I would be treated as an outcast, that I would deliberately not answer my phone calls, that I would wait a few hours and then go back, creating a sense that I wasn't always at home, it's not an atmosphere with nowhere to go.

When you wake up in the morning, your home smells like Peracetic acid, especially in the bathroom, where the toilet seat is cold and you feel like you've been pricked.

Then there's the waiting. Every morning, the street clerk would knock on the door. They would call the day before, asking for food and supplies for the next day. It's like a docking code. After a couple of shots, I hold my watch and wait five minutes before I open the door and bring it in. Occasionally from the upstairs look down, the staff has long disappeared, no trace. It's my daily ritual of connecting with the outside world.

There wasn't much to look forward to each day, school was closed, air lessons on TV weren't much to listen to, and I wandered around the acetic smelling house in my pajamas. Mobile phone has become my only contact with my mother, I am nervous to hold the phone every day, calling her again and again.

The glare from the screen irritated me, sometimes making it impossible for me to escape, to imagine her, sometimes to remind me that she was on the other side, not far from me. At first MOM's phone was working, and sometimes she would answer it, and I could hear her breathing and coughing heavily, and then it got shorter and shorter, and I never got through.

Fourteen days after uncle's diagnosis, my father and my mother were posted in the most prominent place in the elevator, although we hardly went out. The only time, less than an hour after she went downstairs to take out the trash, the police knocked on the door and said someone had called the police next door. That was my most anxious and boring moment.

The bad news will come soon enough. One day, I woke up, and I heard my dad crying on the phone, and when I hung up, he told me that GRANDPA was gone.

All these years, Dad's been living with guilt. He sent Grandpa to the hospital, GRANDPA only a slight cough, the doctor advised to go home to take medicine to rest. Dad confessed that someone in his family had been diagnosed with SARS, and the doctor immediately recommended hospitalization and isolation treatment.

Even so, GRANDPA and cousin also belong to mild illness, from beginning to end no high fever, they were transferred to Beijing Youan Hospital, in the same ward. The morning of GRANDPA's death, the nurse came to inform them three days after discharge from hospital, cousin went outside the room to fetch water, when he came back, he saw GRANDPA had been lying on the bed, heart attack, rescue ineffective.

It was the 4th of May, and until then, I thought GRANDPA was the first person in the family to die. In the days that followed, I began to get nervous and bet to myself, "if this leaf doesn't move for the next half-minute, it means my mom is alive. " If not, I would laugh, if there's any shaking, I'll burst into tears. I stared at the calendar, calculating whether each day was "auspicious" , until May 14, because of "I want to die" homophonic, I almost collapsed, repeatedly stroking the straight-plate phone keyboard on a few familiar numbers. Within a month, I had scratched three buttons on an almost new phone.

It wasn't until the end of May that my father finally gave up and told me that on May 1, the ninth day of my mother's diagnosis, she had died. There was also a rumor that because of the epidemic, the hospital would not cremate the bodies, and all the bodies would be buried deep underground.

I went back to my room, locked the door, sat against the wall on the floor, and banged my head against the wall until I hit a huge bump. I worried that my mother, who was only 40 years old, was slowly freezing, that the soil would seep into her skin and that her body would be slowly eaten away by bacteria and eaten by insects.

Several dreams, I cling to the arms of her mother asleep, around her neck, she smiled at me, and then a tilt of the head, cut off the breath. The head tilt was so sad that I used to wake up crying and screaming, imagining her at the last second of her life.

I didn't see her body, and when I got it back in August, there was nothing left but her ashes. I held the ashes crying, do not understand a living person, how can become only a few hundred grams of weight?

Later, because of fear of infection, my mother's purse and everything was burned, only then she took the picture of me, the nurse put in a transparent pocket, four corners have disinfection blister white marks, it's the only thing I ever got back.

Now that I think about it, the last time I saw my mother was on TV, she was wearing a blue and white striped hospital gown and an oxygen mask, struggling to make a V for the camera. That piece was used in the propaganda film of the people united against SARS.

The last call she made was to her father, who answered the phone. She said she wanted him to bring her yogurt and fruit tea, neither of which she liked, she explained. They were from the bed next door, she said, to return the favor.

It was the day before her death, because of isolation, unable to send, my father called relatives and friends, but heard that to Ditan Hospital, were declined. Until the next day, a good friend of her mother's helped to deliver it. She stood beside the gatekeeper and wrote down her mother's name over and over again. The person in charge of the handover came in three times, and each of them went back to look up the information, the aunt's heart tightened for a moment, until the last person told her, the person had gone in the morning.

Until now, every Qingming, Dad will take yogurt and fruit tea to the cemetery, that is his regret.

On June 1, my father and I went to pick up my grandmother, who was later placed in the SARS ward of Beijing's Xiaotangshan Hospital, which took just eight days to build and treated 680 confirmed patients, what became known as the Chinese version of Silent Hill, it was dismantled 10 years ago.

Xiaotangshan area was not prosperous in those days, the hospital is a military rehabilitation sanatorium reconstruction, from the G6 Beijing–Lhasa Expressway (Now beijing-tibet Highway) all the way through, you can feel more desolate.

Grandma has no cell phone and no way to communicate with the outside world. She takes hormones during the day and tries to get out of bed. At night, she can't sleep because of the pain in her legs. She later told me that when she couldn't sleep, she could hear the incessant coughing, wailing, and crying in the infirmary.

After 14 days of quarantine, grandma received a medical release form from the CDC. We added 10 days on top of that. Twenty-four days later, I accompanied my grandmother down the stairs. That was the day the World Health Organization announced that Beijing had been removed from the list of SARS affected areas. As soon as we had taken a breath of free air, the old people sitting in the row downstairs immediately dispersed, the only old man who tried to come in with the grandmother was pulled by his daughter-in-law.

And after that, grandma got lonelier. She had not yet come to terms with the fact that her grandfather had left, and that her family had their own aches and pains, and she did not have time to deal with them. Two months after SARS, when I came home from school, I saw my grandmother standing downstairs. The muscles under her eyes seemed to have disappeared overnight. Her bags were drooping, her hair was gray, her hands were behind her, and she had no one to talk to.

I lost my mother at a young age, and the My So-Called Life seems to have lengthened.

During that time, I became self-pitying, self-indulgent, domineering. At home, I hated my father for keeping me in the dark for nearly a month, and my relationship with him was strained; at school, I had Zhang Jie's gone to love me more than anyone in the world on my desk, he seemed to be claiming that he was suffering more than his peers and deserved more care and understanding.

I did get some special attention. School after the resumption of school, the first time to go through a temperature gun test, I took a good temperature at home after school, or repeatedly received unqualified notice.

After being stopped outside the school gate for two weeks, I came up with a plan. I would get up half an hour early every day, take my temperature at home first, make sure it was normal, and then, with a bag of milk that had been iced overnight, I would put one on my forehead and one under my arm, then slowly step by step to go to school, the road met students also never walk with others, for fear of the high temperature in July under the fast walk out of sweat, affect body temperature.
