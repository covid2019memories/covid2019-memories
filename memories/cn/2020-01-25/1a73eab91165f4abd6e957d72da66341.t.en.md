On January 19, the high-speed railway from Beijing to Wuhan. The journey was smooth, uncrowded and orderly.

The mood along the way is not so different from the one I used to have when I went home. From time to time I would receive messages from my friends on my cell phone

The train car announced: Ten minutes to the station, the terminal in Wuhan. There was a commotion, Packing Up, putting on coats, and then masks. I sat in row 5, listening to accents from north and south, and I looked back, as colorful masks hung on my head

Foam mask, cotton mask, medical mask, ordinary mask, fashion mask..

When I arrived in Wuhan, my mother came to pick me up. In the Spring Festival tide, the exit surrounded by relatives, soliciting all kinds of people.

Out of the station, in a dark winter clothing, see my mother wearing a bean sand-colored cotton-padded jacket trotted toward me, my first reaction is: angry.

"I thought we agreed to wear masks. "

In fact, almost none of the pickups were wearing them. The oncoming crowd greeted each other in the nude.

From my home to Wuhan Station subway 50 minutes drive, all the way no traffic, life planning convenience. But sensitive I thought this all the way is the infection potential area, in the heart can not help but nervous.

I asked: a while ago, wechat communication, not to say that Wuhan are still wearing masks? My mother seems to feel wronged, the first burst out of this matter, everyone is actually serious.

Check out the chat logs:

December 31,2019
My mother: Come back to see a lot of masks on the subway
My Dad: to prevent, to pay attention to, but do not panic, do not fear, seriously
Me: Get off the subway and drive
My Dad: that's a good idea. Like it

January 1,2020
Wuhan Central Hospital REFUTES RUMOR OF SARS!
After that, the whole thing about masks on the subway went away.

Back on January 19th, at 11 pm, on my way home with my mother, two things were on my mind: 1) pay more attention to my parents; 2) buy a mask.

In the Medicine Cabinet, and I've got a whole box of masks at home, half of them gone. There is a basic reserve, but I want to have more for the new year. January 20, the Community Mouth Pharmacy, the mask was placed in the doorway most conspicuous position, 10 a pack of masks, 20 yuan a pack. People line up to buy medicine suspiciously, anti-inflammatory, anti-cold..

From Beijing to express home, this year to buy home for the New Year, there is an artificial intelligence small speaker, thought to bring back some small fun for parents, but later, but by accident played another role.

January twenty-one, three days before the New Year's Eve dinner. Walking to MEEMAW's house for dinner, relatives are in the early stages of awareness of the epidemic.

As more and more areas of the phone begin to look suspicious, the brain seems paralyzed by the data. In the television, each television station rolls to broadcast is prepares for the Spring Festival each color propaganda and the variety show.

Take out the small speaker, began to broadcast real-time news about Wuhan: COVID-19 new pathology, local situation, expert opinion, hospital plan and so on information poured in, parents also began to pay attention.

But as the New Year's Eve dinner approaches, how can I explain it to the 40-odd members of my family?

According to the arrangement of the family, one day in the father's family side to eat, one day in the mother's family side to eat. Wuhan Sanzhen, my home in Hanyang, sister home in Wuchang, there are other relatives in Hankou. If the family gets together, if they come all the way from three towns, there's an immeasurable risk of infection along the way.

Only the power of the peer to promote the elderly.

"Sis, maybe we should cancel the dinner. "
"I can do both, mainly your parents and my parents. "
"I'll talk to my parents. You do your parents' job. "

During the day, all the New Year's meals were cancelled by telephone, and everyone was quarantined at home by themselves.

The news continued on January twenty-two, when city leaders gave an interview to a CCTV reporter, and we were all looking forward to hearing some words of encouragement from the public.

But it doesn't matter. The official figures are still rising.

"A distant relative of my family has passed away. I don't know if the statistics have been compiled yet. " People talk about this remotely. In the WECHAT group, various messages go back and forth, on one end of the news feed, new data, new areas, new experts, new folklore are constantly being updated; on the other end, all sorts of scaremongering or rumor mongering is going on.

In the family group, everyone retweets videos, screenshots, and news stories that are important to them. Mom and dad were following the stream of information intermittently and stumbling along, hoping to get through it and trying to help their families.

From time to time to see a news involuntary cry out.

"You can't just wear a mask, you have to wear goggles under special circumstances. "
"You can't wear your mask inside out. "
"You may also have no symptoms and no fever. "
……

I don't go out. I don't know what's out there. Go Out, it is to"snap up".

For the Spring Festival before the home prepared some ingredients, but the new year is still a period of time, have to buy some vegetables. "Lu Cai home, Cai Tai, cabbage, pickled mustard tuber, potatoes, noodles, steamed stuffed Bun, steamed bread... can be stored to buy some more... " before going out began to list, but did not think of the market, is another world. Food stalls have been bought sporadic, surging crowds, and poultry prices can not be sold.

In the early hours of January twenty-three, Wuhan declared the city closed.

"If I had known, I wouldn't have let you go home for the New Year. "
"I don't know when I will be able to go back to work in Beijing. "
……

"DISINFECTANT IS GOING TO BE SPRAYED OVER WUHAN! "
"Now the rumor has been refuted. "
……

Is the Spring Festival coming?

On the morning of January twenty-four, my mother gave the order, "get up and eat, and get strong! " 

Everyone is in high spirits, this day early in the morning TV on, "change to the variety channel, " today my home is not rolling news, my parents want to switch back to the mood of the New Year.

In the television, the encouraging program, the Star game is very lively, looks at the program, everybody facial expression is serious.

"What's happening in the community today? " "We haven't received any announcements or notifications about the outbreak yet. " There was only a "warm reminder" in the elevator about the disinfection of the elevator and other public facilities, signed January 21.

6 pm, the family of three dinner simple and simple, staple food dumplings, vegetables and a bowl of lotus root soup bolting.

After the meal, we have to eat two "sugar garlic" , this sweet and salty food, in the weekdays is a life adjustment, at this time to become a mother's secret recipe. "Eat every day, kill poison and bacteria, strengthen the body. "

The three of them were in agreement -- as if

"eat well, don't eat too much meat. "
"Got Ta Save It. "
……

8 p.m. , as usual, the Spring Festival gala kicks off, and the Year of the rat is upon us.

January 24 at 8:00 am, after wiping the bedroom with rubbing alcohol, I am going to pack up and buy some supplies when I go to Zhongbai Supermarket. Now Wuhan's supermarket in addition to the Zhongbai Supermarket and Wushang every day 10:00-17:00 also open the door, other supermarkets basically closed. Yesterday went out to buy nothing, today to buy some daily necessities, a friend said, Zhongbai Supermarket and Martial Arts Merchants can buy daily supplies and food, but masks are out of stock.

On the second day of Wuhan's temporary closure of the Han corridor, there was less anxiety than when the news of the "closure" was first reported. When I received the news that Wuhan was closed to the Han corridor, I was packing up my new year goods to go back to Yangxin County to see my parents. My son was still tidying up his homework and books to read. After hearing the news of the 'closure of the city' , I was in a daze and had no idea what I was going to do.

"Mom, let's go, I'm ready, " my 12-year-old son said, to my relief from the shock. "No, I can't go out now. Call Daddy (GRANDPA) and Jiajia (grandma) to wish you a happy new year. ".

I had my own car, and I thought I would try my luck, because my husband and son and I were very careful after the news of the epidemic came out. There was no cold or fever, so I felt it would not be a big problem to go back to my hometown to see my parents, but the 'closure of the city' shows that, perhaps the epidemic far beyond their imagination, so still choose not to go out, a family of three directly stay at home. After all, what happens on the road is hard to control.

For the Emergency Situation in Wuhan this year, my family and I are quite lucky, no one has caught a cold yet. But in the future, if a family member or friend has a cold or a low-grade fever, I will also advise them to choose not to go to the hospital for the time being, to take medicine at home, observe, drink more water, etc. , because if they have a low-grade fever, they will go to the hospital, if there is no good protection, in the hospital for fear of cross-infection, the situation will be more serious.

The day before yesterday, a friend of mine called me for help. The friend's father, who had come into contact with a shopping friend in south China, now has a double lung infection. As a close contact person of the confirmed patient, he and his mother went to Tongji, Kongyi 11 hospital, Liuyuan, Jinyintan Hospital, Caidian People's Hospital, Qiyuan Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital, etc. For treatment. These hospitals all said that the symptoms were relatively mild, need to be confirmed after the arrangement of beds, it is recommended to see self-isolation first.

All I can do now is disinfect on time, stay inside as long as possible, and make sure that I and my family are healthy.

Tonight is New Year's Eve, my family was supposed to be in Yangxin County with my parents, "Shou Sui" , and my parents prepared a very elegant New Year's dinner of ten dishes and two soups. Now my husband and children and I simply cooked a few dishes, in order to increase the new year's sense of ritual, symbolic of a fish.

Now I deeply feel that the new year can visit friends and relatives is a very happy thing, when this thing is over, be sure to get together with friends and family more, nothing more to see the elderly parents.

When the news first broke on December 10th, we didn't take it seriously enough. And the people around me don't take it seriously.

I have a friend is the Wuhan Liyuan Hospital doctor, he called to tell me the seriousness of the matter, let me go out must wear a mask, do not go out as far as possible to stay at home. I immediately called all my friends who had appointments and canceled all the parties and events, and told them the seriousness of the situation.

Although I miss my daughter working in Beijing, I specifically told her not to go home for the Spring Festival, which I will spend in Beijing first.

In addition, I have a niece, nephew, they were in Wuhan Changhang General Hospital as a nurse, ECG doctor, have constantly sent messages to my wife and I, said the severity of the infection ahead. All of this makes us start to accept this reality and get nervous. Fortunately, up to now, I haven't heard from anyone I know about the infection.

We also watch the news and the precautions. We wear masks when we go out, even when we walk the dog (to the toilet) , and clean the house with alcohol and disinfectant. I think desperate times call for desperate measures.

My wife and I were asleep when the news of the closure was posted at 2 am on January 23rd. The news came at around 5 am that morning. At that time, my first feeling was that I was very glad that I didn't let my daughter go home. It was a very right decision for her to stay in Beijing for the New Year.

During this period, my wife and I have been staying at home, I mainly read, Tea; my wife Practice Calligraphy. Even if you go out, the radius is not more than 500 meters, take out the trash, walk the dog, walk around in the garden of the nearby community, during which we will wear masks, many people on the road are wearing masks.

Due to adequate preparations for the early Spring Festival, our food and living supplies are relatively adequate. On January 21st, we had all the food we needed, so we didn't go to the supermarket after that. I heard it went up a lot.

On New Year's Eve, my wife and I began to make dumplings, Cook some vegetables and drink some wine in the afternoon.

Our current state of mind is cautiously optimistic, daughter will tell us every year to get a flu vaccine, in late autumn 2019, has been with his wife to the CDC, the home medicine is also prepared, in case there are uncomfortable, will do self-isolation. Now that there are clear guidelines for self isolation in the news, we'll be ready for Wanquan District.

When I first started reading the news about pneumonia, it didn't seem like it was that serious, so I didn't take it seriously.

As news began to gather on January 19th, my colleagues and I rushed to buy some face masks. When I woke up on the morning of the 21st and found that everyone in my circle was retweeting Zhong Nanshan's speech, saying the patient had passed on to another person, I was alarmed, too.

Gradually, some small groups on Wechat have fellow villagers in Wuhan in Beijing discussing whether to go back to Wuhan for the Spring Festival. I had planned to go home, but after consulting with my family, my parents advised me not to. On the 22nd, I went to the supermarket to buy disinfectant and cleaned the house thoroughly.

At 5:00 am on the 23rd, when I woke up and saw the news of the city closure in Wuhan, I felt that my parents were open-minded and let me stay in Beijing and not cause any trouble.

My cousin is a doctor in a hospital in Wuhan, fighting in the front line, he close contact with the confirmed patients, the early slightly cough, now improved, we are also kind of relieved.

In the meantime, apart from shopping at the supermarket and pharmacy, I mostly stayed at home and walked and rode my shared bike. When I was shopping in the supermarket, I felt that the price of Jingkelong was OK. I didn't feel the special price increase. Even though the price of meat was too high, the ribs were sold by the block, but I had to buy them before the Spring Festival. In this way, a lot of food has been stockpiled, the Spring Festival holiday is enough. They also walk, or ride shared bikes, mostly.

Because the company prepared a batch of materials ready to donate to the front, New Year's Eve is basically in contact with this matter, and all parties to communicate and coordinate. On New Year's Eve, I had dinner with some colleagues from Hubei who stayed behind in Beijing. We talked about home and work, watched TV and made dumplings together in the evening.

In the evening, I called my parents to ask about the situation there. I was relieved to know that they were healthy. Although it was a pity that I couldn't spend the New Year with my parents, it was a special time after all.

I've taken precautions in Beijing, I've got anti-inflammatory and cold medicines at home, I've promised to wear masks and wash my hands frequently, and I've kept my house well ventilated for half an hour to an hour a day. I think my family in Wuhan and I will survive.

Before 2020, I spent a long time shuttling between Wuhan and Shanghai. In the last week of 2019, among colleagues, I came across a strange undiagnosed pneumonia in Hankou that had been reported but not followed up.

Before the Games, her parents, wechat group, had received an informal notice that a large number of foreigners coming to Han, children and the elderly at home, had better go to the community hospital for a flu vaccination. On the day I was notified, my sister and I called separately for advice and a vaccine appointment.

I've always been on the alert for the flu, especially in 2019. First, the whole family went in and out of the hospital many times last year, and second, the weather in Wuhan last year was a little bit special. The summer in Wuhan used to end around the time of the National Day, but last year, until the end of November, I wore a shirt through security at a high-speed train station, a thin coat draped over my suitcase.

On the last weekend of 2019, I decided to take a break from my fruitless work in Shanghai and return to Wuhan. My elderly parents were more important, so I wrote an email to apply for annual leave. Because of problems like the common flu, pneumonia and other problems of family children, all kinds of tension and speculation in life, not only a few weeks before and after the new outbreak, but before, the heart has a very tight strain.

After the official disclosure of the new coronavirus, the sister's family booked a long trip to Zhuhai in Guangzhou early, hesitating before finally leaving the city the day before.

My parents go back and forth daily between a fixed supermarket and home, but before the last day of shopping, I forced them to stay at home, buy what I go, how much I can carry home. On the last day of shopping in Fengcheng, I went to two supermarkets. A large supermarket, the majority of young people, more than 90% wear masks, I am very happy. In the crowd, a teenager wearing a gas mask. In the other supermarket, where mothers and aunts were in the majority, 90% had no face masks, including a receptionist.
When buying vegetables, the aunts who do not wear masks are laughing and chatting around me. Fresh stall, fish killing brother will be hanging mask under the nostrils, from time to time to tell me that the rise in fish prices is due to the increase in wholesale prices and so on, do not care about their two dry cough. Outside the supermarket, on every street, does he know? Probably heard about it, but didn't take it to heart.

I stood a meter away from him hesitantly, because I couldn't buy an N95 mask or a surgical mask. I only had the blue one that cost $8.10 in the hospital supermarket when the child was admitted. What I didn't get, not just the masks, but everything I needed to deal with it, I was in short supply, and I had to rely on backup.

When I left the supermarket, I remembered that someone said that we could go to watsons. The girl in the shop regretted that she had no more masks. They were just sold out, so she could come early tomorrow. But she wasn't wearing a mask herself, and I wanted to remind her that so many people were coming and going every day, so many potential carriers.

The city was closed at dawn on the 23rd. A few hours before the siege, I urged my friend not to return home on the 23rd, when she was due to take the 9:00 a.m. high-speed train. Because the Hankou Railway Station is too dangerous. She got permission from her parents, but she didn't get it. I persuaded her that, in addition to being Hankou Railway Station, you were also dangerous. How do you know you're not a potential carrier? And the ability of medical assistance in small cities, how can you guarantee that you can be promptly sent back to Wuhan after knowing that you have been infected?

My cousin's family has been driving away from Wuhan, 23 all day, I did nothing, every hour, Taobao Jingdong Amazon Yiyan selected have like brush a mask, a few times, think the order was successful, less than half an hour, pay back. The rest of the time, check your wechat group. The curious thing about random information is how much is lurking behind it.

In the meantime, I'm trying to figure out, if I or my family were to be infected, and the symptoms showed up a few days later, which hospital would I have to go to? How? How is the route planned? How do you make a complete and effective presentation to your doctor? How do you fight for the chance to be saved?

I created a document to record my and my family's physical symptoms since the 20th, such as a dry cough since the 22nd, slightly aggravated on the 23rd, not excluding the 22nd, moved to two supermarkets, hot and wet down jacket. Wake up in the early morning of the 24th, throat a little swelling and pain, not only itchy, oral honey, slightly improved. Parents'physical condition should be recorded not only in the document, but also in the heart.

Why do some people leave Wuhan? After looking at the Wuhan case from a few other places, I think I have a slight idea. So I said in my family group, if I was infected, I might also drive to Nanjing or Changsha or Guangzhou, stay in Wuhan, medical resources may not be allocated to me.

Actually, I can't drive out of Wuhan Right now. I haven't left my room in 48 hours. My parents and I do not see each other, only calls, New Year's Eve can not pass, reunion dinner naturally did not eat. Mom and dad cooked the meal, I want to give my mom's Bee sanitizer mask, one on the door, one on the door, exchange.

This morning, my mom called to say that she had a sore throat all day yesterday, and after drinking a lot of water, it went away this morning. I was angry with her for not telling me yesterday. I told her at length, "If you have symptoms, I can manage them if they are less severe. I can buy medicine. If you don't tell me, you are 66 years old. If you are out of control, who can I call for help? "

There are many, many people in Wuhan who need help right now.

Talking to my mom on the phone, I realized I was GONNA cry. I suddenly realized that my mother was 66 years old. When did I first become aware of her age? I always thought she was forty, and every picture I took of her was so young. How can I protect my parents?

I mean, we could use a little more outside help, maybe the heroes are on their way, maybe we could all be citizens. But all I can do now is open the file to record the following: Road met Cough Man, the third day, still strong, noon ribs noodles, appetite is OK.

The first patient was reported in December. At that time, I felt that, just like the plague in Beijing at that time, I would tell my family, tell them to be careful, but I didn't know how to avoid it, the overall state of the disease is not entirely clear to us.

Informed friends and family, but did not let them wear a mask, think it is not serious, do not know how to infect, do not have any concept.

Realizing the seriousness, I returned to Wuhan on January 19, and at 11 p.m. , my friends began frantically forwarding me messages, some official, some undetermined.

I haven't been outside since the 20th. And then I told my family not to leave the house. We were supposed to have New Year's Eve dinner after the 20th, and then both grandma and GRANDPA's house and Grandma's house were canceled. Then the house started to be properly ventilated, mopping the floor with disinfectant.

No one I knew directly was infected, but someone I knew indirectly, was a doctor at the hospital, and the doctor got infected, stepped down, and quarantined himself. There is no specific medicine for this disease, just rely on resistance to carry it, carry it over, carry it over, there is no way.

In fact, on the afternoon of January 22, my friend in Beijing sent me a message saying that Wuhan might be closed off. I didn't believe it at the time, because everyone knew that we had never experienced such a thing. I tried to explain it to him. The next day to see the news of the closure of the city, but also not particularly surprised. Or do you think the seriousness of this is suddenly apparent.

My parents didn't want to wear masks when they went out. On the 23rd, the news of the closure of the city was released, and my parents became very nervous. I think the news is quite effective for the middle-aged and elderly people, that is, it will immediately increase their initiative awareness of the disease and enhance their awareness of prevention.

When I got back, I was planning to go to Thailand and change my ticket, but it wasn't that bad.

When things got really bad, I decided not to leave. After all, even my parents are in Wuhan, if I am alone in the field, I will be particularly worried about them.

I haven't been out since the city was closed. My mother went out once, that is, to buy vegetables. The prices of those vegetables in the supermarket that have not gone up by a very large amount have certainly gone up. Many people have tried to grab them, and the supermarket has been robbed of its stock and can not be replenished at once. The streets of Wuhan are now almost empty.

The hardest things to buy were medical supplies and masks, because all my out-of-town friends made me wear masks or sterilize with alcohol. But you can't buy a mask at this point if you don't have a stash of masks or a stash of alcohol, so I'm using the basic blue, air-leaking mask.

Wuhan has no concept of Spring Festival any more. All topics discussed with family and friends are epidemic. Family groups used to send blessings and red envelopes to their elders and friends around the Spring Festival, this year, people just keep retweeting. How do you prevent disease? How do I disinfect my home?

I haven't been outside since the 20th, my house is on the street, the street has been empty since the 22nd, and on the 23rd, the car that cleans the street keeps driving underneath. And there were no pedestrians.

On the 19th, no one on the street was wearing a mask. Then, on the 20th, about 50-50,50-50,50-50,50-50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,5.

At 6:00 the day before yesterday, some grandma and Grandpa were chatting loudly downstairs, because of the epidemic this matter has generated some dispute and discussion, is still very nervous. I saw in those group chats in Wuhan that some young people feel that their situation is not very stable.

I'm not afraid at all, although I can't go on holiday to the place I've been looking forward to for a long time, and the money for travel booking is probably wasted. And estimated that the closure of Wuhan do not know when the end, years after the normal work can not be carried out, it is certainly. I think that's the reality, and when it does, it disrupts the rhythm of your life.

My friend's house is next to the hospital, my mother is also a doctor, orthopedics and gynecology are also scheduled to work. Friends said that the ambulance next to the hospital sound in 20-22 did not break. Because of the new outbreak of disease, medical resources are scarce, a relative of my family just finished surgery, complications pneumonia has also entered the ICU, ill at the wrong time. I talked with my friends all day and felt angry. We don't seem to have enough supplies. The frontline doctors are working hard.

On New Year's Eve I heard someone screaming down there early in the morning and woke up about six o'clock. And I found out that an old lady in the neighborhood had collapsed. I've been talking to friends who've been comforting me ever since. I can't think of anything else to do.

The morning to eat beef noodles (beef less) , afternoon want to go out to buy food to give up. Then a person in the room on the New Year, ready to play a game with friends to relax.

My New Year's Eve dinner was eaten separately from my parents. My father was sleeping with a fever. My mother ate on the first floor and I ate on the second floor.

Settled in Wuhan two years ago

I had planned to drive back to my hometown with friends early on the morning of the 24th. The News of the closure of the city came too suddenly. The passage leaving Wuhan at 10 a.m. on the 23rd was all closed. I only saw the news in my friend circle around 8 a.m. that day, i just got out of bed. I couldn't believe it. I waited to call my friends. We decided not to go back this year, even though the highway was not completely closed at that time.

I went to college in Wuhan and worked in Beijing for seven or eight years after graduation. Two years ago I had a child and moved to Wuhan. I have deep feelings for Wuhan and fully understand the matter of sealing off the city, and I have seen academician Zhong Nanshan say on the news before that this epidemic has already resulted in human to human transmission. In the big picture, we can make a little sacrifice.

I live just a few kilometers away from the south China Seafood Market. The News said that it might be the source of the outbreak. On the morning of the city closure, I saw Meituan and Hema Xiansheng preparing to place an order, i found that vegetables, fruits and pork were almost sold out, so I had to go out to a nearby supermarket.

I had just bought a generic surgical mask, and I went out the other day and wore two of them, covered them up. Wuhan recently very cold, sporadic pedestrians mostly wearing masks curled up body, of course, occasionally can see a few people do not wear masks.

There were so many people in that supermarket that there was a long line at every checkout aisle. The supply of goods in the supermarket was normal that morning. There was no shortage of goods and no obvious increase in prices. I bought food -- Rice, vegetables, fruit, PORK -- and a box of farmer's springs and 20 boxes of instant noodles, which felt like déjà Vu in a movie.

Wuhan confirmed the number of people are increasing every day, now everyone does not go out, probably only the supermarket and the hospital more people.

My wife took the kids home a week ago because of the Hukou problem, but I didn't expect the situation to change so quickly. This morning she sent me a home to buy a photo of New Year's Eve, so big for the first time did not go home for the new year, really feel bad.

A person's New Year's Eve, dinner I eat simple, a dish of shrimp, a bowl of rice, a glass of wine is all. Then, I made a video call with my family and told them to take care of themselves and put on a mask when they went out.

A high school classmate sent me a message of condolence on New Year's Eve, which reminded me of many years ago, when I was a freshman at Ensch high school in 2003, I was in SARS, some students went over the courtyard wall to buy, I asked someone to bring me a T-sleeve, a dozen dollars, especially poor quality wear two days on the ball. Roommate, the high school classmate, had a small sleeve and sold it to me at a discount. When I told him about it, he couldn't remember it.

Back in December, we had a feeling the virus wasn't too serious. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, some people began to stock up on Radix Isatidis, face masks, cotton clear, oral liquid and so on on January 10.

I returned to Wuhan on January 17, and my family started talking about it, but it wasn't that serious at the time. It's not uncommon to go shopping, or to go out, on January 18th, when there are a few scattered people wearing masks. But when people talk about it, they don't think it's as bad as it sounds around them.

When I returned to Jingzhou from Wuhan on January 19, I was still very conscious to wear a mask. By then, the south China seafood market had been closed, and the Hankou Railway Station was next door. But there weren't too many people wearing masks at the train station that day, and I was one of the ones who was really nervous.

Later, when academician Zhong Nanshan announced in the news that people could be passed on from one person to another, public opinion became more and more serious, and the Wuhan side, including my parents, relatives and friends, began to attach importance to this matter. Before Wuhan People Oneself also in make fun of, did not take this matter very seriously.

After this was confirmed, our family reunion dinner was canceled. My mother was in all kinds of groups, traveling groups, square dancing groups all had publicity. One aunt called for the family reunion dinner to be returned. My family has also returned hotel and plane tickets to various places.

Our friends around the diagnosis or infection, we know Wuhan residents are very conscious. We don't go to people's houses. We don't let people into our houses. It's basically what everyone I know in my family and friends does. Then I know the relatives and friends did not flee Wuhan.

When we heard that Wuhan was getting worse, we thought about taking a car out, but with the news pouring in, we decided to stay home and be safe.

At that time said that when the city closed, also discussed whether to drive out of the city, but in the end decided unanimously to stay in Wuhan. Many native-born Wuhan people, are a very large family, dozens of people. The News said it would guarantee the electricity, water and gas consumption of Wuhan residents, including food and vegetables. To be honest, our families are not panicking.

Feeling some supermarkets, vegetable markets, Huimin supermarkets, also did not rise in price, Yongwang supermarket for a period of time, but those kinds of dishes are expensive, even if there is no epidemic, the price will rise every new year. Douyin uploaded some of the expensive dishes, in fact, is a clean or boutique dishes, already expensive.

But also does not rule out some people to bid up, the unscrupulous businessman always has. As Wuhan people, it is very angry, some netizens and not in Wuhan, but like to put some negative information unlimited amplification, we feel that Wuhan is not to power. We were sealed off in a city under siege, and if the bad press gets out, people will panic. Originally this supermarket did not happen to rob, because there are users retweeted, we go to the supermarket to rob, this will only increase our panic.

I have a personal experience. Some people say that cabbages in Wuhan cost 70 yuan a piece and 100 yuan a piece. I attach the real price receipt of things to his Weibo. Many netizens in Wuhan do the same.

Someone asked Wuhan people what is the biggest problem, we comment is now Wuhan is most afraid of rumors or false reports. To create this kind of scandal, or to make this kind of false statement, which makes everyone panic, is the worst evil to Wuhan.

At home, we really only have to watch TV and watch mobile phones. Originally, our relatives lived just a block away from us. We didn't go to their homes, we didn't let them come to our homes, and we didn't play Mahjong, just in case there's an increased risk of getting the virus out the door.

Now life has been very boring, at home is eat sleep, sleep eat. I just wish there were less bad news or false news on the Internet.

The streets are almost empty now, empty, and everyone wears a mask. On the morning of New Year's Eve, the community came to our house to hand out the citizens'proposal. It is also false to say that we are not afraid, but we still believe in the government and believe in the party. I hope we people in Wuhan can get through this difficult time.

Migrant workers in Wuhan

I came to Wuhan in 2017, is Henan Jiaozuo People, currently living in Swan Lake Avenue here, is a factory staff.

I didn't get the news that the first chart appeared on December 10th, and my colleagues didn't know about it. I know the news is also a colleague told me, is in December 25, there was a large-scale pneumonia in Wuhan.

My kids go to school here, and if a student has a fever or a cold, they go for treatment, but the school isn't closed, it's still in session. I wear clean clothes and disinfect my hands in the factory.

On December 25, a colleague or friend sent out screenshots of the group, but no official word was received. We don't really care, because it's not official, it's just gossip. On New Year's Day, I took my family out wearing masks. On New Year's Day, I saw very few people wearing masks on the banks of the Yangtze River. Basically, people in Wuhan didn't pay much attention to these things. Then, on January 8th, the school closed, the school broke up on the 15th, and there were no large numbers of people wearing masks when picking up the children.

The serious thing is that on the 19th, the authorities have sent out a message, saying that this is a very serious condition, with a large number of sources of infection. One after the other. I think they're wearing masks.

On the afternoon of the 19th, our factory began to have a holiday, and I stayed at home to keep an eye on the situation. I am now a person in Wuhan Chinese New Year, also do not want to give the family members and the old family brought illness hidden danger.

I went out on the 20th to buy a lot of instant noodles, to stock up on food for myself, and to the local market, but few people wear masks. I wear two layers of mask, one inside, one outside.

I was driving around yesterday, trying to stock up on more masks. Went to a couple of pharmacies, the first three were sold out last Friday, the fourth one, 15 bucks a pop. At this time Wuhan is the traffic, very few people out of the activities, basically put on a mask. The supermarket food is still sufficient, the thing is also quite many, has not snapped up this situation.

New Year's Eve at home alone, can only be to see a movie, see the New Year's Eve party.

I am more rational about the spread of the new virus, because I understand that the disease is human-to-human transmission, so as long as I do not contact people, it should not be too big problem, of course, protection is inevitable. What really worries me is that the new hospital is not far from here.

On January 21, having been away from home for half a year, I boarded the G527 train from Beijing and hurried back to my hometown in Wuhan. I asked my family about the outbreak in Wuhan before I left, and got the reply: Everything is as usual here, not as serious as the outside propaganda.

When I got out of the car, what I saw seemed to confirm what my family had told me. Less than half of the people who came and went wore masks. "It's just a normal Spring Festival, " I thought, as I pulled on my mask and lugged a heavy suitcase through the crowd to get home.

Reports continued to pour in, and more and more cases of infection in other provinces made me think it was more than just a case of flu. The cumulative death toll only increased my suspicions until the news of the closure of Wuhan.

Like everyone else, I was immediately nervous and rushed to a nearby pharmacy to try to stock up on face masks, and there was a long line of them. Many people are Chengdou buy, originally only want to buy masks, see others buy medical alcohol oneself also took alcohol, see others buy cold medicine oneself also buy cold medicine, lost reason, also have no judgment.

Masks are sold only over the counter, at $25 each, and each person is limited to five. The girl behind the counter said, "XX county sells the same mask for 35 yuan, but our boss won't let the price go up to 25 yuan. "

I asked if it was an N95, and the cashier pointed to the "filter: N95" printed in the upper right corner of the package and told him it was a genuine N95. When I got home, I saw the "filter rate 99" on the package. I was suspicious again. I went to JD.com and checked the price of the same type of mask. The price is 150 yuan for 100 masks. "there is better than no. " I finally chose to swallow it.

At this time of year, few people began to walk in the busy streets, and nearly everyone wore masks. The Vegetable Market Wharf, the bus station, also the subway station are all sealed off, even the large-scale shopping mall also has few traces of walking. And now Wuhan residents of the only way to travel by car, in order to deal with the emergency gas stations are also in normal operation.

Now, the entire Wuhan people are aware of the seriousness of the incident, I also accept the reality slowly come over.

Ever since I got home, I've been holed up at home, afraid to go out, except to watch TV or watch the news. I can often get SMS notifications about the Wuhan Epidemic. The CHENGGUAN are now on the front line, sterilizing the streets. Government and government agencies are involved in advertising everywhere, not allowed to go out to visit relatives and friends. I also canceled the party plans, plans to visit relatives and friends have been canceled or refused on the phone.

Privately, I've heard that people in Wuhan can still get out of the city by the back roads, and there are private cars at the moment, charging nearly 1,500 a person. It would have been better if we had blocked off the traffic, at least we wouldn't be stuck here. I still hope that Wuhan will be unsealed as soon as possible, after all, I have to return to Beijing to work.

On This Day, the family did not prepare the New Year's Eve dinner, but simply prepared some home-cooked dishes. After eating, the family quietly gathered around the TV set, perhaps more than the singing and dancing show, the latest development of the Wuhan epidemic can stir our hearts that the string of collapse.

"Happy New Year! " As usual, I received a lot of New Year wishes from friends and relatives, a few simple greetings will be "to go out as little as possible, " "to protect themselves, " and so on. Looking out of the window, the Long Street, only a handful of pedestrians, through the mask who do not recognize who, cloudy cold winter over Wuhan, fireworks rare many. The kids are hiding, too.

On January 19, the high-speed railway from Beijing to Wuhan. The journey was smooth, uncrowded and orderly.

The mood along the way is not so different from the one I used to have when I went home. From time to time I would receive messages from my friends on my cell phone

The train car announced: Ten minutes to the station, the terminal in Wuhan. There was a commotion, Packing Up, putting on coats, and then masks. I sat in row 5, listening to accents from north and south, and I looked back, as colorful masks hung on my head

Foam mask, cotton mask, medical mask, ordinary mask, fashion mask..

When I arrived in Wuhan, my mother came to pick me up. In the Spring Festival tide, the exit surrounded by relatives, soliciting all kinds of people.

Out of the station, in a dark winter clothing, see my mother wearing a bean sand-colored cotton-padded jacket trotted toward me, my first reaction is: angry.

"I thought we agreed to wear masks. "

In fact, almost none of the pickups were wearing them. The oncoming crowd greeted each other in the nude.

From my home to Wuhan Station subway 50 minutes drive, all the way no traffic, life planning convenience. But sensitive I thought this all the way is the infection potential area, in the heart can not help but nervous.

I asked: a while ago, wechat communication, not to say that Wuhan are still wearing masks? My mother seems to feel wronged, the first burst out of this matter, everyone is actually serious.

Check out the chat logs:

December 31,2019
My mother: Come back to see a lot of masks on the subway
My Dad: to prevent, to pay attention to, but do not panic, do not fear, seriously
Me: Get off the subway and drive
My Dad: that's a good idea. Like it

January 1,2020
Wuhan Central Hospital REFUTES RUMOR OF SARS!
After that, the whole thing about masks on the subway went away.

Back on January 19th, at 11 pm, on my way home with my mother, two things were on my mind: 1) pay more attention to my parents; 2) buy a mask.

In the Medicine Cabinet, and I've got a whole box of masks at home, half of them gone. There is a basic reserve, but I want to have more for the new year. January 20, the Community Mouth Pharmacy, the mask was placed in the doorway most conspicuous position, 10 a pack of masks, 20 yuan a pack. People line up to buy medicine suspiciously, anti-inflammatory, anti-cold..

From Beijing to express home, this year to buy home for the New Year, there is an artificial intelligence small speaker, thought to bring back some small fun for parents, but later, but by accident played another role.

January twenty-one, three days before the New Year's Eve dinner. Walking to MEEMAW's house for dinner, relatives are in the early stages of awareness of the epidemic.

As more and more areas of the phone begin to look suspicious, the brain seems paralyzed by the data. In the television, each television station rolls to broadcast is prepares for the Spring Festival each color propaganda and the variety show.

Take out the small speaker, began to broadcast real-time news about Wuhan: COVID-19 new pathology, local situation, expert opinion, hospital plan and so on information poured in, parents also began to pay attention.

But as the New Year's Eve dinner approaches, how can I explain it to the 40-odd members of my family?

According to the arrangement of the family, one day in the father's family side to eat, one day in the mother's family side to eat. Wuhan Sanzhen, my home in Hanyang, sister home in Wuchang, there are other relatives in Hankou. If the family gets together, if they come all the way from three towns, there's an immeasurable risk of infection along the way.

Only the power of the peer to promote the elderly.

"Sis, maybe we should cancel the dinner. "
"I can do both, mainly your parents and my parents. "
"I'll talk to my parents. You do your parents' job. "

During the day, all the New Year's meals were cancelled by telephone, and everyone was quarantined at home by themselves.

The news continued on January twenty-two, when city leaders gave an interview to a CCTV reporter, and we were all looking forward to hearing some words of encouragement from the public.

But it doesn't matter. The official figures are still rising.

"A distant relative of my family has passed away. I don't know if the statistics have been compiled yet. " People talk about this remotely. In the WECHAT group, various messages go back and forth, on one end of the news feed, new data, new areas, new experts, new folklore are constantly being updated; on the other end, all sorts of scaremongering or rumor mongering is going on.

In the family group, everyone retweets videos, screenshots, and news stories that are important to them. Mom and dad were following the stream of information intermittently and stumbling along, hoping to get through it and trying to help their families.

From time to time to see a news involuntary cry out.

"You can't just wear a mask, you have to wear goggles under special circumstances. "
"You can't wear your mask inside out. "
"You may also have no symptoms and no fever. "
……

I don't go out. I don't know what's out there. Go Out, it is to"snap up".

For the Spring Festival before the home prepared some ingredients, but the new year is still a period of time, have to buy some vegetables. "Lu Cai home, Cai Tai, cabbage, pickled mustard tuber, potatoes, noodles, steamed stuffed Bun, steamed bread... can be stored to buy some more... " before going out began to list, but did not think of the market, is another world. Food stalls have been bought sporadic, surging crowds, and poultry prices can not be sold.

In the early hours of January twenty-three, Wuhan declared the city closed.

"If I had known, I wouldn't have let you go home for the New Year. "
"I don't know when I will be able to go back to work in Beijing. "
……

"DISINFECTANT IS GOING TO BE SPRAYED OVER WUHAN! "
"Now the rumor has been refuted. "
……

Is the Spring Festival coming?

On the morning of January twenty-four, my mother gave the order, "get up and eat, and get strong! " 

Everyone is in high spirits, this day early in the morning TV on, "change to the variety channel, " today my home is not rolling news, my parents want to switch back to the mood of the New Year.

In the television, the encouraging program, the Star game is very lively, looks at the program, everybody facial expression is serious.

"What's happening in the community today? " "We haven't received any announcements or notifications about the outbreak yet. " There was only a "warm reminder" in the elevator about the disinfection of the elevator and other public facilities, signed January 21.

6 pm, the family of three dinner simple and simple, staple food dumplings, vegetables and a bowl of lotus root soup bolting.

After the meal, we have to eat two "sugar garlic" , this sweet and salty food, in the weekdays is a life adjustment, at this time to become a mother's secret recipe. "Eat every day, kill poison and bacteria, strengthen the body. "

On January 19, the high-speed railway from Beijing to Wuhan. The journey was smooth, uncrowded and orderly.

The mood along the way is not so different from the one I used to have when I went home. From time to time I would receive messages from my friends on my cell phone

The train car announced: Ten minutes to the station, the terminal in Wuhan. There was a commotion, Packing Up, putting on coats, and then masks. I sat in row 5, listening to accents from north and south, and I looked back, as colorful masks hung on my head

Foam mask, cotton mask, medical mask, ordinary mask, fashion mask..

When I arrived in Wuhan, my mother came to pick me up. In the Spring Festival tide, the exit surrounded by relatives, soliciting all kinds of people.

Out of the station, in a dark winter clothing, see my mother wearing a bean sand-colored cotton-padded jacket trotted toward me, my first reaction is: angry.

"I thought we agreed to wear masks. "

In fact, almost none of the pickups were wearing them. The oncoming crowd greeted each other in the nude.

From my home to Wuhan Station subway 50 minutes drive, all the way no traffic, life planning convenience. But sensitive I thought this all the way is the infection potential area, in the heart can not help but nervous.

I asked: a while ago, wechat communication, not to say that Wuhan are still wearing masks? My mother seems to feel wronged, the first burst out of this matter, everyone is actually serious.

Check out the chat logs:

December 31,2019

My mother: Come back to see a lot of masks on the subway

My Dad: to prevent, to pay attention to, but do not panic, do not fear, seriously

Me: Get off the subway and drive

My Dad: that's a good idea. Like it

January 1,2020

Wuhan Central Hospital REFUTES RUMOR OF SARS!

After that, the whole thing about masks on the subway went away.

Back on January 19th, at 11 pm, on my way home with my mother, two things were on my mind: 1) pay more attention to my parents; 2) buy a mask.

In the Medicine Cabinet, and I've got a whole box of masks at home, half of them gone. There is a basic reserve, but I want to have more for the new year. January 20, the Community Mouth Pharmacy, the mask was placed in the doorway most conspicuous position, 10 a pack of masks, 20 yuan a pack. People line up to buy medicine suspiciously, anti-inflammatory, anti-cold..

From Beijing to express home, this year to buy home for the New Year, there is an artificial intelligence small speaker, thought to bring back some small fun for parents, but later, but by accident played another role.

January twenty-one, three days before the New Year's Eve dinner. Walking to MEEMAW's house for dinner, relatives are in the early stages of awareness of the epidemic.

As more and more areas of the phone begin to look suspicious, the brain seems paralyzed by the data. In the television, each television station rolls to broadcast is prepares for the Spring Festival each color propaganda and the variety show.

Take out the small speaker, began to broadcast real-time news about Wuhan: COVID-19 new pathology, local situation, expert opinion, hospital plan and so on information poured in, parents also began to pay attention.

But as the New Year's Eve dinner approaches, how can I explain it to the 40-odd members of my family?

According to the arrangement of the family, one day in the father's family side to eat, one day in the mother's family side to eat. Wuhan Sanzhen, my home in Hanyang, sister home in Wuchang, there are other relatives in Hankou. If the family gets together, if they come all the way from three towns, there's an immeasurable risk of infection along the way.

Only the power of the peer to promote the elderly.

"Sis, maybe we should cancel the dinner. "

"I can do both, mainly your parents and my parents. "

"I'll talk to my parents. You do your parents' job. "

During the day, all the New Year's meals were cancelled by telephone, and everyone was quarantined at home by themselves.

The news continued on January twenty-two, when city leaders gave an interview to a CCTV reporter, and we were all looking forward to hearing some words of encouragement from the public.

But it doesn't matter. The official figures are still rising.

"A distant relative of my family has passed away. I don't know if the statistics have been compiled yet. " People talk about this remotely. In the WECHAT group, various messages go back and forth, on one end of the news feed, new data, new areas, new experts, new folklore are constantly being updated; on the other end, all sorts of scaremongering or rumor mongering is going on.

January 24 at 8:00 am, after wiping the bedroom with rubbing alcohol, I am going to pack up and buy some supplies when I go to Zhongbai Supermarket. Now Wuhan's supermarket in addition to the Zhongbai Supermarket and Wushang every day 10:00-17:00 also open the door, other supermarkets basically closed. Yesterday went out to buy nothing, today to buy some daily necessities, a friend said, Zhongbai Supermarket and Martial Arts Merchants can buy daily supplies and food, but masks are out of stock.

On the second day of Wuhan's temporary closure of the Han corridor, there was less anxiety than when the news of the "closure" was first reported. When I received the news that Wuhan was closed to the Han corridor, I was packing up my new year goods to go back to Yangxin County to see my parents. My son was still tidying up his homework and books to read. After hearing the news of the 'closure of the city' , I was in a daze and had no idea what I was going to do.

"Mom, let's go, I'm ready, " my 12-year-old son said, to my relief from the shock. "No, I can't go out now. Call Daddy (GRANDPA) and Jiajia (grandma) to wish you a happy new year. ".

I had my own car, and I thought I would try my luck, because my husband and son and I were very careful after the news of the epidemic came out. There was no cold or fever, so I felt it would not be a big problem to go back to my hometown to see my parents, but the 'closure of the city' shows that, perhaps the epidemic far beyond their imagination, so still choose not to go out, a family of three directly stay at home. After all, what happens on the road is hard to control.

For the Emergency Situation in Wuhan this year, my family and I are quite lucky, no one has caught a cold yet. But in the future, if a family member or friend has a cold or a low-grade fever, I will also advise them to choose not to go to the hospital for the time being, to take medicine at home, observe, drink more water, etc. , because if they have a low-grade fever, they will go to the hospital, if there is no good protection, in the hospital for fear of cross-infection, the situation will be more serious.

The day before yesterday, a friend of mine called me for help. The friend's father, who had come into contact with a shopping friend in south China, now has a double lung infection. As a close contact person of the confirmed patient, he and his mother went to Tongji, Kongyi 11 hospital, Liuyuan, Jinyintan Hospital, Caidian People's Hospital, Qiyuan Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital, etc. For treatment. These hospitals all said that the symptoms were relatively mild, need to be confirmed after the arrangement of beds, it is recommended to see self-isolation first.

All I can do now is disinfect on time, stay inside as long as possible, and make sure that I and my family are healthy.

Tonight is New Year's Eve, my family was supposed to be in Yangxin County with my parents, "Shou Sui" , and my parents prepared a very elegant New Year's dinner of ten dishes and two soups. Now my husband and children and I simply cooked a few dishes, in order to increase the new year's sense of ritual, symbolic of a fish.

Now I deeply feel that the new year can visit friends and relatives is a very happy thing, when this thing is over, be sure to get together with friends and family more, nothing more to see the elderly parents.

When the news first broke on December 10th, we didn't take it seriously enough. And the people around me don't take it seriously.

I have a friend is the Wuhan Liyuan Hospital doctor, he called to tell me the seriousness of the matter, let me go out must wear a mask, do not go out as far as possible to stay at home. I immediately called all my friends who had appointments and canceled all the parties and events, and told them the seriousness of the situation.

Although I miss my daughter working in Beijing, I specifically told her not to go home for the Spring Festival, which I will spend in Beijing first.

In addition, I have a niece, nephew, they were in Wuhan Changhang General Hospital as a nurse, ECG doctor, have constantly sent messages to my wife and I, said the severity of the infection ahead. All of this makes us start to accept this reality and get nervous. Fortunately, up to now, I haven't heard from anyone I know about the infection.

We also watch the news and the precautions. We wear masks when we go out, even when we walk the dog (to the toilet) , and clean the house with alcohol and disinfectant. I think desperate times call for desperate measures.

My wife and I were asleep when the news of the closure was posted at 2 am on January 23rd. The news came at around 5 am that morning. At that time, my first feeling was that I was very glad that I didn't let my daughter go home. It was a very right decision for her to stay in Beijing for the New Year.

During this period, my wife and I have been staying at home, I mainly read, Tea; my wife Practice Calligraphy. Even if you go out, the radius is not more than 500 meters, take out the trash, walk the dog, walk around in the garden of the nearby community, during which we will wear masks, many people on the road are wearing masks.

Due to adequate preparations for the early Spring Festival, our food and living supplies are relatively adequate. On January 21st, we had all the food we needed, so we didn't go to the supermarket after that. I heard it went up a lot.

On New Year's Eve, my wife and I began to make dumplings, Cook some vegetables and drink some wine in the afternoon.

Our current state of mind is cautiously optimistic, daughter will tell us every year to get a flu vaccine, in late autumn 2019, has been with his wife to the CDC, the home medicine is also prepared, in case there are uncomfortable, will do self-isolation. Now that there are clear guidelines for self isolation in the news, we'll be ready for Wanquan District.

My wife and I were asleep when the news of the closure was posted at 2 am on January 23rd. The news came at around 5 am that morning. At that time, my first feeling was that I was very glad that I didn't let my daughter go home. It was a very right decision for her to stay in Beijing for the New Year.

During this period, my wife and I have been staying at home, I mainly read, Tea; my wife Practice Calligraphy. Even if you go out, the radius is not more than 500 meters, take out the trash, walk the dog, walk around in the garden of the nearby community, during which we will wear masks, many people on the road are wearing masks.

Due to adequate preparations for the early Spring Festival, our food and living supplies are relatively adequate. On January 21st, we had all the food we needed, so we didn't go to the supermarket after that. I heard it went up a lot.

When I first started reading the news about pneumonia, it didn't seem like it was that serious, so I didn't take it seriously.

As news began to gather on January 19th, my colleagues and I rushed to buy some face masks. When I woke up on the morning of the 21st and found that everyone in my circle was retweeting Zhong Nanshan's speech, saying the patient had passed on to another person, I was alarmed, too.

Gradually, some small groups on Wechat have fellow villagers in Wuhan in Beijing discussing whether to go back to Wuhan for the Spring Festival. I had planned to go home, but after consulting with my family, my parents advised me not to. On the 22nd, I went to the supermarket to buy disinfectant and cleaned the house thoroughly.

At 5:00 am on the 23rd, when I woke up and saw the news of the city closure in Wuhan, I felt that my parents were open-minded and let me stay in Beijing and not cause any trouble.

My cousin is a doctor in a hospital in Wuhan, fighting in the front line, he close contact with the confirmed patients, the early slightly cough, now improved, we are also kind of relieved.

In the meantime, apart from shopping at the supermarket and pharmacy, I mostly stayed at home and walked and rode my shared bike. When I was shopping in the supermarket, I felt that the price of Jingkelong was OK. I didn't feel the special price increase. Even though the price of meat was too high, the ribs were sold by the block, but I had to buy them before the Spring Festival. In this way, a lot of food has been stockpiled, the Spring Festival holiday is enough. They also walk, or ride shared bikes, mostly.

Because the company prepared a batch of materials ready to donate to the front, New Year's Eve is basically in contact with this matter, and all parties to communicate and coordinate. On New Year's Eve, I had dinner with some colleagues from Hubei who stayed behind in Beijing. We talked about home and work, watched TV and made dumplings together in the evening.

In the evening, I called my parents to ask about the situation there. I was relieved to know that they were healthy. Although it was a pity that I couldn't spend the New Year with my parents, it was a special time after all.

I've taken precautions in Beijing, I've got anti-inflammatory and cold medicines at home, I've promised to wear masks and wash my hands frequently, and I've kept my house well ventilated for half an hour to an hour a day. I think my family in Wuhan and I will survive.

Before 2020, I spent a long time shuttling between Wuhan and Shanghai. In the last week of 2019, among colleagues, I came across a strange undiagnosed pneumonia in Hankou that had been reported but not followed up.

Before the Games, her parents, wechat group, had received an informal notice that a large number of foreigners coming to Han, children and the elderly at home, had better go to the community hospital for a flu vaccination. On the day I was notified, my sister and I called separately for advice and a vaccine appointment.

I've always been on the alert for the flu, especially in 2019. First, the whole family went in and out of the hospital many times last year, and second, the weather in Wuhan last year was a little bit special. The summer in Wuhan used to end around the time of the National Day, but last year, until the end of November, I wore a shirt through security at a high-speed train station, a thin coat draped over my suitcase.

On the last weekend of 2019, I decided to take a break from my fruitless work in Shanghai and return to Wuhan. My elderly parents were more important, so I wrote an email to apply for annual leave. Because of problems like the common flu, pneumonia and other problems of family children, all kinds of tension and speculation in life, not only a few weeks before and after the new outbreak, but before, the heart has a very tight strain.

After the official disclosure of the new coronavirus, the sister's family booked a long trip to Zhuhai in Guangzhou early, hesitating before finally leaving the city the day before.

My parents go back and forth daily between a fixed supermarket and home, but before the last day of shopping, I forced them to stay at home, buy what I go, how much I can carry home. On the last day of shopping in Fengcheng, I went to two supermarkets. A large supermarket, the majority of young people, more than 90% wear masks, I am very happy. In the crowd, a teenager wearing a gas mask. In the other supermarket, where mothers and aunts were in the majority, 90% had no face masks, including a receptionist.
When buying vegetables, the aunts who do not wear masks are laughing and chatting around me. Fresh stall, fish killing brother will be hanging mask under the nostrils, from time to time to tell me that the rise in fish prices is due to the increase in wholesale prices and so on, do not care about their two dry cough. Outside the supermarket, on every street, does he know? Probably heard about it, but didn't take it to heart.

I stood a meter away from him hesitantly, because I couldn't buy an N95 mask or a surgical mask. I only had the blue one that cost $8.10 in the hospital supermarket when the child was admitted. What I didn't get, not just the masks, but everything I needed to deal with it, I was in short supply, and I had to rely on backup.

When I left the supermarket, I remembered that someone said that we could go to watsons. The girl in the shop regretted that she had no more masks. They were just sold out, so she could come early tomorrow. But she wasn't wearing a mask herself, and I wanted to remind her that so many people were coming and going every day, so many potential carriers.

The city was closed at dawn on the 23rd. A few hours before the siege, I urged my friend not to return home on the 23rd, when she was due to take the 9:00 a.m. high-speed train. Because the Hankou Railway Station is too dangerous. She got permission from her parents, but she didn't get it. I persuaded her that, in addition to being Hankou Railway Station, you were also dangerous. How do you know you're not a potential carrier? And the ability of medical assistance in small cities, how can you guarantee that you can be promptly sent back to Wuhan after knowing that you have been infected?

My cousin's family has been driving away from Wuhan, 23 all day, I did nothing, every hour, Taobao Jingdong Amazon Yiyan selected have like brush a mask, a few times, think the order was successful, less than half an hour, pay back. The rest of the time, check your wechat group. The curious thing about random information is how much is lurking behind it.

In the meantime, I'm trying to figure out, if I or my family were to be infected, and the symptoms showed up a few days later, which hospital would I have to go to? How? How is the route planned? How do you make a complete and effective presentation to your doctor? How do you fight for the chance to be saved?

I created a document to record my and my family's physical symptoms since the 20th, such as a dry cough since the 22nd, slightly aggravated on the 23rd, not excluding the 22nd, moved to two supermarkets, hot and wet down jacket. Wake up in the early morning of the 24th, throat a little swelling and pain, not only itchy, oral honey, slightly improved. Parents'physical condition should be recorded not only in the document, but also in the heart.

Why do some people leave Wuhan? After looking at the Wuhan case from a few other places, I think I have a slight idea. So I said in my family group, if I was infected, I might also drive to Nanjing or Changsha or Guangzhou, stay in Wuhan, medical resources may not be allocated to me.

Actually, I can't drive out of Wuhan Right now. I haven't left my room in 48 hours. My parents and I do not see each other, only calls, New Year's Eve can not pass, reunion dinner naturally did not eat. Mom and dad cooked the meal, I want to give my mom's Bee sanitizer mask, one on the door, one on the door, exchange.

This morning, my mom called to say that she had a sore throat all day yesterday, and after drinking a lot of water, it went away this morning. I was angry with her for not telling me yesterday. I told her at length, "If you have symptoms, I can manage them if they are less severe. I can buy medicine. If you don't tell me, you are 66 years old. If you are out of control, who can I call for help? "

There are many, many people in Wuhan who need help right now.

Talking to my mom on the phone, I realized I was GONNA cry. I suddenly realized that my mother was 66 years old. When did I first become aware of her age? I always thought she was forty, and every picture I took of her was so young. How can I protect my parents?

I mean, we could use a little more outside help, maybe the heroes are on their way, maybe we could all be citizens. But all I can do now is open the file to record the following: Road met Cough Man, the third day, still strong, noon ribs noodles, appetite is OK.

The first patient was reported in December. At that time, I felt that, just like the plague in Beijing at that time, I would tell my family, tell them to be careful, but I didn't know how to avoid it, the overall state of the disease is not entirely clear to us.

Informed friends and family, but did not let them wear a mask, think it is not serious, do not know how to infect, do not have any concept.

Realizing the seriousness, I returned to Wuhan on January 19, and at 11 p.m. , my friends began frantically forwarding me messages, some official, some undetermined.

I haven't been outside since the 20th. And then I told my family not to leave the house. We were supposed to have New Year's Eve dinner after the 20th, and then both grandma and GRANDPA's house and Grandma's house were canceled. Then the house started to be properly ventilated, mopping the floor with disinfectant.

No one I knew directly was infected, but someone I knew indirectly, was a doctor at the hospital, and the doctor got infected, stepped down, and quarantined himself. There is no specific medicine for this disease, just rely on resistance to carry it, carry it over, carry it over, there is no way.

In fact, on the afternoon of January 22, my friend in Beijing sent me a message saying that Wuhan might be closed off. I didn't believe it at the time, because everyone knew that we had never experienced such a thing. I tried to explain it to him. The next day to see the news of the closure of the city, but also not particularly surprised. Or do you think the seriousness of this is suddenly apparent.

My parents didn't want to wear masks when they went out. On the 23rd, the news of the closure of the city was released, and my parents became very nervous. I think the news is quite effective for the middle-aged and elderly people, that is, it will immediately increase their initiative awareness of the disease and enhance their awareness of prevention.

When I got back, I was planning to go to Thailand and change my ticket, but it wasn't that bad.

When things got really bad, I decided not to leave. After all, even my parents are in Wuhan, if I am alone in the field, I will be particularly worried about them.

I haven't been out since the city was closed. My mother went out once, that is, to buy vegetables. The prices of those vegetables in the supermarket that have not gone up by a very large amount have certainly gone up. Many people have tried to grab them, and the supermarket has been robbed of its stock and can not be replenished at once. The streets of Wuhan are now almost empty.

The hardest things to buy were medical supplies and masks, because all my out-of-town friends made me wear masks or sterilize with alcohol. But you can't buy a mask at this point if you don't have a stash of masks or a stash of alcohol, so I'm using the basic blue, air-leaking mask.

Wuhan has no concept of Spring Festival any more. All topics discussed with family and friends are epidemic. Family groups used to send blessings and red envelopes to their elders and friends around the Spring Festival, this year, people just keep retweeting. How do you prevent disease? How do I disinfect my home?

I haven't been outside since the 20th, my house is on the street, the street has been empty since the 22nd, and on the 23rd, the car that cleans the street keeps driving underneath. And there were no pedestrians.

On the 19th, no one on the street was wearing a mask. Then, on the 20th, about 50-50,50-50,50-50,50-50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,5.

At 6:00 the day before yesterday, some grandma and Grandpa were chatting loudly downstairs, because of the epidemic this matter has generated some dispute and discussion, is still very nervous. I saw in those group chats in Wuhan that some young people feel that their situation is not very stable.

I'm not afraid at all, although I can't go on holiday to the place I've been looking forward to for a long time, and the money for travel booking is probably wasted. And estimated that the closure of Wuhan do not know when the end, years after the normal work can not be carried out, it is certainly. I think that's the reality, and when it does, it disrupts the rhythm of your life.

My friend's house is next to the hospital, my mother is also a doctor, orthopedics and gynecology are also scheduled to work. Friends said that the ambulance next to the hospital sound in 20-22 did not break. Because of the new outbreak of disease, medical resources are scarce, a relative of my family just finished surgery, complications pneumonia has also entered the ICU, ill at the wrong time. I talked with my friends all day and felt angry. We don't seem to have enough supplies. The frontline doctors are working hard.

On New Year's Eve I heard someone screaming down there early in the morning and woke up about six o'clock. And I found out that an old lady in the neighborhood had collapsed. I've been talking to friends who've been comforting me ever since. I can't think of anything else to do.

The morning to eat beef noodles (beef less) , afternoon want to go out to buy food to give up. Then a person in the room on the New Year, ready to play a game with friends to relax.

Settled in Wuhan two years ago

I had planned to drive back to my hometown with friends early on the morning of the 24th. The News of the closure of the city came too suddenly. The passage leaving Wuhan at 10 a.m. on the 23rd was all closed. I only saw the news in my friend circle around 8 a.m. that day, i just got out of bed. I couldn't believe it. I waited to call my friends. We decided not to go back this year, even though the highway was not completely closed at that time.

I went to college in Wuhan and worked in Beijing for seven or eight years after graduation. Two years ago I had a child and moved to Wuhan. I have deep feelings for Wuhan and fully understand the matter of sealing off the city, and I have seen academician Zhong Nanshan say on the news before that this epidemic has already resulted in human to human transmission. In the big picture, we can make a little sacrifice.

I live just a few kilometers away from the south China Seafood Market. The News said that it might be the source of the outbreak. On the morning of the city closure, I saw Meituan and Hema Xiansheng preparing to place an order, i found that vegetables, fruits and pork were almost sold out, so I had to go out to a nearby supermarket.

I had just bought a generic surgical mask, and I went out the other day and wore two of them, covered them up. Wuhan recently very cold, sporadic pedestrians mostly wearing masks curled up body, of course, occasionally can see a few people do not wear masks.

There were so many people in that supermarket that there was a long line at every checkout aisle. The supply of goods in the supermarket was normal that morning. There was no shortage of goods and no obvious increase in prices. I bought food -- Rice, vegetables, fruit, PORK -- and a box of farmer's springs and 20 boxes of instant noodles, which felt like déjà Vu in a movie.

Wuhan confirmed the number of people are increasing every day, now everyone does not go out, probably only the supermarket and the hospital more people.

My wife took the kids home a week ago because of the Hukou problem, but I didn't expect the situation to change so quickly. This morning she sent me a home to buy a photo of New Year's Eve, so big for the first time did not go home for the new year, really feel bad.

A person's New Year's Eve, dinner I eat simple, a dish of shrimp, a bowl of rice, a glass of wine is all. Then, I made a video call with my family and told them to take care of themselves and put on a mask when they went out.

I had planned to drive back to my hometown with friends early on the morning of the 24th. The News of the closure of the city came too suddenly. The passage leaving Wuhan at 10 a.m. on the 23rd was all closed. I only saw the news in my friend circle around 8 a.m. that day, i just got out of bed. I couldn't believe it. I waited to call my friends. We decided not to go back this year, even though the highway was not completely closed at that time.

I went to college in Wuhan and worked in Beijing for seven or eight years after graduation. Two years ago I had a child and moved to Wuhan. I have deep feelings for Wuhan and fully understand the matter of sealing off the city, and I have seen academician Zhong Nanshan say on the news before that this epidemic has already resulted in human to human transmission. In the big picture, we can make a little sacrifice.

I live just a few kilometers away from the south China Seafood Market. The News said that it might be the source of the outbreak. On the morning of the city closure, I saw Meituan and Hema Xiansheng preparing to place an order, i found that vegetables, fruits and pork were almost sold out, so I had to go out to a nearby supermarket.

I had just bought a generic surgical mask, and I went out the other day and wore two of them, covered them up. Wuhan recently very cold, sporadic pedestrians mostly wearing masks curled up body, of course, occasionally can see a few people do not wear masks.

There were so many people in that supermarket that there was a long line at every checkout aisle. The supply of goods in the supermarket was normal that morning. There was no shortage of goods and no obvious increase in prices. I bought food -- Rice, vegetables, fruit, PORK -- and a box of farmer's springs and 20 boxes of instant noodles, which felt like déjà Vu in a movie.

A high school classmate sent me a message of condolence on New Year's Eve, which reminded me of many years ago, when I was a freshman at Ensch high school in 2003, I was in SARS, some students went over the courtyard wall to buy, I asked someone to bring me a T-sleeve, a dozen dollars, especially poor quality wear two days on the ball. Roommate, the high school classmate, had a small sleeve and sold it to me at a discount. When I told him about it, he couldn't remember it.

Narrator: Happy New Year

Back in December, we had a feeling the virus wasn't too serious. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, some people began to stock up on Radix Isatidis, face masks, cotton clear, oral liquid and so on on January 10.

I returned to Wuhan on January 17, and my family started talking about it, but it wasn't that serious at the time. It's not uncommon to go shopping, or to go out, on January 18th, when there are a few scattered people wearing masks. But when people talk about it, they don't think it's as bad as it sounds around them.

When I returned to Jingzhou from Wuhan on January 19, I was still very conscious to wear a mask. By then, the south China seafood market had been closed, and the Hankou Railway Station was next door. But there weren't too many people wearing masks at the train station that day, and I was one of the ones who was really nervous.

Later, when academician Zhong Nanshan announced in the news that people could be passed on from one person to another, public opinion became more and more serious, and the Wuhan side, including my parents, relatives and friends, began to attach importance to this matter. Before Wuhan People Oneself also in make fun of, did not take this matter very seriously.

After this was confirmed, our family reunion dinner was canceled. My mother was in all kinds of groups, traveling groups, square dancing groups all had publicity. One aunt called for the family reunion dinner to be returned. My family has also returned hotel and plane tickets to various places.

Our friends around the diagnosis or infection, we know Wuhan residents are very conscious. We don't go to people's houses. We don't let people into our houses. It's basically what everyone I know in my family and friends does. Then I know the relatives and friends did not flee Wuhan.

When we heard that Wuhan was getting worse, we thought about taking a car out, but with the news pouring in, we decided to stay home and be safe.

At that time said that when the city closed, also discussed whether to drive out of the city, but in the end decided unanimously to stay in Wuhan. Many native-born Wuhan people, are a very large family, dozens of people. The News said it would guarantee the electricity, water and gas consumption of Wuhan residents, including food and vegetables. To be honest, our families are not panicking.

Feeling some supermarkets, vegetable markets, Huimin supermarkets, also did not rise in price, Yongwang supermarket for a period of time, but those kinds of dishes are expensive, even if there is no epidemic, the price will rise every new year. Douyin uploaded some of the expensive dishes, in fact, is a clean or boutique dishes, already expensive.

But also does not rule out some people to bid up, the unscrupulous businessman always has. As Wuhan people, it is very angry, some netizens and not in Wuhan, but like to put some negative information unlimited amplification, we feel that Wuhan is not to power. We were sealed off in a city under siege, and if the bad press gets out, people will panic. Originally this supermarket did not happen to rob, because there are users retweeted, we go to the supermarket to rob, this will only increase our panic.

I have a personal experience. Some people say that cabbages in Wuhan cost 70 yuan a piece and 100 yuan a piece. I attach the real price receipt of things to his Weibo. Many netizens in Wuhan do the same.

Someone asked Wuhan people what is the biggest problem, we comment is now Wuhan is most afraid of rumors or false reports. To create this kind of scandal, or to make this kind of false statement, which makes everyone panic, is the worst evil to Wuhan.

At home, we really only have to watch TV and watch mobile phones. Originally, our relatives lived just a block away from us. We didn't go to their homes, we didn't let them come to our homes, and we didn't play Mahjong, just in case there's an increased risk of getting the virus out the door.

Now life has been very boring, at home is eat sleep, sleep eat. I just wish there were less bad news or false news on the Internet.

The streets are almost empty now, empty, and everyone wears a mask. On the morning of New Year's Eve, the community came to our house to hand out the citizens'proposal. It is also false to say that we are not afraid, but we still believe in the government and believe in the party. I hope we people in Wuhan can get through this difficult time.

Migrant workers in Wuhan

I came to Wuhan in 2017, is Henan Jiaozuo People, currently living in Swan Lake Avenue here, is a factory staff.

I didn't get the news that the first chart appeared on December 10th, and my colleagues didn't know about it. I know the news is also a colleague told me, is in December 25, there was a large-scale pneumonia in Wuhan.

My kids go to school here, and if a student has a fever or a cold, they go for treatment, but the school isn't closed, it's still in session. I wear clean clothes and disinfect my hands in the factory.

On December 25, a colleague or friend sent out screenshots of the group, but no official word was received. We don't really care, because it's not official, it's just gossip. On New Year's Day, I took my family out wearing masks. On New Year's Day, I saw very few people wearing masks on the banks of the Yangtze River. Basically, people in Wuhan didn't pay much attention to these things. Then, on January 8th, the school closed, the school broke up on the 15th, and there were no large numbers of people wearing masks when picking up the children.

The serious thing is that on the 19th, the authorities have sent out a message, saying that this is a very serious condition, with a large number of sources of infection. One after the other. I think they're wearing masks.

On the afternoon of the 19th, our factory began to have a holiday, and I stayed at home to keep an eye on the situation. I am now a person in Wuhan Chinese New Year, also do not want to give the family members and the old family brought illness hidden danger.

I went out on the 20th to buy a lot of instant noodles, to stock up on food for myself, and to the local market, but few people wear masks. I wear two layers of mask, one inside, one outside.

I was driving around yesterday, trying to stock up on more masks. Went to a couple of pharmacies, the first three were sold out last Friday, the fourth one, 15 bucks a pop. At this time Wuhan is the traffic, very few people out of the activities, basically put on a mask. The supermarket food is still sufficient, the thing is also quite many, has not snapped up this situation.

New Year's Eve at home alone, can only be to see a movie, see the New Year's Eve party.

I am more rational about the spread of the new virus, because I understand that the disease is human-to-human transmission, so as long as I do not contact people, it should not be too big problem, of course, protection is inevitable. What really worries me is that the new hospital is not far from here.

On January 21, having been away from home for half a year, I boarded the G527 train from Beijing and hurried back to my hometown in Wuhan. I asked my family about the outbreak in Wuhan before I left, and got the reply: Everything is as usual here, not as serious as the outside propaganda.

When I got out of the car, what I saw seemed to confirm what my family had told me. Less than half of the people who came and went wore masks. "It's just a normal Spring Festival, " I thought, as I pulled on my mask and lugged a heavy suitcase through the crowd to get home.

Reports continued to pour in, and more and more cases of infection in other provinces made me think it was more than just a case of flu. The cumulative death toll only increased my suspicions until the news of the closure of Wuhan.

Like everyone else, I was immediately nervous and rushed to a nearby pharmacy to try to stock up on face masks, and there was a long line of them. Many people are Chengdou buy, originally only want to buy masks, see others buy medical alcohol oneself also took alcohol, see others buy cold medicine oneself also buy cold medicine, lost reason, also have no judgment.

Masks are sold only over the counter, at $25 each, and each person is limited to five. The girl behind the counter said, "XX county sells the same mask for 35 yuan, but our boss won't let the price go up to 25 yuan. "

I asked if it was an N95, and the cashier pointed to the "filter: N95" printed in the upper right corner of the package and told him it was a genuine N95. When I got home, I saw the "filter rate 99" on the package. I was suspicious again. I went to JD.com and checked the price of the same type of mask. The price is 150 yuan for 100 masks. "there is better than no. " I finally chose to swallow it.

At this time of year, few people began to walk in the busy streets, and nearly everyone wore masks. The Vegetable Market Wharf, the bus station, also the subway station are all sealed off, even the large-scale shopping mall also has few traces of walking. And now Wuhan residents of the only way to travel by car, in order to deal with the emergency gas stations are also in normal operation.

Now, the entire Wuhan people are aware of the seriousness of the incident, I also accept the reality slowly come over.

Ever since I got home, I've been holed up at home, afraid to go out, except to watch TV or watch the news. I can often get SMS notifications about the Wuhan Epidemic. The CHENGGUAN are now on the front line, sterilizing the streets. Government and government agencies are involved in advertising everywhere, not allowed to go out to visit relatives and friends. I also canceled the party plans, plans to visit relatives and friends have been canceled or refused on the phone.

Privately, I've heard that people in Wuhan can still get out of the city by the back roads, and there are private cars at the moment, charging nearly 1,500 a person. It would have been better if we had blocked off the traffic, at least we wouldn't be stuck here. I still hope that Wuhan will be unsealed as soon as possible, after all, I have to return to Beijing to work.

On This Day, the family did not prepare the New Year's Eve dinner, but simply prepared some home-cooked dishes. After eating, the family quietly gathered around the TV set, perhaps more than the singing and dancing show, the latest development of the Wuhan epidemic can stir our hearts that the string of collapse.

"Happy New Year! " As usual, I received a lot of New Year wishes from friends and relatives, a few simple greetings will be "to go out as little as possible, " "to protect themselves, " and so on. Looking out of the window, the Long Street, only a handful of pedestrians, through the mask who do not recognize who, cloudy cold winter over Wuhan, fireworks rare many. The kids are hiding, too.
