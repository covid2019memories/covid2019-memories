"Winter is coming" is a family language designed by George Martin for the northern list of A Song of Ice and Fire characters in "a song of ice and fire. " It has strong prophetic symbols.

The night and the winter, extreme seasons in this elevated fantasy world, coincided with cold, and with the frequent invasion of creatures known as White Walkers, the seven kingdoms of Westeros instituted the night's watch, relying on outcasts to keep watch, early Warning of fragile peace within borders.

Although the series ended badly, HBO did a pretty good job of presenting the spectacle we read about in the books, starting with the night's Watch's point of view, it ends with snow banished back to the outer rim, and remains an object.

In fact, the name Jon Snow was coined by a 19th century English anesthesiologist who, during the cholera epidemic, relied on medical experience and logical reasoning to conclude that the disease was water borne.

London's Sanitation Department and Water Utility companies have all denied the claims of the Igor, it wasn't until snow mapped the distribution of the patients and pumps as if they were almost identical, that communities began to take notice, and the wells were sealed off, halting the spread of the plague.

Later, when the medical community evaluated snow's contribution, it was generally believed that his attribution method was of great value. Snow did not know what the bacteria causing cholera was until the end, and he did not have the expertise in this field, but based on real survey data and a rational analytical framework, he was able to come up with countless accurate answers to save lives.

This reminds me of the eight Wuhan doctors who first revealed the new type of pneumonia. Even now, some people still accuse them cruelly of not being accurate enough and not being perfect victims, just as in 19th-century England, Dr Snow was accused of being an amateur and unfit to direct the municipal authorities against cholera.

The whistle blows early, and those who don't take it seriously end up with thousands of innocent people, burdened with unspeakable consequences that no amount of hate can overturn.

The term night's watch was first coined by the Adam Smith, who believed that it was the government's duty to act as a night's watch, providing security during the night when citizens slept in safety, as well as during the day.

Of course, the Adam Smith is not an advocate of government omnipotence. The so-called "invisible hand" is actually a derivative of the function of the night's watch. Naturally, those who are concerned about the government are not able to accept being wronged behind the scenes.

It's just that, beyond counting or viewing, we have to ask ourselves how we can, once again, design a system that keeps the nightwatcher awake, at a price that is so costly, and yet growing.

You can't let someone who's willing to do whatever it takes be the price.

Pericles once said, "the man who evades political life in a free city is not quiet, but waste. "

This is my diary of the siege of Wuhan, the 12th day.
