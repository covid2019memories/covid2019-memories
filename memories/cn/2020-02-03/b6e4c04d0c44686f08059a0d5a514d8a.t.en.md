Earlier, the State Council issued a notice to extend the Lunar New Year holiday to February 2, the first working day after the holiday. In order to reduce the crowd to gather, prevent cross-infection, many Internet enterprises choose February 3 to February 7 to let the employee work from home.

"Work from home" although as early as the 1980s in Silicon Valley popular, but has been tepid in China, after the epidemic, this way will be a flash in the PAN, or is it likely to become the mainstream way of the future business office?

A number of interviewees told Rencaijing that after the SARS epidemic in 2003, e-commerce companies such as Alibaba and Jd.com rose up with the wind. This time, the nationwide battle against the epidemic may force enterprises to adopt digital and mobile office methods, take tencent, Alibaba and BYTEDANCE, which made office software freely available during the outbreak, for example. The new moves by these companies are expected to spur explosive growth in the telecommuting industry and drive the market up against the trend.

However, at present, "work from home" collaboration software is mainly divided into Communication Im, document collaboration, video conference / interview, Task Management Four main categories, many with a single product ability, how to integrate collaboration is a problem, in addition, how To protect data privacy is the most important issue for enterprise users.

As important as the epidemic is for managers and employees on a larger scale, the challenge is how to use remote collaboration tools to effectively "work from home" in a society where rework is largely delayed.

"Quanmin Soho" under epidemic situation

Working from Home, known abroad as Small Office (Home Office) , was once a fashionable concept.

As early as the 1980s, IBM began to set up "remote workstations" in employees' homes. About 40 percent of IBM's employees in the mid to late 2017 period were working in Soho. After IBM, silicon valley giants like Google, Facebook and Yahoo joined Soho. Companies are saving money and freeing their workers, a way of doing business that is becoming increasingly popular around the world.

The 2020 pneumonia epidemic has also made Soho a passive but realistic choice for many businesses, especially Internet companies. The state-mandated holiday will be extended until February 2, with local authorities successively issuing notice to delay the resumption of work, and Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Beijing issuing notice one after another requiring all enterprises to start work on February 10, except for essential industries.

At present, the self-isolated office has become the best solution for both enterprises and employees, and new opportunities have opened up for domestic companies that provide services to "work from home" .

There are four main types of telecommuting software on the market: Communication Im, document collaboration, videoconferencing / interviewing, and task management. Some companies are based on existing products, during the outbreak of "work from home" launched a number of new functions, specifically to upgrade the original function, online health-related plate, free open-oriented.

New Opportunities will open up for segmentation

Home Office has long been seen as an ancillary function, but can it be used as an opportunity to break out in the face of the epidemic?

Sun Mengzi, an analyst at Analysys, told Caijing that the 2020 outbreak of the new coronavirus, which forces companies to work from home in the short term, will push the entire telecommuting industry to a deeper level in the long term.

The first is the epidemic of forced to work from home businesses, began to rethink the importance of digital. Most Industries now have a certain digital foundation, after the epidemic, business owners will accelerate the pace of digital transformation, rising water, digital services to B downstream enterprises will usher in rapid growth.

The second wave of opportunities is in the various mainstream subdivisions of the co-working landscape.

A collaborative product responsible for financial said, the current domestic cloud collaboration products, many with a single product capability, such as the document function or audio-video conference function, or a separate IM function.

Liang Gongjun, founder of qunxing technology, a 30 person start up that launched Haina's video interview, told CNNMONEY that the company currently uses several apps to work from home, internal and customer communication is done primarily through wechat and enterprise Wechat, with working documents placed on online tools such as Tower, Teambition, and graphite documents.

Enterprise telecommuting is based on multiple work scenarios, such as instant messaging, collaborative document, online meeting, cloud, customer management, contract management, employee training, etc. .

Sun said there would be a huge market behind any niche application scenario in the industry, drawing in dozens of vendors to provide the tools to support the various operational scenarios of the Enterprise. After this "window period" , each Subarea of collaborative office will present a relatively clear competitive pattern. "but also won't resemble consumptive Internet, form the pattern that big two eats the whole world, old three old four old five drink soup, old five later all die. " Liang Gongjun describes.

"during the outbreak, the main thing for users to choose is who can really help them improve their productivity at work, " Liu Congli, head of the graphite document market, told CAIJING. It is not yet possible to predict whether new users will be able to stay, in addition to the product itself, retention is also related to the use of the scenario, from the telecommuting back to the office to work together, the use of habits, business owners will affect the decision to stay or go.

When the immediate "pain point" of business owners is resolved, the third wave of opportunities in business hiring.

Especially for the small and medium enterprises, the problem of difficult and costly hiring will become more serious this year, and the need for flexible employment will increase significantly for business owners, Sun said, for enterprises to provide flexible employment, on-demand employment solutions will be high-speed development. This will accelerate the breakdown of traditional employment relationships, as companies begin to shift from employment to partnership.

"Data Privacy" is the biggest pain point

While local business owners have had to join the customer list for co-working software, there is still a battle to be fought for telecommuters.

In 2018, Chinese enterprises invested 46 percent in building and developing mobile applications, 20 percent in mobile office-related services, 20 percent in other areas, and only 14 percent in mobile security, according to the forward Industry Research Institute, information Security Investment is a little insufficient, the information security construction of mobile application is still the most important.

Liang, who is also the founder of Taiji capital, believes that data privacy protection is the core concern of enterprise users.

Graphite began to commercialize its B terminal last year, focusing on the pain points of enterprise users using remote collaboration software.

The first is security. Liu Congli introduced the graphite document in three key links to do the work. In terms of storage, users'data are saved to the alibaba cloud, and if the client's industry is in dire need of secrecy, they can also choose to have a customized version of the data deployed on their own servers; at the grassroots level, from files and folders to team spaces (similar to the enterprise cloud) , each layer can be set with different permissions, opening up from top to bottom for ease of enterprise management; Graphite documents set up a special one-click transfer file ownership of the function, to avoid the embarrassment of document leakage.

For the security issue, foreign countries have another set of mature ideas.

Edward, a Silicon Valley engineer, told CNBC that domestic companies are more focused on the concept of the intranet, but the danger is that if the intranet is compromised, it means the intruder can gain a lot of extra access, in order to ensure security, companies need to put a lot of effort to ensure that the internal network is not hacked, even so, the risk is still there, the general large companies have thousands of computers, there is no guarantee that the problem.

At present, the latest thinking abroad is to eliminate the internal office network, put all the core resources on the cloud, employees can access at home, can access within the company, access rights are no longer differentiated by the network environment, it's the process of authenticating the user. The premise, of course, is that companies need to ensure that all data is traceable and auditable. For example, if an employee accesses a company's resources at home, the company needs to be able to trace the breach back to its source.

While Google APPS, Office 365 and Slack are some of the most popular online collaboration software in Silicon Valley, Edward added, for instant messaging, many big companies are banning such Apps from outside and developing their own tools, such as Hangouts, microsoft uses Microsoft Teams and so on.

Working from home is also a risk in the United States. Edward Said many people who work in the United States are on American visas and are not legally allowed to work from home. A work visa specifies that you must work at a specific place and time, although the company will try to avoid inadvertent violations of these rules.

Then there is the integration problem. In the fully competitive market environment, product homogenization is the industry around the problem. Liu Cong Li said that many enterprises have their own OA system, all hope that the foreign software can be integrated into their own OA system, easy to use staff one-stop, do not have to switch back and forth.

For integration, Zhang Guojun, executive vice president of EITHER/OR, offers the same advice. The market is not a zero sum game, and many OA systems still use generic software, online collaboration tools can be specialized and customized to do the existing OA's "partner. ".

According to Zhang, large enterprises are more technologically advanced and ecologically integrated, and need to pay more attention to the user experience and needs of small organizations; small enterprises are more distinctive and need to have stronger expansibility and strengthen the connection with commercial software.

Many people in the industry said that telecommuting will become a big trend, affected by the epidemic, large and small businesses in the industry have the opportunity, but for a long time, telecommuting is only as a supplement to centralized office, will not become mainstream.

How to promote work from home?

Whether you can work from home is most affected by the type of industry.

On February 2, in response to the impact of the epidemic on the post-holiday resumption of work and other aspects, the results of a survey conducted by Zhaopin showed that Internet companies accounted for the highest proportion of home-based work among all industries, the highest proportion of enterprises adopting telecommuting was 32.1% for IT / communications / Electronics / Internet, followed by 28.3% for business services.

In response, Liang said that Internet related industries such as Internet engineers, editors and journalists, marketing, sales, and creative industries such as design, as well as lawyers, are suitable for knowledge worker. Sun Mengzi believes that the industry suitable for working from home must be one with a high degree of digitalization, such as industries with relatively mature online business processes such as the Internet of Science and Technology, information technology and media, because in the enterprise has the strong substitution, the strong document sex or the strong standard work content, is easy to be carried on the line.

So, how does it work from home?

An employee at an internet giant told CNFC that he had been told to work from home from February 3 to 10. He had been telecommuting for a year, and from the employee's perspective, he thought it would save time, but the leader would have a different idea. His leadership repeatedly said that face-to-face communication is more efficient, for some important events, he was asked to travel face-to-face report, usually also asked to write daily, weekly, the progress of each work will be strictly "monitored" to control progress.

The management and the communication efficiency, are the enterprise manager most do not rest assured two questions.

Liang Gongjun suggested that business managers, first of all, work from home to strengthen regular communication, to a certain meeting system to ensure the frequency and efficiency of communication. If is to the staff behavior standard / The work flow control strict team, may use the nail, the enterprise wechat. Second, be sure to break down the goals into tasks, break down the company's goals for a period of time into daily, specific to people, specific to hours for each task, and specific to the norms and requirements of the submission.

Sun suggests that managers use online collaboration tools more often. Before the outbreak, the remote software on the market could already meet the needs of the vast majority of enterprises, but it was not fully utilized. Many enterprises used wechat and nail, it's mostly about control, like attendance, rather than synergy. She recommends that business owners learn more about telecommuting software and replace the processes that can be moved online with online solutions.

In addition, Sun Mengzi described the epidemic during the easy-to-see response strategy for business managers reference. On the one hand, at the strategic level, executives break down tasks into departments, then solidify the process according to business objectives, document it, and distribute it throughout the company. On the other hand, the "AB role" system was initiated in response to the epidemic. All internal employees were divided into a or B roles, that is to say, the same position, corresponding to backup two employees, A and B work content and progress simultaneously every day, and take turns to work, a 3-day shift and B 3-day shift to reduce the risk of infection. Normally, A and B work together, quickly enabling one role in case of a problem.

Working from home allows flexibility and saves commuting time, but it's not without its drawbacks, such as inefficient communication, a low sense of belonging and a great test of willpower. Yahoo was on its last legs, and the first thing CEO  Malisa Longo Mayel did when she took over was to get all of Yahoo's employees back to work instead of working from home.

Here are a few things you should be aware of if you want to get to work quickly:

First, form a routine. Working from home, for companies, is a test of the ability to break down goals into tasks, and for employees, it is a test of the ability to distinguish between work and rest. For example, you can create a daily schedule, set a time to do your work, and clearly distinguish between work and rest, so that you can be productive and have a balance between work and rest.

Second, don't work in a rest area. It's important, Edward says, that you really have to have a room at home for yourself that you can work in, and then no one can come in and disturb you while you're at work, separating your work environment from your living environment.

Third, find ways to pair tools, such as management by objectives for yourself, with co working software.
