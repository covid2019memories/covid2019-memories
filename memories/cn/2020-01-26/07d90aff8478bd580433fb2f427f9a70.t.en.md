Originally in the last program before the Spring Festival, I predicted that the story FM will be a week off, see you back after the festival.

But this Spring Festival, AH, our team are not interested in the New Year, we are most concerned about the status of friends in Wuhan and the surrounding epidemic areas now. Because although all sorts of news is flying in the friend circle, but which is true and which is false very difficult to judge. So today, as soon as our team put it all together, we started contacting our friends in Wuhan and asking them to tell us what the real experience and difficulties are.

The owner of the "screenplay" board game store is five months pregnant

As I recall, in early January, we heard rumors that there was a very serious outbreak of influenza in Wuhan. But then the government did a rumor, let everyone do not worry, we also did not pay attention to the store business is still thriving.

We were open until January 20th or so. At that time, although the staff in the shop would wear masks to work, and would also remind the players, but the public really did not have the slightest vigilance, when playing in the shop, no one wore masks, and I don't think there's anything wrong with being around so many people.

It wasn't until January 22, when we heard about a death, that we realized the scale of the problem. From that day on, places like ours were closed.

On that day, I found that our couple's body temperature is a little high, so not at ease, decided to find a designated hospital for a look.

On the night of January 23, we went to Tongji Guanggu Hospital district. The hospital is one of the designated hospitals in Wuhan, far from the city center. We chose this place because we saw on the Internet that all the hospitals in the city center were full, and we were worried that we would get sick if we went there.

When I arrived at the hospital, I found that the flow of people in the hospital is really not much. While entering the hospital, I noticed that the security guard on duty only wore a mask. The hospital was still doing some emergency construction and defense. I don't know if it was for some related work in the back. All the construction workers were wearing masks.

At first, we were in the wrong room with a fever. There are about 30 patients out there, some hanging water, some running blood tests. There was an ambulance parked nearby, and several of the workers near the ambulance were armed and wearing protective clothing.

After fever, we went to the emergency department. Only two or three of the emergency room staff were in full protective clothing when triage was done. The other staff were not fully protected.

We'll check in when we get there, and then we'll do the triage at the triage desk. Throughout the registration process, we probably encountered more than 20 patients, most of them are to hang fever this department, said he had temperature abnormalities.

Their unified operation is to give you a thermometer, let you in the side to take a temperature self-test. If the temperature is not high enough to reach a definite high, the doctor will ask if you want to take the next step. If there are no complications, the doctor will advise you to go home.

After taking the measurements, my temperature was normal, while my husband's temperature was 37.4 degrees, just above the threshold. The doctor looked at his condition and advised him to go to the Fifth Hospital in Wuhan for a test. He said, their hospital only admitted confirmed patients, according to my husband's condition, if stay to do tests, but there is a risk of infection. At the same time, I noticed that many patients on the scene had received such advice. However, the problem was that the hospital did not have a special isolation van to take patients to the hospital for referral. The next day, public transportation in Wuhan was already suspended, the patient becomes less able to see the patient.

From what I observed in this hospital, at that time, the burden of medical resources in Wuhan was already heavy. It was around 8 p.m. when we arrived, and the hospital's medical team of fewer than 10 people had to deal with more than 30 confirmed patients and deal with new ones. And this hospital belongs to the third-class Hospital, in Wuhan is already a very high-level hospital, but in this case, we also feel that they can not spare too many people in the process of night treatment.

Later, when we considered the risk of cross-infection, we didn't go to another hospital, but went home to observe. So far, we're all in good shape.

Actually, my biggest personal concern is what to do with the rest of my pregnancy. Soon, in mid-february, I will go to the hospital for a related prenatal examination, that is to say, I will go to the hospital anyway. And in this process, as Wuhan Motor vehicles have been restricted travel, I went to the hospital as a pregnant woman is extremely inconvenient. Not only that, during the rest of the pregnancy, up until the time I gave birth, the outbreak created too much uncertainty for me and my baby's health.

On top of that, I'm a little concerned that we can't predict how long the epidemic will last. But before it ends, Wuhan's all management behavior is has no way normal operation. In the meantime, I have to pay the rent on the storefront, but I don't have any income, and I don't know how long the economy will last. My biggest concern is that such a long-term situation, there will be some people's excessive emotion and excessive behavior, bringing security risks.

Besides, we don't want to see too many rumors. Those rumors are very stressful for us in Wuhan, such as the kind of people who died on the road, died in the hospital, and so on. From what I've seen, despite the pressures on Wuhan's health care system, it's relatively out of control. We don't want to create more panic for those who are still in quarantine, otherwise there is no way to face this disaster.

Yeva,@wuchang, Wuhan

Student, lives with his father and uncle

■ Wuhan, Jan. 21

I am 21 years old and have lived in Wuhan for 21 years. Although I am not registered in Wuhan, I am already a resident of Wuhan.

I didn't go to bed until 2:00 yesterday. I woke up at 11:00 today. When I woke up, my uncle asked me to cook for my dad because he was sick and had to go to the hospital, so I started cooking for him at 12:00.

When my dad got home, he took off his mask, and I said to him, "sterilize your jacket. "

He won't. Says he wants to sit down.

I said, "you just got back from the hospital, and you have something on your shirt that needs to be disinfected. "

He thought I was being mean to him, and he got into a fight with me, and he said, "I'm starving, and you're not cooking, so you tell me to sterilize. "

I said, "I'm already doing it for you. "

Because my dad's job is in a very crowded place, and I called him up on the 19th or so, and I said, "it's getting kind of serious out there, and you need to put your mask on. "

But he said, "No, how does it work? How do you communicate with people? What will people think when they see me in a mask? "

On the night of the 22nd, he suddenly told me he had a cold. The doctor said he was allowed to rest at home because he wasn't sure if COVID-19 was causing the pneumonia.

And I said to him, "well, don't come back to me, just come back to you. I was afraid he would come straight up, so I went to live with a friend.

I came back the next day. We wanted to leave for our hometown on the 24th, but when we heard that the city would be closed, we wanted to see if we could leave early. But on the way, we had another big fight, and he said he wouldn't leave.

I asked my dad, "do you know what's going on out there? "

"right now this thing is just a little bit better than the flu, " he said. "

I said, "is this stronger? A lot of people have been infected, highly infectious! "

Then he said, "but do you know who those people are? Those who are seriously ill are old people. Nothing can happen to the young and middle-aged. "

I told him, "the medical care in Wuhan is broken now, " but he still thought I was making a mountain out of a molehill.

I was really devastated the other day. On the 22nd, the night before the city was closed, my mother, who had already returned home, called me and said, "don't come back. Just stay in Wuhan. Don't come back. " And we won't see you when we get back. "

I don't know what to say.

My Dad had a shot the night of the 22nd, which brought his fever down, and then on the 24th, New Year's Eve, he was asymptomatic. Just at dinner, he said he felt a little dizzy and his limbs were sore, but he didn't cough much.

■ On the night of Jan. 25, Yeva went out to buy a face mask, and you can see a lot of cars around the supermarket

I don't know what's GonNa Happen in the future, but if it's like this, maybe it'll go away. But if it gets worse, I don't know what I'm GONNA do.

It was supposed to be a home quarantine, but I found one very important problem: The pharmacy outside had closed, if I wanted to buy medicine, I had to go to the hospital, but now the situation inside the hospital is very serious.

I have a friend whose father has basically been diagnosed with pneumonia, but he is still quarantined at home. The family had dined together the day before his father was diagnosed, after his father said he had a common cold.

Parents'sense of control is really weak.

My Body, as I know it, hasn't been very well this year, so I'm afraid to go to Florida, in case I get sick, I don't know if I'm going to make it to the Little Tangshan Project.

I don't know what I would do if my father's condition worsened, and now the buses are paralyzed, and I can't drive, and I don't know how to get him to the hospital.

Li Bo, editor,@jiangxia district, Wuhan

My name is Li Bo. Today is January 25,2020. On the first day of the New Year, I am in Jiangxia District, Wuhan. It has been raining in Wuhan, and it has been a bit cold in recent days.

I'm from Liaoning Province and lived in Beijing until last August. My girlfriend was working in Beijing, but for various reasons her parents forced her back to Wuhan.

Because I didn't want to be away from home, and I'm a studio editor by profession, so I came here to work from home. I abandoned Beijing for love, and I don't want my parents in Beijing.

I am alone now, because I haven't known her for a long time, so she went back to spend the holidays with her family, and now I have no choice but to leave myself.

This Spring Festival, in fact, I first bought a ticket to Beijing on the morning of New Year's Eve. I remember things took a turn for the worse, like the 21st. I just wasn't meant to go, because my ticket was for the 23rd.

But on the 22nd, my girlfriend had a cold, and I thought I might be at risk. I was afraid it would affect my parents, so I returned the tickets.

At that time, I was actually a little bit flustered, and I talked to my girlfriend and said, "do you want to go to the hospital with your family and check it out first? ".

She and her family were still in Huangshi, then in Wuhan, where they went to a small hospital. There are a lot of people, the doctor said my girlfriend just a little cough, no fever, may be a little sore throat, so the doctor was sent back quickly.

In retrospect, that was a very unwise choice. Because it's possible to get an infection on the way to the hospital, and theoretically, the whole family should be quarantined, because they've been to the hospital.

■ I saw a delivery guy and I wanted to call him "big brother" Li Bo

I'm home alone with two cats and a robot sweeper, the only four things that move in my house.

I went to the supermarket on the day of the 12th Lunar Month, twenty-eight, and didn't go out for three days. Last night, I think my whole mood is starting to go wrong. I've had a long history of depression and anxiety, and I've been in therapy for five years. So I know that I am a more easily affected by emotions, character is more sensitive person.

There is a psychological term, probably is you brush a lot of the network on those traumatic news, people will be forced to keep their brush, and then very anxious. And I'm alone. I don't have anyone to talk to.

I had a little problem with my work partner yesterday, and I was in a really bad place. In the evening, I had a bad conversation with my girlfriend on the phone. This morning I saw someone sent a psychological article, telling people to pay attention to mental health protection at this time.

So I started this morning with a detailed personal schedule. In addition to daily exercise, today I signed up for my first live voice account. I have never used live broadcast before, tried a few times, although no one to see, but also a small attempt and relief.

I feel like I need to talk to somebody. I need to talk to somebody.

So maybe I should categorize my friends and see who has extra time for me to talk to.

■ when I'm bored, I sort my household items by size. Li Bo

I may go to the supermarket to see if it is still open and replenish my food. I'm not sure what the supermarket around my house looks like yet. Because I went to the supermarket on December twenty-eight and never went out again.

I can't talk about balanced food right now. I have a lot of rice, and my rice keeps me from starving to death. Vegetables, protein, these things, may only be a few days of supply, the next day or after a few days, I must go out to buy things.

I called my friends this morning, and they all told me to stock up on food. I think that the restrictions on the flow of people is no problem, logistics should not be necessary to limit it, the normal supermarket or stock. But that's just my judgment. I don't know if it's accurate.

After all, objectively speaking, given the severity of the outbreak, it could go on for a long time.

The vending machine is still full, giving people a sense of security Li Bo

L and Black,@wuhan Panlong City Economic Development Zone

Today is January 25,2020, my name is l, now at home in Wuhan, since the outbreak of the epidemic, I have not been out of the house, every day can do is in front of the computer, mobile phone, and the two closest people, watching what's going on out there in this environment.

I'm Black, L's fiance.

Undergraduate study in Hubei, graduate students went to Wuhan, Wuhan lived for several years. My girlfriend is in Wuhan. I went home before the outbreak, but my girlfriend is still in Wuhan.

Before the overwhelming online discussion of the severity of the epidemic on January 20, people in Wuhan did not have such a high degree of vigilance, and we were living a normal life and preparing for the New Year. During that time, we often had a spring festival meal.

I went to Chongqing with my colleagues from the 19th to 22nd. Flew in on the 19th, woke up on the 20th, everything was different. Everyone on the phone is talking about Wuhan Pneumonia. From that day on, everyone in Chongqing began to wear masks. On the contrary, the two of us in Wuhan didn't wear masks, which immediately made us feel terrible, because as a Wuhan person who suddenly found himself in Chongqing, you couldn't say where you came from. Once, when we buy things to swipe the membership card, the clerk knew that we are Wuhan people, the look suddenly changed. We find ourselves like the plague.

At that time we also pay close attention to ourselves, often touch the forehead to see if there is a fever. By the time I got back on the night of the 22nd, many flights to Wuhan had been canceled. Thank God our flight's okay. When we got home, the city was sealed off. I'm so, so glad I came back at this hour, or I wouldn't have made it to Wuhan.

I've been in a relationship with her for four years. I graduate this July. We are going to have the wedding after graduation. According to the custom in the north, there will be an engagement party before the formal wedding. We set the time for that on January 30th.

Our engagement party had been planned a long time ago. My parents and I were going to Inner Mongolia on the third day of the Lunar New Year, but due to the closure of the city, all our plans were put off. My fiancé was in a bit of a bind, because engagement is a northern custom, and they're all from their side, so they'll have to deal with a lot more after the cancellation.

In fact, our two families in the development of the epidemic, worried that guests will not mind they are from Wuhan. As a matter of fact, it will. How could it not! I was also worried about how to do, I would like to be done with a stiff upper lip, done as soon as you go back!

But then it got really bad, and if the engagement party goes on, if someone gets infected, it's not gonNA end well.

That's how we think it's GONNA play out.

As a result, the city of Wuhan was sealed off, so there was no need to mention whether to come or not.

We'll have to cancel the engagement party, return the restaurant, the supplies, and notify the guests one by one.

I've only been out twice in that time.

Once, on the second day after returning home from the airport, I took my parents out shopping to buy some face masks, only to find that the pharmacy was completely inaccessible. There was a long line at the checkout counter at the pharmacy, and everyone in Wuhan became especially mysterious because they wore masks. Everyone had a big bag of pills in their hands, and they didn't buy a box or two, they bought a lot of them.

When I go shopping with my mom, we don't talk, we buy our own, and we try to avoid each other. My mom says it feels like I'm starving, and there's food everywhere. I don't know why it's suddenly like this.

And the worst part is, this afternoon, all of a sudden, they're gonNA shut down the roads, they're gonNA block all the cars, they're gonNA go crazy. I took them shopping again, and this time I couldn't even get one. I've been to several supermarkets. They're all closed. There were cars parked in front of every supermarket, and people were already parking on the street, regardless of whether the place could be parked or not.

In the process, we have no idea when the city will be closed, whether there will be no supermarkets to sell in the future, whether there will be insufficient food... We simply can not think about it, all we can think about now is to have enough rice and as many vegetables as possible, fruit, that's pretty much out of the question. We managed to find an open Metro AG, parked in front of the car, almost out of vegetables, bought two bags of rice, and grabbed a lot from the bread section.

I was actually thinking, you know, I have a car, and I could go shopping. Those who don't have a car or have a complicated home environment, even some empty nesters, how should they spend this period?

Honestly, I think I could really use him right now. We spent most of the time together from the time we were getting married. But this time, we are not together.

He is also very concerned about the situation here, every day contact with me, as long as we sent the document, he will be the first time to communicate with me. He was in Inner Mongolia buying US masks, too, though he didn't make it. But I know he's got a lot on his mind. When I talked to him today, he said to me,

As soon as the lockdown is lifted, I'll be back with her.

At this time although we miss each other, but I do not really want him to come back, because it is not safe, or to take care of their own body.

Jiu Jiu, from Wuhan

Advertisement plan with nurse qualification certificate

Today is January 25,2020, the first day of the Lunar New Year. My parents and I are out of town for the New Year.

There were some suspicious pneumonia cases in Wuhan in early January, but at the time it was said that "limited human-to-human transmission" was "preventable and controllable. " We didn't notice, and few people wore masks.

On January 20, news on the Internet began to pour in from all directions, with cases appearing everywhere, pointing to the fact that the virus had come from Wuhan. That was when we began to feel something was wrong.

I couldn't buy a mask at noon, so I took the subway home from work, and the security guard didn't wear one at all. There were a lot of people on the subway, but no one wore them.

In the early morning of January 23, because of the holiday, I was out drinking with my friends. My boyfriend called me out of the blue and said, "Wuhan is closing down the city. You have to go. "

I just realized this problem might be getting out of hand.

Immediately booked the ticket, early in the morning with my parents first by high-speed rail, then by plane, left Wuhan.

I know it's selfish of me to do this, but as someone who has received medical wisdom, I know the magnitude of the problem.

I can't imagine what I'd do if I left my parents here, how I could protect them in the event of an outbreak, without even basic care.

Along the way, I always told my parents to take care of their body temperature and physical condition. Fortunately, the three of us were always in good health. But I did not take it lightly, after all, is still in the incubation period, to the boyfriend's house, we have been self-isolation.

Until yesterday, because my boyfriend had a Migraine, I went to buy him a box of Ibuprofen, in the Registration ID card, I was found in Wuhan.

The quarantine people contacted us today, took our temperature and told us to quarantine ourselves. Of course I would never leave the house again. I didn't want to hurt anyone or cause any trouble.

I know there are a lot of people on the Internet who have a lot of ill will towards people who are fleeing, but if your city is also being attacked by a virus, and the disease starts to spread, you can't not want to go out without a good response, at least it's safer outside than in Wuhan.

Please understand a Wuhan Panic, I love my hometown, love the people there, but I want to protect me and my family.

Every day I look at the new information scrolling on the screen, I feel very sad.

After the city was closed, everything was paralyzed, and according to my friend, there were a lot of old people pushing a scooter or riding a bicycle across the river on the bridge from Wuchang to Hankou. So, what are we gonNA do about the motor vehicle restrictions tomorrow.

My friend said that Wuhan had become an empty city. There was no one on the street. The only sound you could hear was the ambulance.
