Wang Anping checked into the hotel on the 26th

Information About "stranded tourists in Wuhan, Yunnan, unable to return home due to outbreak control and refused to check into hotels and restaurants" has spread on the Internet. In order to prevent and control the epidemic, various provinces have also started to screen foreigners from Wuhan, which is a very extensive and difficult task.

Wang Anping, a Wuhan tourist stranded in Lijiang, is quoted as saying.

Information About "stranded tourists in Wuhan, Yunnan, unable to return home due to outbreak control and refused to check into hotels and restaurants" has spread on the Internet. In order to prevent and control the epidemic, various provinces have also started to screen foreigners from Wuhan, which is a very extensive and difficult task.

Wang Anping, a Wuhan tourist stranded in Lijiang, is quoted as saying.

When we were having dinner yesterday, we heard the tourists talking to us, saying that we had just arrived in Lijiang yesterday, and that all the scenic spots were closed. They won't be staying at the hotel today, but at least they can go home. What about us? To say a bad word, now call a car, some see you are Wuhan phone, Dare Not Answer, serious to this extent.

Yesterday, my friends and I started to find a way to add a group of stranded tourists in Yunnan Province on Wechat. It was pulled by a wuhan-based owner who runs an inn in Lijiang. There are over 200 people inside, most of them tourists coming to Lijiang. Each person behind is two or three people even five or six people's families, so the calculation, covering 1000-2000 Wuhan people.

It's been a chaotic couple of days, with some hotels still available, some people having trouble getting in, some calling the local mayor's hotline, and some places reporting mixed results, some telling us to wait and some telling us to leave Lijiang. A group of friends went to the local People's Hospital yesterday and opened a health certificate. They wondered if there would be such a health certificate? A bunch of friends called 110, and the COPS said it was out of our hands. Some tourists can not stay in Yunnan Province, do everything possible, by train, by plane to leave, to other places, everywhere. We're all in and out of unstable situations.

We did not get a unified official response, there is no unified measures, now is to manage us or ignore us? Proportionally, the vast majority of groups of friends have been pushed out by the hotel in recent days. The group began counting staff and information yesterday and reported it to the Lijiang government, which met to discuss it and appointed the two hotels to co-ordinate. But yesterday, and today? What about tomorrow? We have no idea when we will be able to return to Hubei Province. People like us, who checked out today, are sitting outside the hotel, waiting for the owners to compile today's list, and then talking to the government. We wait for news every day, can not go home, also dare not go elsewhere, very passive.

I left Wuhan on the 19th for Kunming, which was supposed to be my Spring Festival holiday. There was no news of the outbreak at the time, and most of our group, like me, had followed the normal course of travel and could not return. My plane took off on the evening of the 19th, nothing was announced at that time, I took the subway to Tianhe Airport, went to the terminal and entered the security gate, the security staff surrounded a group of people with me and paused for 1-2 minutes, i see an infrared tool on the right. We know more or less that pneumonia and the flu have been bad lately, but that's all we know. And my friend took a taxi to the airport, the arrival is very smooth, also did not take a temperature. Do not feel the situation is serious, but also mistakenly thought that this is the same as every Spring Festival I go out to play. If I had known it was the 20th, I would have stayed home.

Including the 19th, I have been out for eight days, I also with my classmates, friends, colleagues in Wuhan, Wuhan, I know the situation, mild symptoms of people are advised to quarantine themselves at home. They are also calming down at home every day, through online expert counseling. Now Wuhan Three towns between the road traffic is unified by the government, ordinary people have no chance to go out, they are also very scared. But they panicked, and at least there was a quiet room to stay in. We didn't know where to go every day, and we were scared. I'm just as afraid of being infected as anyone else. I don't have any symptoms at the moment, but I'm also afraid that I'm in an incubation period. These days my friends and I wear masks every day and try not to talk to anyone. Most people do. The thing is, everybody's on edge, nobody's freaking out, and once they do, there's no way to fix it. But we are also very cold, on the one hand, as a Hubei, I am very considerate of other people's views and fears, but if the outbreak in Beijing, or Guangdong Province, the local people will not be willing to face such treatment.

Our appeal is very simple, hope to be able to have a good point, to place our part of the people. Since the state calls for staying put, isolating itself, for its own safety and that of others, it is hoped that governments everywhere will heed the call. Second, we get together, and we're afraid that it's highly contagious, and it's only now that we have a unified administration, that it's possible to centralize medical care and equipment to monitor it, and it's even more dangerous if we're scattered. We're all willing to cooperate, but we just don't have an answer or a strategy. We also heard that some landed in Zhengzhou or Xiamen, a landing, the government will be placed and isolation, accommodation by the government unified management. We have a group of people who are in a bad mood and say, "We'd love to get sick and be isolated. At least we'll be supervised. ". Hubei has sacrificed a lot, the whole province has been shut down, and every day I see all kinds of cynicism on the Internet, and I know, I know, but really... (choking up)

I'm not panicking about this, I think we should just do what the authorities say, and panicking isn't going to help. The best thing to do now is to protect yourself from people. My only anxiety was that we didn't have a place to live, and I didn't know whether it would be ten days and a half months or a month or two before we could go home. Like the Lijiang government, they appointed a hotel yesterday, but they didn't tell us how long we could stay, and there was also the issue of cost, $300 a day, which we understand very well, it's cheap during the new year, and they can take us in under such circumstances, we're very grateful. But if it's like this every day of the month, that's just the accommodation, the family, the food, the living. I originally flew back to Wuhan on the 27th, 31 to work, and now definitely not back, do not know how long to stay outside. We can't work or make money right now. How long can we hold out?

I also know that there are a lot of rumors on the Internet, and we don't know which news to believe, so panic is inevitable. My colleague advised us to hurry to Kunming, but Kunming refused and had to move. We are obviously ordinary, uninformed travelling people, now scattered everywhere, if something really happened, 100 mouth I do not know, you will judge me malicious spread, who will listen to me?

After ruling out some information, I forced myself to make a rational and objective choice. I was so anxious, I didn't know where I was going to be tomorrow, if I had a place scheduled for today. I don't know. Leave it right? It's still the right thing to do. Where to go on the train, the train can only guarantee food and shelter, this place can not get off the station to sit somewhere else. But it's not a big deal to be on the move.

Yesterday someone in the group shared the free mutual aid groups in other cities, from Hainan, Guangzhou, Xiamen and Changsha. I believe that there are many places where they are slowly forming groups. Fellow villagers have some good intentions. We have gathered together on the Internet, let's figure out a way to help each other.

I have thought about this question, whether it is possible to find a way for the media of various provinces, cities and localities to reflect our situation, and the relevant departments to properly place our group of people. Yesterday, a group of friends, he said that the words are particularly good, he said, since the advice given by the state is that all the people in the country should be placed in place, listen to the official advice, good disinfection, self-protection, self-isolation do not run amok. Since this initiative, Hubei Province, in the home isolation of that part of the people, the people every day care, greetings, to materials, to find ways to help. If you get sick outside, you'll be quarantined. You can't get sick and people won't care. Our part is very ambiguous, not up and down the people, no one in charge, but in fact this part of the people is also the greatest hidden danger.

We're scattered, we're homeless, each city is a point of dispersal, if we can't centralize, we can't isolate ourselves, you kick me out of this hotel today, I'll have to go to another hotel tomorrow, how much danger is there in the process of moving on the road? It's not gonNA work if you don't keep us together. We don't go anywhere by ourselves. What about the old people, the children, the big families, the pregnant women?

We're all human. It's just these people, they're not your real parents, they're not your siblings. You might not feel that much. We didn't do anything wrong. You want to accept me to accept, can not accept I have no way, I also can cooperate silently, you want to be afraid of me to avoid a bit, everybody is common person, also very kind-hearted, what can we do?

Yesterday told us to cancel these two days, I said yes immediately, only hope these two days have the placement. This morning together, said the relocation of the hotel in response to the government's request to suspend business. So now we have no place to live. A friend told us, do you want to go to Changsha? Go to your relatives there, go to your classmates, we thought about this, because I said I wasn't sure, even if my incubation period was over, and I was sure I was perfectly healthy, we didn't want to bother anyone, the discrimination is too serious now, when I went, I not only affected myself, but probably my family, who had kindly taken me in, and I was quarantined with them, and that was the most basic effect. Not Too much influence, maybe more influence, I may influence others to say that your home Hubei People, the company will not let you come to the door, this example is not my imagination. I have a friend who emigrated to the U.S. , and now there are two confirmed cases in the U.S. , right? He lives in Seattle in the United States, and her in-laws live in Wuhan all the year round, but her in-laws left earlier than I did, and may have already gone to the United States to prepare for the Spring Festival with them in the middle of January 10, now that their Seattle neighborhood knows they have a Hupeh in the family, his sister in Law's American company has simply told them: don't come to work for a while.

I can't be mean to people. What can I do? This will only make other people in Hubei people more bad impression. It is unfair that the fear of the virus at the heart of the problem has turned into fear of the people of Hubei. Who says this virus is called Hubei? Now, to be fair, infected people have already appeared in various provinces and cities, and the infectivity of the virus has also confirmed human-to-human transmission, as well as the spread of the second transmission without passing through Wuhan and Hubei Regions, all over the country there are such hidden dangers of the virus, this hidden danger is not all latent in Hubei people.
