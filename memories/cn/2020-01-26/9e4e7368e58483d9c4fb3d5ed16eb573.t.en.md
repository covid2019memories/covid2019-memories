I regret leaving Wuhan. Since returning to the countryside, the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan has been so heart wrenching that the new year has become Hung Up. Had I known this, I might as well have stayed in Wuhan for the New Year and felt at ease.
The day of the siege, someone on the Internet kept showing off their "escape" from Wuhan, and I thought it was funny. In the face of disease, some people want to leave, some people want to stay; some people are playing the keyboard, some people are quietly doing their part. Life is full of surprises, but it's normal.
I talked to a documentary film producer in Wuhan on the phone last night. He said he would like to go back too. We have a lot in common, and we have a lot in common in documenting society and understanding its complexity. Wuhan closed, we would like to know the situation, but can not get in, we can only do anxious.

It's customary to go home for the New Year, but it has nothing to do with the epidemic. My wife and I boarded the train on the night of January 20(December twenty-six) to return to her hometown in Hunan Province for the Lunar New Year. When we entered Wuchang Railway Station, there was no screening; less than 20 per cent of the passengers in the waiting halls were observed wearing masks.
On the train, my wife and I discussed the outbreak and said that the people of Wuhan were so calm that they didn't even wear masks, but we thought it was normal, as long as no one passed it on, it wouldn't be a big problem.
Unexpectedly, when he returned home early the next morning, Zhong Nanshan was interviewed and confirmed that word had spread. The situation in Wuhan is also rapidly becoming tense and escalating, and epidemic prevention measures are gradually being carried out throughout the country.

The "hard core" epidemic prevention in Henan Province has been well received by public opinion because of its early development and effective measures. But in most parts of the country, epidemic prevention work has been carried out in succession.
The next day (January 21) morning, Fujian Home Village cadres on the contact me, asked me to go home, it seems that the investigation has been launched. But on the night of January 23rd, in the hometown of his wife in Hunan Province, village officials went to the house to check and register.
Village cadres do not know if it is not to offend us, said it is to cope with the task of the next higher level, also did not remind them to go out less and so on.
The in-laws returned home a few days early, and even a few days after our return, they were still busy visiting relatives and buying New Year goods. There was no sense of tension among the masses. After I received the information from my hometown in Fujian, I also lamented that Hunan had not yet rushed to prevent the epidemic.
My wife and I warned my in laws to stay indoors, to isolate ourselves -- not so much from ourselves as from others.
In accordance with the agreement years ago, New Year's Eve, aunts, uncles are with us. On the 29th day of the 12th month, his wife told his parents-in-law, or relatives said clearly, if there is taboo, not together with the New Year.
From the point of view of the in-laws, how to convey the meaning of our family is very delicate.
Of course, they can't just say, don't come, or you'll be shut out, but they can't say what we mean. After all, we're from Wuhan. The next day, everyone gathered together for the New Year.
Think, these are close relatives, even if the heart a little taboo, afraid will not take the initiative to cancel the family reunion. They probably have the same subtleties we do. If I Could Tell You, family, you're welcome.

Originally the first day of the New Year is to two uncle's house party, under our suggestion, New Year's Eve, mother-in-law still called uncle, said the party will be canceled, wait for some time to say.
Unexpectedly and predictably, on the first day of the Lunar New Year, the city government issued a notice to close public places, ask people not to meet, go out less, and notify the city has 3 cases.
The atmosphere in the country became tense. Originally, the New Year's Day there will be a lot of dragon dance, the results of a no, the street shops are also all closed. Of course, the usual bustling Mahjong parlors are closed.

The in-laws live on the street, and the neighbors know each other. In the afternoon, the parents-in-law because of something on the street, the results of others see them all bow their heads, far away.
I could feel their mixed feelings as I listened to my in-laws whisper about it over dinner. I also have mixed feelings, a little want to shed tears. They help us take care of our children in Wuhan all the year round, and can come back to talk with neighbors, relatives and friends, get together during the New Year.
Father-in-law is very good face, we have always been the pride of his hometown; this year, after my daughter went to school, he is still in my unit to do logistics work, I feel good.
This time, the parents-in-law to prepare for a period of time before returning home, tidy up the mood, ready to comfortably over the year. I didn't think so. With the outbreak, it all went to Hell. I can only comfort them, to understand everyone, we have to be a little self-conscious.

It's just that this subtle sense of rejection gets stronger over time. Early in the morning on the second day of the New Year, my daughter said she wanted to eat bean paste buns. In fact, the supermarket is right next door to our house, but my in-laws dare not go out.
After a long phone call, I couldn't find the right person to help me buy or deliver the goods to my door. Usually, the in-law parents are very fond of the granddaughter, especially in the dining area, change the pattern to do, want to eat anything as far as possible to meet. I never thought they would be satisfied with such a simple bean bag. I have a feeling that they feel the same psychological impact as they did the day before on the street.
Shortly after breakfast, my mother-in-law received a call from an acquaintance, asking if my family had gone to the hospital for an examination. My mother-in-law said there were rumors in the village about our family. It seems that our family in the eyes of the villagers, I am afraid and almost the god of plague.
My wife and I were afraid to ask, and it wasn't easy to explain. Let's just say, at this point, we have to understand that people don't understand our situation. However, this kind of psychological suggestion is afraid to influence the behavior of in-laws in appearance.
Lunch is prepared by her mother-in-law, the usual extreme attention of her, even ignored the daughter can not eat spicy, I do not eat spicy situation. As a result, I added a dish of fried pork with carrots.

After dinner, the mother-in-law asked her father-in-law, there are no fresh ribs? My father-in-law replied, "yes. ". His wife said it was okay to eat vegetables all the time. They say these things naturally, but I listen to them, but it's a bit of a shock.
Everyone seems to be vaguely worried about their daily lives. The family's Bacon is enough to celebrate the New Year, the vegetable garden is more adequate, this is the father-in-law and wife have confidence in place. But my daughter and I like to eat fresh vegetables, fresh meat is not enough, this should be the mother-in-law worried about.
In fact, when cooking at noon, my mind also jumped out of a question, if the liquefied gas do not do? WHAT IF WE RUN OUT OF RICE? Of course, I didn't even say it. According to the in-laws'way of doing things, it should be well-stocked before, I don't have to worry about it.

My wife and I are fine apart from each other at home these days, but I'm not sure my in-laws are.
Mother-in-law with her granddaughter, just because of the isolation, it's not a good job. We played with everything in the house, the kids got impatient, and yesterday afternoon we had to compromise and let her watch cartoons. Always good communication, love face-saving father-in-law, can only walk upstairs and downstairs, here lane, there to see, self-isolation, so as not to be hated by the villagers.
The in-laws have become marginal members of the local community. It was an experience I could relate to, but not necessarily understand.
This kind of experience of in-law parents, I am afraid that a lot of people from Hubei, especially Wuhan out of the common psychological feeling.

A classmate of mine, also a university professor, and I left Wuhan about the same time. When he got back to his hometown, he was quickly checked out. And, according to the local street and community management requirements, self-conscious Isolation, daily temperature.
But on the day of the New Year's Eve, his name, Identity Card number and detailed residential address have been leaked, his home district and surrounding several community owners group, every day in a frenzy to spread its information. And then it became a rumor that he was infected. Several neighbors even came to his house to try to persuade his family not to live in the neighborhood.
He was a local whose parents lived there for a long time, and whose acquaintances we usually met without looking up, so the pressure on him and his parents was understandable.
Another student, also a university teacher, was very nervous just because he had come to Wuhan for a meeting at the end of the year, and his family repeatedly told him not to say that he had been to Wuhan, otherwise the villagers did not know how they would look at their family.

These days, the network continues to spread a variety of "hard core" prevention and control measures, the most common is blocking the village road. It is of course a good thing that the masses of the people are mobilized, and it is also an expression of the superiority of our system. However, today is a great flow of society, the mobilization of the masses of the social base has also changed. A native returned from a strange land, suddenly became the enemy of his native land, I do not know whether it is a blessing or a curse?
Our family's identity has always been clear. I am a Hakka from Fujian, and although I have lived in Wuhan for 15 years, I still feel like a foreigner. When she was shopping in Wuhan, her hometown in Hunan Province, she often said that a passer-by was speaking the local dialect, and of course she identified herself as a native of Hunan.
When my daughter was born a few years ago, she was registered in Wuhan. I always hoped she was a Fujianese, but it seems a bit unrealistic. Because grandma and GRANDPA helped to take it, a Hunan dialect. But to say that she is a Hunan, but also not fair, after all, is to take my last name.
The wife said that she was from Wuhan. But I sincerely disagree with that assessment. Both my wife and I regard Wuhan as a foreign land. We can't let our daughter regard it as her hometown?
Now, I suddenly feel that I am from Wuhan. The local media in Wuhan had a saying that moved me very much. "Our city, we will defend. ". We have been unable to separate from Wuhan, even if the body is not present, but the heart has been present.

"The city of Wuhan after 24 hours, "empty city" Wuhan prices, traffic, living conditions. Source:@lin Chen Hearing

I regret leaving Wuhan. Since returning to the countryside, the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan has been so heart wrenching that the new year has become Hung Up. Had I known this, I might as well have stayed in Wuhan for the New Year and felt at ease.
The day of the siege, someone on the Internet kept showing off their "escape" from Wuhan, and I thought it was funny. In the face of disease, some people want to leave, some people want to stay; some people are playing the keyboard, some people are quietly doing their part. Life is full of surprises, but it's normal.
I talked to a documentary film producer in Wuhan on the phone last night. He said he would like to go back too. We have a lot in common, and we have a lot in common in documenting society and understanding its complexity. Wuhan closed, we would like to know the situation, but can not get in, we can only do anxious.
January 23, in Wuhan Hongxiang Road fresh market, residents wearing masks in an orderly manner in the market, supermarkets and other places to buy supplies

It's customary to go home for the New Year, but it has nothing to do with the epidemic. My wife and I boarded the train on the night of January 20(December twenty-six) to return to her hometown in Hunan Province for the Lunar New Year. When we entered Wuchang Railway Station, there was no screening; less than 20 per cent of the passengers in the waiting halls were observed wearing masks.
On the train, my wife and I discussed the outbreak and said that the people of Wuhan were so calm that they didn't even wear masks, but we thought it was normal, as long as no one passed it on, it wouldn't be a big problem.
Unexpectedly, when he returned home early the next morning, Zhong Nanshan was interviewed and confirmed that word had spread. The situation in Wuhan is also rapidly becoming tense and escalating, and epidemic prevention measures are gradually being carried out throughout the country.

The "hard core" epidemic prevention in Henan Province has been well received by public opinion because of its early development and effective measures. But in most parts of the country, epidemic prevention work has been carried out in succession.
The next day (January 21) morning, Fujian Home Village cadres on the contact me, asked me to go home, it seems that the investigation has been launched. But on the night of January 23rd, in the hometown of his wife in Hunan Province, village officials went to the house to check and register.
Village cadres do not know if it is not to offend us, said it is to cope with the task of the next higher level, also did not remind them to go out less and so on.
The in-laws returned home a few days early, and even a few days after our return, they were still busy visiting relatives and buying New Year goods. There was no sense of tension among the masses. After I received the information from my hometown in Fujian, I also lamented that Hunan had not yet rushed to prevent the epidemic.
My wife and I warned my in laws to stay indoors, to isolate ourselves -- not so much from ourselves as from others.
In accordance with the agreement years ago, New Year's Eve, aunts, uncles are with us. On the 29th day of the 12th month, his wife told his parents-in-law, or relatives said clearly, if there is taboo, not together with the New Year.
From the point of view of the in-laws, how to convey the meaning of our family is very delicate.
Of course, they can't just say, don't come, or you'll be shut out, but they can't say what we mean. After all, we're from Wuhan. The next day, everyone gathered together for the New Year.
Think, these are close relatives, even if the heart a little taboo, afraid will not take the initiative to cancel the family reunion. They probably have the same subtleties we do. If I Could Tell You, family, you're welcome.

Originally the first day of the New Year is to two uncle's house party, under our suggestion, New Year's Eve, mother-in-law still called uncle, said the party will be canceled, wait for some time to say.
Unexpectedly and predictably, on the first day of the Lunar New Year, the city government issued a notice to close public places, ask people not to meet, go out less, and notify the city has 3 cases.
The atmosphere in the country became tense. Originally, the New Year's Day there will be a lot of dragon dance, the results of a no, the street shops are also all closed. Of course, the usual bustling Mahjong parlors are closed.

The in-laws live on the street, and the neighbors know each other. In the afternoon, the parents-in-law because of something on the street, the results of others see them all bow their heads, far away.
I could feel their mixed feelings as I listened to my in-laws whisper about it over dinner. I also have mixed feelings, a little want to shed tears. They help us take care of our children in Wuhan all the year round, and can come back to talk with neighbors, relatives and friends, get together during the New Year.
Father-in-law is very good face, we have always been the pride of his hometown; this year, after my daughter went to school, he is still in my unit to do logistics work, I feel good.
This time, the parents-in-law to prepare for a period of time before returning home, tidy up the mood, ready to comfortably over the year. I didn't think so. With the outbreak, it all went to Hell. I can only comfort them, to understand everyone, we have to be a little self-conscious.

It's just that this subtle sense of rejection gets stronger over time. Early in the morning on the second day of the New Year, my daughter said she wanted to eat bean paste buns. In fact, the supermarket is right next door to our house, but my in-laws dare not go out.
After a long phone call, I couldn't find the right person to help me buy or deliver the goods to my door. Usually, the in-law parents are very fond of the granddaughter, especially in the dining area, change the pattern to do, want to eat anything as far as possible to meet. I never thought they would be satisfied with such a simple bean bag. I have a feeling that they feel the same psychological impact as they did the day before on the street.
Shortly after breakfast, my mother-in-law received a call from an acquaintance, asking if my family had gone to the hospital for an examination. My mother-in-law said there were rumors in the village about our family. It seems that our family in the eyes of the villagers, I am afraid and almost the god of plague.
My wife and I were afraid to ask, and it wasn't easy to explain. Let's just say, at this point, we have to understand that people don't understand our situation. However, this kind of psychological suggestion is afraid to influence the behavior of in-laws in appearance.
Lunch is prepared by her mother-in-law, the usual extreme attention of her, even ignored the daughter can not eat spicy, I do not eat spicy situation. As a result, I added a dish of fried pork with carrots.

After dinner, the mother-in-law asked her father-in-law, there are no fresh ribs? My father-in-law replied, "yes. ". His wife said it was okay to eat vegetables all the time. They say these things naturally, but I listen to them, but it's a bit of a shock.
Everyone seems to be vaguely worried about their daily lives. The family's Bacon is enough to celebrate the New Year, the vegetable garden is more adequate, this is the father-in-law and wife have confidence in place. But my daughter and I like to eat fresh vegetables, fresh meat is not enough, this should be the mother-in-law worried about.
In fact, when cooking at noon, my mind also jumped out of a question, if the liquefied gas do not do? WHAT IF WE RUN OUT OF RICE? Of course, I didn't even say it. According to the in-laws'way of doing things, it should be well-stocked before, I don't have to worry about it.

My wife and I are fine apart from each other at home these days, but I'm not sure my in-laws are.
Mother-in-law with her granddaughter, just because of the isolation, it's not a good job. We played with everything in the house, the kids got impatient, and yesterday afternoon we had to compromise and let her watch cartoons. Always good communication, love face-saving father-in-law, can only walk upstairs and downstairs, here lane, there to see, self-isolation, so as not to be hated by the villagers.
The in-laws have become marginal members of the local community. It was an experience I could relate to, but not necessarily understand.
This kind of experience of in-law parents, I am afraid that a lot of people from Hubei, especially Wuhan out of the common psychological feeling.
A paramedic checks the body temperature of a passenger as they arrive at a train station in Hankou Railway Station on Jan. 22

A classmate of mine, also a university professor, and I left Wuhan about the same time. When he got back to his hometown, he was quickly checked out. And, according to the local street and community management requirements, self-conscious Isolation, daily temperature.
But on the day of the New Year's Eve, his name, Identity Card number and detailed residential address have been leaked, his home district and surrounding several community owners group, every day in a frenzy to spread its information. And then it became a rumor that he was infected. Several neighbors even came to his house to try to persuade his family not to live in the neighborhood.
He was a local whose parents lived there for a long time, and whose acquaintances we usually met without looking up, so the pressure on him and his parents was understandable.
Another student, also a university teacher, was very nervous just because he had come to Wuhan for a meeting at the end of the year, and his family repeatedly told him not to say that he had been to Wuhan, otherwise the villagers did not know how they would look at their family.

These days, the network continues to spread a variety of "hard core" prevention and control measures, the most common is blocking the village road. It is of course a good thing that the masses of the people are mobilized, and it is also an expression of the superiority of our system. However, today is a great flow of society, the mobilization of the masses of the social base has also changed. A native returned from a strange land, suddenly became the enemy of his native land, I do not know whether it is a blessing or a curse?
Our family's identity has always been clear. I am a Hakka from Fujian, and although I have lived in Wuhan for 15 years, I still feel like a foreigner. When she was shopping in Wuhan, her hometown in Hunan Province, she often said that a passer-by was speaking the local dialect, and of course she identified herself as a native of Hunan.
When my daughter was born a few years ago, she was registered in Wuhan. I always hoped she was a Fujianese, but it seems a bit unrealistic. Because grandma and GRANDPA helped to take it, a Hunan dialect. But to say that she is a Hunan, but also not fair, after all, is to take my last name.
The wife said that she was from Wuhan. But I sincerely disagree with that assessment. Both my wife and I regard Wuhan as a foreign land. We can't let our daughter regard it as her hometown?
Now, I suddenly feel that I am from Wuhan. The local media in Wuhan had a saying that moved me very much. "Our city, we will defend. ". We have been unable to separate from Wuhan, even if the body is not present, but the heart has been present.

I regret leaving Wuhan. Since returning to the countryside, the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan has been so heart wrenching that the new year has become Hung Up. Had I known this, I might as well have stayed in Wuhan for the New Year and felt at ease.

The day of the siege, someone on the Internet kept showing off their "escape" from Wuhan, and I thought it was funny. In the face of disease, some people want to leave, some people want to stay; some people are playing the keyboard, some people are quietly doing their part. Life is full of surprises, but it's normal.

I talked to a documentary film producer in Wuhan on the phone last night. He said he would like to go back too. We have a lot in common, and we have a lot in common in documenting society and understanding its complexity. Wuhan closed, we would like to know the situation, but can not get in, we can only do anxious.
