During the outbreak, we heard stories of love and donations from volunteers. Every time this kind of big difficulty appears, everybody is enthusiastic, hope can make a contribution.

But doing good is a very professional thing. I've worked in the public sector for a few years, and I've met a lot of public sector partners who make a small salary, but are able to put every penny they have into helping more people with their limited resources.

Today, we're going to show you the stories of three people, and ask them to tell us what they experienced during this epidemic.

Hao Nan

Founder of NCP (new crown) life support network

12 years of preparation

Leaving a suicide note in 2008, I went to Wenchuan County with the intention of providing medical assistance on the ground. But I was soon surprised to find that there was a serious Information asymmetry between the disaster area and the rear. On the one hand is the disaster area material demand gap is huge, on the other hand is the national compassion donation has no place to put. Immediately, I decided to become a disaster information officer, to do intermediate coordination.

Later, I founded the Information asymmetry, which is dedicated to solving the problem of disaster response.

In the past 12 years, Zhuo Ming has been responding to disasters, including the Ya'an Earthquake, Yushu earthquake, Nepal earthquake and so on.

In this case, we have been in action since early January. By mid January, the information we had gathered indicated that Wuhan's medical resources had been exhausted, and I realized that this was an unprecedented public health crisis.

Zhuo Ming's expertise in natural disaster response partly failed. We have to adapt our model to do more for patients who don't have access to hospital resources.

On the night of January 22, I decided to launch the NCP life support network. It is an "online clinic" of volunteers with clinical qualifications, social workers and a psychological background who provide medical advice and psychological care to patients with NCP.

We had a lot of difficulties at first, such as the diversity of patients, the grading of doctors, and the lack of volunteers with both online management experience and medical skills. But the team worked around the clock to overcome them.

But as I look forward to working with local medical resources and communities to bring critically ill patients to the hospital, I find myself once again underestimating the enormity of the crisis.

Human tragedy

The primary focus of the online clinic was on the treatment of mild cases, as only in-patients with severe illnesses can receive timely and reliable treatment. But it was a lot more than that, and we started talking to people who were critically ill, and they were obviously supposed to be in the hospital. Our doctors all said, "you can't get out of the emergency room at this rate! "

But the patient always ends up telling him, "doc, I run to the emergency room every day, but I just can't stop. "

Our doctor was devastated when he found out. At this point, all of us realized how serious things had become, and the rapid changes that followed were still far beyond our expectations.

One night, we had dozens of critically ill patients in our clinic who had to be hospitalized but couldn't.

How can so many patients with so much weight not be hospitalized? What happened at the hospital?

At this point, our goal has been urgently shifted to focus on these very sick people. Because these critically ill patients can die at any time without proper medical support. And in fact, since that day, of the limited number of patients in our clinic, people have died every day, every day.

For doctors, they've seen death. That's what doctors do. They fight with death. But impotent is, they know how to save, but apart from the network, can do very limited. What can you do but also know what the patient has on hand? What's the situation, what medications can be adjusted, so he can wait a little longer before he gets to his bed.

I had a family of my own, and I'll never forget their story.

When contacted, his mother was already in severe respiratory distress, so every night they had to climb down from the sixth floor of an old neighborhood with no elevators and walk each other to the hospital, where the old man was given oxygen.

The hospital's emergency rooms are full at night, with no beds or even a place to sit. The three of them stood in the corridor, breathing in the cold air to get oxygen.

Breathing oxygen every night to stay alive, there was no other way. He had been doing this for six days when he called me. That day he finally bought an oxygen machine, can no longer go to the hospital!

I was happy for them. Every night to run the hospital, he has not slept for six days, especially suffering. And then the next morning, he called and said, "doctor, it's not good! I couldn't stay up last night. I went home to sleep. I wasn't at the old man's. My Dad just said my mom can't walk anymore. "

I said, "don't worry. Just go to the old man's house and see what's going on? Don't leave the old man alone. "

As a result, when he arrived, he saw his father extubating his mother. They made a decision not to go to the hospital. His father said it was too bad to go to the hospital. "Let's not die out there. Let's not be ghosts. Let's die in our own beds. ". "

Gave up treatment and died at home. It's the old man's decision.

The understanding of the world

Put the phone down. I haven't cried that hard in years. I realized there was nothing I could do.

I am a humanitarian, a person who should play a role in this situation, it is my profession, it is my mission.

But the accumulation of the next 12 years in Wenchuan County still leaves me with nothing to do at a time like this.

Critically ill patients need oxygen, even if only in terms of pain relief, and they should be given oxygen. So that day, I accelerated the oxygen machine project that I wanted to do.

But there's a lot of confusion along the way. At that time, the management did not believe that there was such a demand, do not believe that we survey the results of demand. I was angry, but I understood. This is the understanding of the world, the understanding between people is so.

Just as a month ago, none of us could have imagined such a tragedy in modern life.

Today we can talk. Today the government has announced. The number of severe cases now stands at more than 10,000, not including the number of people who have been cured, improved or died.

So going back to January 31st, there were over 10,000 seriously ill patients, and there were only 3,000 or 4,000 beds. Nearly 10,000 people are dying. Experiences like mine have happened to over 10,000 people.

So we're in a race against time, trying to get the oxygen machine here early.

The oxygen machine is just keeping him alive. To open more beds for them, more doctors and equipment would be needed. That's why I started the breathing thing again. Only breathing saves them.

In the early hours of February 5th, I contacted a pro bono partner who was also fundraising for sex machines, who had already raised thousands of them. But we figured out what we needed at the time, and it wasn't enough. No matter how hard we try, we'll only be able to save a couple of thousand of them. There are thousands of people out there, and we're GONNA watch their families die, and that is the most desperate moment of all.

So early in the morning on February 5, I started talking to my friends at the Palliative Care, and I said that there were a lot of people who might not survive, and I wondered if I could make their journey more dignified.

Wuhan Sports Center Stadium

The turning point came that night. CCTV news released the news of the Shelter Hospital that night. The shelter can accommodate thousands of beds. These beds could displace medical resources and free up at least two or three thousand beds for the very sick.

When I saw the news, I couldn't hold my breath. There's excitement, there's anger, there's guilt, there's regret.

At the time, all I said was, "why didn't you do this earlier? If there's such a thing, why didn't you do it sooner? "But I do see that there is hope for the thousands of patients who do not need our palliative care services. They'll survive.

Chen Dan

Co-sponsor of "Wuhan Ginkgo in action" project

A seed in the blank

My name is Chen Dan, is Hao Nan mentioned to raise oxygen machine public welfare partner.

I am dedicated to rural education of professional public welfare, so I know disaster relief is very professional, rashly involved may make trouble. So even though I was worried, I kept it to myself.

But on January 29th, I heard Hao Nan say he needed 20,000 oxygen meters. They're severely understaffed, and I'd like to help in any way I can.

■ Chen Dan shares on stage

But I didn't even know what an oximeter was, and I certainly couldn't do it alone. So I contacted more public interest people to join, did not expect that everyone gathered together so huge energy, the original oxygen demand was quickly resolved.

Realizing that we could do more for the front line, we launched the Wuhan Gingko in Action Project.

It was after witnessing the death of a patient at the Haonan Line Clinic that we realized we were no longer just working on a support project. I needed to race against the clock and compete with death.

From the morning of January 31, it was decided to start the oxygen generator project, and by 10 p.m. on February 6, the first oxygen generator was delivered to the patient. We had a round-the-clock oxygen relay.

We spend 24 hours finalizing the fundraising plan, selecting the oxygen machine model, and confirming the supplier's inventory.

On February 1st it hit it off with the Yuan Li Foundation, confirming its offer in just an hour. In the next two days, also with the fastest speed to prepare 50 oxygen machines, shipped to the emergency out of SF special air space in Shanghai.

But from here on, we have to confront the ultimate -- and the greatest -- difficulty -- of Foshan logistics.

Under traffic control in Wuhan at the time, reaching patients with the oxygen machine was more difficult than ever, taking four steps:

The first step is to send from Shanghai to the General Warehouse in Wuhan of Shunfeng;

The second step, from Wuhan General Warehouse to the warehouse of Chen's team in Huangpi District suburb of Wuhan;

In the third step, a blue sky rescue team will transport the oxygen generator from Huangpi District to the city

Finally, it is delivered to the patient by a convoy of volunteers from the city.

48 hours of life and death

It's been a particularly thrilling 48 hours.

There were deaths every day for days. On February 4th, one of our doctors, in a two-hour session online between 8:30 and 10:30, had three patients leave in front of him. It was so traumatic, the field advisory team had to pull him out.

We were devastated when we got the news the other day. From then on, we went crazy with every step of the process, urging them to faster, faster. At every turn, we say, "an hour earlier makes sense. "

At noon on February 5, Shunfeng logistics showed that the oxygen making machine arrived at the general warehouse in Wuhan. But the next 30 hours were excruciating and ineffectual.

Even if it reaches the main warehouse, it can't reach our warehouse. Because the logistics it has its own system, the national relief materials are gathered in the general warehouse in Wuhan, there is no way for us to specifically find that batch of materials, have to batch by batch to. No one knows when our supplies will be dispatched.

On the morning of February 6th, finally, progress was made, and supplies began to leave Wuhan General Warehouse for the SF Huangpi District Logistics Station, with contact information. We were so happy that we finally had a delivery guy to call and ask for details.

From then on, we began the "one hour report" strategy, responsible for logistics brother brother every hour to call brother Shun Fung, update progress.

However, an unexpected message came to us -- our supplies were scattered to five stations.

During the oxygen machine operation, we experienced the "three questions of death" . That was the first question.

Because he was waiting for the other 45, and they never delivered, so we asked for five. And as soon as he did, the other 45 arrived. We decided to wait until we had 50 before we sent them downtown.

At that time, the motorcade in Wuhan could not go out of the city at will. We found the blue sky rescue team with a pass, and they actually provided the Huangpi Warehouse. The Blue Sky rescue team can help us transport the oxygen machine from Huangpi District, on the outskirts of Wuhan, to the city, where it will be delivered to the patients by a convoy of volunteers. This kind of capacity is very valuable, so it's best to send 50 at a time.

At the time, SF express told us that the remaining 45 were due to arrive at the Huangpi District warehouse at 6:00. At the moment of 6 o'clock, everyone held their breath.

But we wait for the bad news. Because it was raining in Wuhan that day, the truck carrying 45 trucks got stuck in a mud pit and stopped 200 meters from the warehouse. We were miserable because we didn't know if it would come out and when. But at the time, only one of the blue sky teams had access to the city. Should we wait?

If you send five in first, the next 45 won't get to them because of a volunteer convoy or because of a conflict or because the patient can't get out of the neighborhood because of special rules.

But of the 50 names on that day, numbers 1 and 2 were critical. If we don't get them there in time, their names could turn gray the next day.

Five into the city, and those five have a good chance of making it through the night. But the remaining 45, though relatively less urgent, are rapidly evolving, and could become very severe overnight. That's the first question we face in death. Can it wait?

Fortunately, three or five minutes into the trip, the remaining 45 were out. All the people on the line were swimming in a crowd!

Finally, the first shipment was a one-off.

After arriving in the city at 9:00, a convoy of volunteers, depending on the severity of the injury, began to deliver the patient.

Patient One's Grandpa Zhang got it at 10:00. The oxygen tank he had bought before ran out in the afternoon. So when we told the family that it would arrive at 9:00, probably because it was the family's only hope, he waited from 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. and stood on the side of the road for five hours.

On the fourth day, he sent us a message saying that he had been able to come from his room to the couch to watch TV with the group because of the oxygen.

Even if after all that effort, only one of US survives, we all feel it's worth it.

No amount of finesse can overcome human nature

Help to send the first oxygen machine w big Wuhan Emergency Rescue Team convoy, the captain is a girl named Yi Ge. She's got three volunteers, four cars, and a city-wide delivery. On the afternoon of February 6, as soon as we told her that the 6:00 oxygen machine was leaving from Huangpi District, she immediately called in a team to stop a relatively less urgent delivery and quickly assemble at a rally point in the city.

We later learned that she hadn't slept for more than 30 hours.

As soon as the oxygen machine arrived, they set off in four separate cars, with the fastest one arriving in 30 minutes. However, in the process, something unexpected happened.

At that time, many patients were infected by the whole family, so we set up a no-contact contact procedure. When the convoy has lowered the oxygen machine, it leaves the area for 20 meters, and the patient goes to get it. But because it was so hectic, I wasn't able to explain to all the patients'families the principles of handover.

That night, brother Yi sent three people, two patients because really wait too long, very excited, straight to come, and her distance less than a meter.

After the delivery, she was a little angry. But as a team captain who supports pregnant women in Wuhan, she wasn't angry because of personal threats. The first thing she said to me was, "If I get infected, what will happen to the pregnant women I pick up? "? What about my team? What about my family? "

I just started crying, and I felt so guilty.

By about the third day, it was happening again.

On that day, another volunteer convoy, the Antioch Rescue Team, was in charge of delivery. The last patient was a couple of GRANDPAS and GRANDMAS. The old man was too ill to go downstairs, and the old woman was barely able to walk.

But the oxygen machine was too heavy for her to move. The team's coke brother had been working for us for more than 10 hours. When he heard that the old man was in great need, he had been helping his grandmother carry the oxygen machine into the elevator before leaving.

Two teams in a row had accidents that put the driver at risk, and we were in a lot of pain. There was a big argument within the group. Should the one-on-one rescue continue or not?

One can not be absolutely rational, especially in extreme circumstances. Brother Yi is in danger because he has waited too long. His family was dying, and brother Yi was carrying their only hope of survival, he forgot. And Big Cola is a very soft-hearted person. He thought about it before he made the decision. He knew perfectly well the principle of no contact, but he couldn't bear it. This is a delicate process can not be overcome.

Three questions of death

In addition to the pressure on the safety of the volunteer fleet, we face the second question of death: How should the limited number of 50 units be distributed while the follow-up oxygen machines are still being replenished, and whether we should reject today's critically ill patients and keep them in stock, for critical patients who could show up at any time tomorrow?

And the beds in Wuhan began to increase. If an oxygen machine was sent to a patient at home, one person could be saved; if it was sent to a hospital, five people could be saved. So who's the oxygen machine for? That's the last question of the three questions of death.

Our team could not bear the psychological pressure and finally made the difficult decision to stop the one-on-one rescue. In line with the quarantine point policy and the introduction of the Shelter Hospital policy, turn to support equipment can not keep up with the quarantine point hospital and other areas in Hubei serious epidemic.

With more funding and patterns in place, our team created a speed miracle -- in Florida, 230 oxygen machines were dispensed to an emergency ward in Huanggang City in just eight hours.

Currently, "Wuhan Ginkgo in action" has raised 2,321 oxygen machines, covering 158 medical sites in 14 cities in Hubei Province, and is still in operation.

I don't know about sweet

I think there's a lot of bitterness ahead, but there's also a lot of comfort in the back. I don't know about sweet.

You know, of course, that this is a very valuable thing to do, and it's helped some people survive. But you wouldn't dare call it a sense of accomplishment. Because it is the suffering of many, many people. You're just trying to make the pain go away.

——————

Of course, in addition to enthusiasm and professionalism, talk of the epidemic in the public welfare organizations, we will think of Han Hong Charity Foundation, Wuhan Red Cross, and other controversies.

Amid all the confusion, the public might ask, "why is it so difficult for my donations to end up in hospitals? In the face of Catastrophe, why is love always let down? "

Soda Water, Pro Bono fund-raiser

I have more than 10 years of experience in the nonprofit industry, and as a professional fund raiser, I can share some insider insights.

Level one: grab the mask

My most important job is raising money.

Once the money is raised, everyone expects it to be spent as soon as possible to get supplies to where they are most needed. So there's pressure to spend money quickly, and you can't hold it in your hand without spending it or spending it too slowly.

But prices change quickly, and when the price premium is too high, I become very hesitant. Because we don't want to buy and resell at a higher price, we want to think, "can we buy a normal product at five times the price now and then be able to hold up in the future? Is that the most responsible thing to do? "

But the donors are in a hurry. We would also like to send your love to the front line as soon as possible. But the face of high prices, public welfare institutions inevitably hesitate, then someone will rob goods.

So I had to go back to the next shipment. I finally found it. It's the same story all over again. Over time, the price will only go up.

■ from the network

What's the status on the masks? The public is buying, charities are buying, businesses are buying, wechat is buying, everyone is buying.

As soon as we placed the order, they just called and said, "there's a couple of trucks outside the factory, a bunch of bosses coming in with cash to pick up the goods, saying we need as many masks as you have. ". "

Instead of a $2 mask, we went from a high price to a $5 mask. They just took it all for $7 and sold it online for $12 the next day, selling it out overnight. The boss can make money on several houses in one night. Why don't you go into business?

And the moral imperative to grab a mask isn't that strong, because it's not a killer thing. At that time, Rob Mask, not patients, not medical care, but at home very anxious people, is wechat business customers.

I believe that most Chinese people are not capable of selling face masks at high prices to the first line of badly needed goods. But there are people who will pay top dollar for your face mask, and these people just stay at home and take out the trash every day. I don't have a moral burden. He'll buy anything that's rare.

There's no way you're gonNA take those guys.

Second Level: The second dealer

In addition, we also have to identify swindlers, two-way traffickers, is not taken from other countries to resell relief supplies? We've met before.

Just to be clear, we're not going to go through all the supplies. Let's say I raise a million dollars and use it to buy medical supplies. But the intermediate process is not the manufacturer to send the goods to me, and then from my warehouse to Wuhan. If it is a domestic source of goods, the general contact logistics manufacturers, direct delivery to the place.

Before each shipment, we will ask the manufacturer to affix the donor's Logo and name on it and send us a photo. To show how much material a company has donated.

On one occasion, however, I was surprised to find on Weibo that another donor had shown a photo that looked exactly like the one we had, even with the same background. And then, there was another celebrity fan club that wanted to buy supplies, and they came across this picture. The dealer then sent them the photo, saying he had the goods to sell them. Fan Club suspects corporate fraud.

We know, and immediately traced the number of each batch of goods, procedures, are complete. Therefore, it is probable that our goods are in good condition. But at one point, it didn't work out. What went wrong, you'll never know.

There are two probabilities. In the first case, he sold supplies to three agencies. We got the shipment, and the other two ended up with fake photos of the shipment. In the second case, the goods are signed for and O back.

For example, I purchased five boxes of face masks. Our work is done when the hospital signs for it, or when a unit signs for it. There's no way to get in there and give two masks to every doctor. And a lot can happen before these five boxes actually reach the doctor. One of them is that three cases have been transferred out again, but there's no trace in the middle. As a public good, we can't arrest people.

Map of donated materials in the warehouse / from the network

In fact, in the course of our procurement inquiry, someone said, "there is a way to get some donated materials, do you want them? "? "

He probably figured that our desire to score would lead us to some gray area. But in fact, he underestimated our work ethic and our standards of disclosure.

But I'm sure someone would buy something of this dubious provenance.

One is someone who has the ability to sell for a higher price; the other is someone who really knows that there's a group of people somewhere who need masks, and knows that there are 1,000 of them out there that they can get right away, so he won't ask any more questions, he'll buy them and deliver them first. At this point, ethics don't matter.

Phase three: Overseas Scams

In this case, no charity has the ability to compete with them. Finally, the more reliable way is to purchase overseas. But where there are people, there are scams. There are all kinds of interlocking rings.

For example, a Foreign Trade Company in Europe may have orders from several agencies, but only one shipment. It is essentially asking agencies to bid.

Another kind of trading company is like a scalper. It doesn't even have a mask on hand, but it does have information about which factories have it. It swindles you out of your needs and money, and then goes for the goods at a lower price.

We also have a situation. Suddenly an American manufacturer said they could sell us a suit for 80 bucks, which is usually about 100 bucks a piece. But it didn't happen that way, and then we found out that the suits were long overdue.

There's not a big market for protective clothing. Cruel as it was, this outbreak was a bonus for him, and he finally had a chance to sell off his inventory, and he wanted to sell all his suits.

We didn't buy it when we found out. But do you think anyone else bought it?

Let's hope it doesn't end up in the hands of the front office.
