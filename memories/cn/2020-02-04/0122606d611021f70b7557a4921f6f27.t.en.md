Returning to his hometown in Dongying, Shandong Province, Qin Li did not have a good year.

Since the second day of the Lunar New Year, she has received not "Good New Year" greetings, but caring messages from many strangers: "I wish you a speedy recovery. " She was not touched, but felt weird. At the end of her observation period today, she did not show any symptoms of new pneumonia, but in the words of these strangers, the medical student from Wuhan returned with high fever and has entered the intensive-care unit.

All this sudden concern came from a screenshot of a form widely circulated on the Internet, which included information about seven febrile patients, including Qin Li, down to ID card numbers, home addresses and personal phone numbers, and their return from Wuhan.

Within two days of the city's closure announced on January 23,30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions began a first-level response to major public health emergencies. Epidemic Prevention and control to the grass-roots level, the streets, neighborhood committees, village committees and other grass-roots management of the community began to all of Wuhan returnees to carry out a comprehensive investigation and information report. Subsequently, the Internet in the form of screenshots and documents widely spread in the form of information leakage events began to occur in intensive places.

The panic over the outbreak did not end with the closing of the Han corridor. These intentionally or unintentionally before the special time node to leave Wuhan, returned to their hometown, all involuntarily became "deserters" and "plague God.

The rapid spread of personal information on the Internet has led to a campaign against returnees in Wuhan. The fear of disease that is hard to catch and control has given rise to entities in cities and counties from Wuhan to Hubei, and the fight against the epidemic has turned into discrimination against specific people.

These days, Qin Li is always telling me that she wants to go back to Wuhan. Before leaving, she was an active medical student on the front lines; after returning home, she was stripped of all her labels. In the face of the fever diagnosis under the hospital easily, in the face of the personal information that was forwarded indiscriminately, in the face of the strange car that suddenly appeared in the yard, Qin Li could do nothing.

Because at the moment, she is only a "person returning from Wuhan" .

That you're not allowed to cross

On January 20, Qin Li finished his last day at the hospital.

For Medical School Students, such a holiday time is still early. According to past experience, it is normal to be on duty until New Year's Eve, or the first two days of the New Year. This year, affected by the Wuhan Epidemic, the hospital departments one after another have given medical students a holiday, let them go home as soon as possible.

Qin Li bought a ticket back to Shandong on the 21st. She heard that the high-speed railway had started to register all people departing from Wuhan. The day before, Zhong Nanshan had also come forward to give a positive response to the epidemic and affirm the "human-to-human transmission" of the new type of pneumonia. But she wasn't stopped on the way. I panicked, thinking the government had missed me.

Back home in the village, Qinli began to consciously self-isolation, daily temperature measurement. Two consecutive days have measured 37 degrees 1,37 degrees 2 values, although know that her own basal body temperature on the high side, but in the current special circumstances, Qin Li's father or not at ease. "I just thought I'd go to the county hospital and have it checked out, " he said

Go Straight to the hospital fever clinic, Qinli Guide doctor explained that she just returned from Wuhan, as well as these days his body temperature on the high side of the situation, hope can do a test, figure a psychological comfort. The doctor on duty came out of the exam room and asked about her temperature. No auscultation was done. No blood tests and CT scans were scheduled. "The first thing he said was 'that's the quarantine. ' ". Qin Li, a medical student, was disgusted by this response.

She had just returned from the front line after more than 20 days in the hospital, where she brought out the first edition of the COVID-19 and explained to doctors that she had not met the criteria for quarantine, the doctor was asked to wait for the results of her examination before deciding whether she should be placed under house observation or hospitalised for isolation.

And according to common sense, Qin Li's temperature at that time was 36 degrees 8, while her highest temperature in those days was 37 degrees 2. "It is not a fever in medicine, the diagnosis of low fever is 37 degrees 3. ".

The doctor agreed and took her to another clinic. A nurse took her case file and wrote down "hot for 4 days, lungs aspirated by Auscultation" . Qin Li immediately concluded that the nurses had written according to the symptoms of pneumonia, and on the spot proposed that the diagnosis was unprofessional in operation, "I haven't had a check-up yet, but I wrote it up. If something goes wrong, I won't be able to explain it. "

She tried to reason with the doctor again, but was told she couldn't go into the emergency room. Only then did Qinli realize that the horizontal line drawn at the door of the emergency room was used to isolate all the people returning from Wuhan.

After all the tests, all of Qinli's vital signs were normal, and no doctors or nurses continued to ask her to stay in the hospital for observation, so she went home. The next day, a phone call from the county hospital asked for her ID number and home address. "I thought I was supposed to collect information about missing Wuhan returnees, so I didn't think twice about reporting it. "

That day is New Year's Eve, Qin Li in the county hospital did not affect the family reunion dinner, and all the traditional Shandong families, her family ate dumplings. Everything in the village was the same as it had been in previous years, families eating their New Year's Eve dinners, sitting around watching CCTV New Year's Gala on the television, the sound of firecrackers hanging from the window, lively as ever.

The Qin Li that brushes mobile phone message all the time does not get happy all the time. She and Wuhan's distance in a circle of friends and groups of news, become extremely close, these familiar people and places, became the protagonist of the anti-epidemic Front Story.

Qin Li's hospital has issued a notice to accept donations from alumni. Many medical school teachers and classmates remained on the front lines, but lacked the necessary N95 masks and goggles. Finally, it was the video of the head of the department breaking down and crying, which made her cry.

After midnight, qin Li sent out a friend circle: "My classmate friend, the teacher is the same door so suddenly ground is pushed to the front. ". It's like a nightmare, but I can't wake up. Worry, fear, cowardice, frustration, powerlessness... I can't tell what's bothering me. I keep asking myself what I can do, but I find I can't do anything. I can't go to the front line. I have no supplies, no money. Even at home, I'm isolated with my family."

At the end of the passage, she makes her first wish for the year of the rat: that when she wakes up, there will be good news.

The car outside the yard

She didn't get what she wanted.

Since the morning of the 26th, she has been receiving frequent friend requests from strangers in Dongying, Shandong Province, most of which include "get well soon. ". At that time, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Fujian and other places have appeared in Wuhan returnees suffered information leakage cases, Qin Li guessed that she should have suffered a similar thing.

According to several seemingly friendly people, their responses confirmed her theory that a form registering her January 23 appointment at the county hospital had been leaked and circulated on the Internet.

In the screenshot of the form, titled "Statistics Table of partial fever patients, " seven people, including Qin Li, had contact histories in Wuhan, but three did not even register temperature data and the time of their first fever, one of them had "no symptoms" under "symptoms. ".

Qin Li's temperature of 36.8 degrees on that day was not marked. The data left on it was a self-reported maximum temperature of 37.2 degrees, which she reported to her doctor at the time. The symptoms were summed up as "fever. ". In other words, the results of her medical examination were not accepted, the concerns raised with the doctors and nurses were not addressed, and the county hospital still registered the diagnosis on the medical record.

She also obtained another document, titled "457 people in Dongying (1) " . From January 1 to 20,457 people in Dongying have their personal information clearly marked, including ID card numbers, household registration addresses and train schedules. In Dongying, such forms can be easily retrieved from their social networks and retweeted.
The form received by Qin included traffic information from 457 people in Dongying

She asked the person who called the county hospital on Jan. 24 to gather information. The response was that the form had not been leaked from him and that it was not his responsibility. Qin Li also called the Screenshot County Epidemic Management Leading Group Office of the contact telephone, the answer is exactly the same. "I was angry and asked them, 'if you didn't leak, you wouldn't be responsible? ' "

A contact in the office of the Leading Group promised to help Qin deal with the matter, but she found that the screenshot was still circulating in group chats across Dongying. In the evening, Qin Li began to receive a large number of care messages from strange numbers. There were 20 or 30 unadded friends on Wechat. Some friends and classmates also suddenly sent form screenshots and greetings, asking her about her health.

To her Chagrin, even her brother, who is a senior in high school, has received screenshots from classmates. The head teacher privately enjoined his brother not to go to school for the time being.

Qin Li called the police. She looked up the "infectious disease prevention and Control Act, " the disease control and prevention agencies intentionally divulged suspected infectious disease patients' personal information, will bear legal responsibility.

"I am well aware that this is a time of national crisis, but human rights should not be ignored. And I've just come back from the front line, I know better than they do what's going on in Wuhan, and I know better than they do that it's going to take a concerted effort, so I've been isolating myself."

That day, the police did not respond to calls, but Qin Li saw from his home surveillance, the courtyard outside a number of cars parked inexplicably. "We can't visit our relatives in the New Year, " he said. "Who would park so long on the side of the road, and we haven't seen any of the people on the bus. "

On January 28, the fourth day of the first lunar month, a distant relative came by unannounced. Far from home, they were stopped by the people on the bus, or in Qin Li's words, "drive away, drive away. ". Looking at the back of his mother running out to solve the encirclement, Qin Li suddenly felt special fear.

"I wanted to be isolated myself, and it was not the same feeling to be out there spying on me. They acted as if I was terminally ill and my family was now the source of the virus, all they needed to do was to put a seal on our home. "

Encounter information leak the next day, Qin Li also received a harassment phone call, "the man said I should not come back, bring back the virus. ". On second thought, she told her father about it.

Father and daughter have been on the fence for two days because of their insistence on accountability. "He was also very angry at first. I don't know who he called. These people told me not to hang on to this and not to make any more trouble. They said there was no privacy in the face of the epidemic. My Dad was convinced. "

The same was true in January, when Qin Li was still in Wuhan. There were no mass reports of new pneumonia then, and she could only persuade her parents not to visit this year by repeating the severity of the outbreak she had learned on the front lines. At the time, her status as a medical student did not lend her credibility at home; but now, "when I tell them there's no need to panic, they start freaking out again. "

Can Not understand the daughter why so persistent Qin Li father, believe that the epidemic has developed to a lot of things can give way to the point. But in the eyes of Qin Li, this is not a question that can be simply explained as who is subordinate to whom, "wrong is wrong, and breaking the law is illegal. At any time, it is illegal to divulge private information of citizens. As long as China or China, it is illegal. Apologize for doing something wrong. A child knows the truth, but an adult forgets it. "

As a result of the father-daughter conversation, Qinli continued to defend her rights, and her father no longer tried to persuade her to accept the status quo. Over the next few days, she searched nearly every department she could find, from the Municipal Health Commission to the county health commission, to the municipal epidemic management headquarters, and even to the mayor's hotline.

On February 2, Qin Li told me that she had finally received feedback from the City Health Commission that she would talk to her in detail after the quarantine period. The last time she spoke to them was five days ago, when they replied that the messages were being posted and gave her the number of the county health commission.

At the same time, she sent me an "urgent notice on further improving the security and confidentiality of epidemic prevention and control work" from the city's epidemic disposal headquarters office, signed on January 27, the day after she was exposed.


That I couldn't get

To Wuhan this city, Qin Li originally neither dislike, also do not calculate to have the sentiment.

She was transferred to Wuhan, it was only as a stepping stone to leave Shandong. After such a thing happened in her hometown, she had an unprecedented sense of belonging to Wuhan, "At least better than we here. ".

She hasn't left the House since New Year's Eve. Listen to the village megaphone notice, their village from the beginning of the New Year road closure, into the village road are built up with soil, leaving only one or two mouth can be out of the car. The village committee went door-to-door on the second day of the Lunar New Year, said this year the village can not go door-to-door, "copy Henan's homework, no matter what, first take copy again. "

Qin Li was referring to videos and photos circulating on microblogs during the Lunar New Year, when villages in Henan were bracing themselves for the spread of the disease by erecting walls, piling up soil and even digging up roads to cut off the flow of people. Later, some media pointed out that it might be illegal to restrict villagers'personal freedom in such an extreme way.

She began to envy those students who did not leave Wuhan because of the "closure of the city" . The students who stayed on campus were warned not to leave their dorms, but after taking precautions, they were able to go out to the supermarket and sit around the dorms cooking hotpot. The students'canteen also began to provide free meals and take Bento to the dormitory downstairs on the third day of the Lunar New Year. "They are much happier than we are. All of us who go home are restricted in our personal freedom. People are at least free. "

On 27 January, her hospital's Office of policy and training issued a notice on the Organization of training during the outbreak control period, in the absence of a notice from the school to postpone the start of the school year, no special circumstances students need to return to Wuhan to continue to complete the training work.

There is no fixed return time and return to the Han method, in Wuhan hospitals are material emergency situation, also can not make the commitment of security, this notice caused a great backlash of medical students. But Qin Li couldn't wait to apply to the teachers, because the regulations and Training Office can help to issue the application for temporary passage back to Wuhan.

Call back to the Han medical students that day, Qin Li heard that a classmate has been given a temporary pass, the same day to hide from his family all the way from home to Changsha by high-speed rail. But the student was stopped at the crossing into Wuhan because the staff at the high-speed railway station did not receive the relevant clearance notice. The first mover's failure lowered her psychological expectations, because not wanting to stay was a more pressing problem than not wanting to go back.

She told me that she had planned to return to Wuhan on Feb. 1, but the school had just issued a notice that all spring festival leavers would not be allowed to return to school early, meaning the program office was no longer able to help students return to Wuhan. Many students in Wuhan heard that she wanted to go back, also advised her to calm down, "but I can not stay. "

Qin Li has told his family several times that he wants to go back to Wuhan after he found out that his home was being monitored. "They all say it's going to take a lot of material to get back to Wuhan, but I think I'll be fine there. And at least when I get back, my family won't have to. "

After the hope of returning to Wuhan was temporarily dashed, Qin Li could only continue to wait at home for the end of the isolation period. These days her mood is always very ups and downs, in order to adjust her mood, she will look for some good news on purpose, "If I haven't seen a request for supplies recently, I feel happy, as if the epidemic is under control, as if the thing is about to come to an end. "
A film still from "the flu"

The night that Qin Li told me she couldn't go back to Wuhan, I asked her a question: If Wuhan really needed someone one day, to gather a group of medical students willing to go to the front without adequate protection, how many MED students would be happy to go back?

"I think most of us will go back, " he said. "There are a lot of lonely people like us who are single-minded. "

Among her classmates, a friend of mine was one of the local medical students who had returned to the hospital with their families in Wuhan. Although he was not in the core department, he still had to stay on duty at the hospital to deal with emergency patients and follow-up patients because of the shortage of front-line staff, it is equipped with a common surgical mask and disposable isolation clothing.

On New Year's Eve, his department received a little boy, fever, no mask, crying and coughing. They eventually determined that the patient's symptoms could be a sign of COVID-19 infection in a young child and advised his parents to send him to a fever clinic.

My friend once complained to me that medical school wasn't worth it, given the frequency of injuries and the high pressure of the current epidemic. But when the department called him back, he told me, "As a medical student, I still have feelings and responsibilities to the department, and I think I should help. Someone has to go, and if I don't go, the pressure on others will be even greater. I just think it would be better if I used to share some of the pressure. "

Qin Li told me something similar. She once told me that she had been transferred to medical school, and that she thought she could at least get a job. This time she was so eager to return to Wuhan that, rather than talking about medical ideals and sacrifice, she wanted to be seen as an equal and at least useful person.

"They say students don't have to go to the clinic, but it's good if they can use my help. At least I can stay in my department and not give them any trouble. Anyway, I always want to be able to do something. "

Returning to his hometown in Dongying, Shandong Province, Qin Li did not have a good year.

Since the second day of the Lunar New Year, she has received not "Good New Year" greetings, but caring messages from many strangers: "I wish you a speedy recovery.

That you're not allowed to cross

On January 20, Qin Li finished his last day at the hospital.

This year, affected by the Wuhan Epidemic, the hospital departments one after another have given medical students a holiday, let them go home as soon as possible.

Two consecutive days have measured 37 degrees 1,37 degrees 2 values, although know that her own basal body temperature on the high side, but in the current special circumstances, Qin Li's father or not at ease. "I just thought I'd go to the county hospital and have it checked out, " he said

Go Straight to the hospital fever clinic, Qinli Guide doctor explained that she just returned from Wuhan, as well as these days his body temperature on the high side of the situation, hope can do a test, figure a psychological comfort.

And according to common sense, Qin Li's temperature at that time was 36 degrees 8, while her highest temperature in those days was 37 degrees 2. "It is not a fever in medicine, the diagnosis of low fever is 37 degrees 3. ".

The doctor agreed and took her to another clinic. A nurse took her case file and wrote down "hot for 4 days, lungs aspirated by Auscultation" . Qin Li immediately concluded that the nurses had written according to the symptoms of pneumonia, and on the spot proposed that the diagnosis was unprofessional in operation, "I haven't had a check-up yet, but I wrote it up. If something goes wrong, I won't be able to explain it. "

After all the tests, all of Qinli's vital signs were normal, and no doctors or nurses continued to ask her to stay in the hospital for observation, so she went home. The next day, a phone call from the county hospital asked for her ID number and home address. "I thought I was supposed to collect information about missing Wuhan returnees, so I didn't think twice about reporting it. "

That day is New Year's Eve, Qin Li in the county hospital did not affect the family reunion dinner, and all the traditional Shandong families, her family ate dumplings. Everything in the village was the same as it had been in previous years, families eating their New Year's Eve dinners, sitting around watching CCTV New Year's Gala on the television, the sound of firecrackers hanging from the window, lively as ever.

The Qin Li that brushes mobile phone message all the time does not get happy all the time. She and Wuhan's distance in a circle of friends and groups of news, become extremely close, these familiar people and places, became the protagonist of the anti-epidemic Front Story.

Qin Li's hospital has issued a notice to accept donations from alumni. Many medical school teachers and classmates remained on the front lines, but lacked the necessary N95 masks and goggles. Finally, it was the video of the head of the department breaking down and crying, which made her cry.

After midnight, qin Li sent out a friend circle: "My classmate friend, the teacher is the same door so suddenly ground is pushed to the front. ". It's like a nightmare, but I can't wake up. Worry, fear, cowardice, frustration, powerlessness... I can't tell what's bothering me. I keep asking myself what I can do, but I find I can't do anything. I can't go to the front line. I have no supplies, no money. Even at home, I'm isolated with my family."

At the end of the passage, she makes her first wish for the year of the rat: that when she wakes up, there will be good news.

The car outside the yard

She didn't get what she wanted.

Since the morning of the 26th, she has been receiving frequent friend requests from strangers in Dongying, Shandong Province, most of which include "get well soon. ". At that time, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Fujian and other places have appeared in Wuhan returnees suffered information leakage cases, Qin Li guessed that she should have suffered a similar thing.

According to several seemingly friendly people, their responses confirmed her theory that a form registering her January 23 appointment at the county hospital had been leaked and circulated on the Internet.

In the screenshot of the form, titled "Statistics Table of partial fever patients, " seven people, including Qin Li, had contact histories in Wuhan, but three did not even register temperature data and the time of their first fever, one of them had "no symptoms" under "symptoms. ".

Qin Li's temperature of 36.8 degrees on that day was not marked. The data left on it was a self-reported maximum temperature of 37.2 degrees, which she reported to her doctor at the time. The symptoms were summed up as "fever. ". In other words, the results of her medical examination were not accepted, the concerns raised with the doctors and nurses were not addressed, and the county hospital still registered the diagnosis on the medical record.

She also obtained another document, titled "457 people in Dongying (1) " . From January 1 to 20,457 people in Dongying have their personal information clearly marked, including ID card numbers, household registration addresses and train schedules. In Dongying, such forms can be easily retrieved from their social networks and retweeted.

In Dongying, such forms can be easily retrieved from their social networks and retweeted.

The form received by Qin included traffic information from 457 people in Dongying

She asked the person who called the county hospital on Jan. 24 to gather information. The response was that the form had not been leaked from him and that it was not his responsibility. Qin Li also called the Screenshot County Epidemic Management Leading Group Office of the contact telephone, the answer is exactly the same. "I was angry and asked them, 'if you didn't leak, you wouldn't be responsible? ' "

A contact in the office of the Leading Group promised to help Qin deal with the matter, but she found that the screenshot was still circulating in group chats across Dongying. In the evening, Qin Li began to receive a large number of care messages from strange numbers. There were 20 or 30 unadded friends on Wechat. Some friends and classmates also suddenly sent form screenshots and greetings, asking her about her health.

To her Chagrin, even her brother, who is a senior in high school, has received screenshots from classmates. The head teacher privately enjoined his brother not to go to school for the time being.

Qin Li called the police. She looked up the "infectious disease prevention and Control Act, " the disease control and prevention agencies intentionally divulged suspected infectious disease patients' personal information, will bear legal responsibility.

"I am well aware that this is a time of national crisis, but human rights should not be ignored. And I've just come back from the front line, I know better than they do what's going on in Wuhan, and I know better than they do that it's going to take a concerted effort, so I've been isolating myself."

That day, the police did not respond to calls, but Qin Li saw from his home surveillance, the courtyard outside a number of cars parked inexplicably. "We can't visit our relatives in the New Year, " he said. "Who would park so long on the side of the road, and we haven't seen any of the people on the bus. "

On January 28, the fourth day of the first lunar month, a distant relative came by unannounced. Far from home, they were stopped by the people on the bus, or in Qin Li's words, "drive away, drive away. ". Looking at the back of his mother running out to solve the encirclement, Qin Li suddenly felt special fear.

"I wanted to be isolated myself, and it was not the same feeling to be out there spying on me. They acted as if I was terminally ill and my family was now the source of the virus, all they needed to do was to put a seal on our home. "

Encounter information leak the next day, Qin Li also received a harassment phone call, "the man said I should not come back, bring back the virus. ". On second thought, she told her father about it.

Father and daughter have been on the fence for two days because of their insistence on accountability. "He was also very angry at first. I don't know who he called. These people told me not to hang on to this and not to make any more trouble. They said there was no privacy in the face of the epidemic. My Dad was convinced. "

The same was true in January, when Qin Li was still in Wuhan. There were no mass reports of new pneumonia then, and she could only persuade her parents not to visit this year by repeating the severity of the outbreak she had learned on the front lines. At the time, her status as a medical student did not lend her credibility at home; but now, "when I tell them there's no need to panic, they start freaking out again. "

Can Not understand the daughter why so persistent Qin Li father, believe that the epidemic has developed to a lot of things can give way to the point. But in the eyes of Qin Li, this is not a question that can be simply explained as who is subordinate to whom, "wrong is wrong, and breaking the law is illegal. At any time, it is illegal to divulge private information of citizens. As long as China or China, it is illegal. Apologize for doing something wrong. A child knows the truth, but an adult forgets it. "

As a result of the father-daughter conversation, Qinli continued to defend her rights, and her father no longer tried to persuade her to accept the status quo. Over the next few days, she searched nearly every department she could find, from the Municipal Health Commission to the county health commission, to the municipal epidemic management headquarters, and even to the mayor's hotline.

On February 2, Qin Li told me that she had finally received feedback from the City Health Commission that she would talk to her in detail after the quarantine period. The last time she spoke to them was five days ago, when they replied that the messages were being posted and gave her the number of the county health commission.

At the same time, she sent me an "urgent notice on further improving the security and confidentiality of epidemic prevention and control work" from the city's epidemic disposal headquarters office, signed on January 27, the day after she was exposed.

She asked the person who called the county hospital on Jan. 24 to gather information. The response was that the form had not been leaked from him and that it was not his responsibility.

That I couldn't get

To Wuhan this city, Qin Li originally neither dislike, also do not calculate to have the sentiment.

She was transferred to Wuhan, it was only as a stepping stone to leave Shandong. After such a thing happened in her hometown, she had an unprecedented sense of belonging to Wuhan, "At least better than we here. ".

She hasn't left the House since New Year's Eve. Listen to the village megaphone notice, their village from the beginning of the New Year road closure, into the village road are built up with soil, leaving only one or two mouth can be out of the car. The village committee went door-to-door on the second day of the Lunar New Year, said this year the village can not go door-to-door, "copy Henan's homework, no matter what, first take copy again. "

Qin Li was referring to videos and photos circulating on microblogs during the Lunar New Year, when villages in Henan were bracing themselves for the spread of the disease by erecting walls, piling up soil and even digging up roads to cut off the flow of people. Later, some media pointed out that it might be illegal to restrict villagers'personal freedom in such an extreme way.

She began to envy those students who did not leave Wuhan because of the "closure of the city" . The students who stayed on campus were warned not to leave their dorms, but after taking precautions, they were able to go out to the supermarket and sit around the dorms cooking hotpot. The students'canteen also began to provide free meals and take Bento to the dormitory downstairs on the third day of the Lunar New Year. "They are much happier than we are. All of us who go home are restricted in our personal freedom. People are at least free. "

On 27 January, her hospital's Office of policy and training issued a notice on the Organization of training during the outbreak control period, in the absence of a notice from the school to postpone the start of the school year, no special circumstances students need to return to Wuhan to continue to complete the training work.

There is no fixed return time and return to the Han method, in Wuhan hospitals are material emergency situation, also can not make the commitment of security, this notice caused a great backlash of medical students. But Qin Li couldn't wait to apply to the teachers, because the regulations and Training Office can help to issue the application for temporary passage back to Wuhan.

Call back to the Han medical students that day, Qin Li heard that a classmate has been given a temporary pass, the same day to hide from his family all the way from home to Changsha by high-speed rail. But the student was stopped at the crossing into Wuhan because the staff at the high-speed railway station did not receive the relevant clearance notice. The first mover's failure lowered her psychological expectations, because not wanting to stay was a more pressing problem than not wanting to go back.

She told me that she had planned to return to Wuhan on Feb. 1, but the school had just issued a notice that all spring festival leavers would not be allowed to return to school early, meaning the program office was no longer able to help students return to Wuhan. Many students in Wuhan heard that she wanted to go back, also advised her to calm down, "but I can not stay. "

Qin Li has told his family several times that he wants to go back to Wuhan after he found out that his home was being monitored. "They all say it's going to take a lot of material to get back to Wuhan, but I think I'll be fine there. And at least when I get back, my family won't have to. "

After the hope of returning to Wuhan was temporarily dashed, Qin Li could only continue to wait at home for the end of the isolation period. These days her mood is always very ups and downs, in order to adjust her mood, she will look for some good news on purpose, "If I haven't seen a request for supplies recently, I feel happy, as if the epidemic is under control, as if the thing is about to come to an end. "

"

A film still from "the flu"

The night that Qin Li told me she couldn't go back to Wuhan, I asked her a question: If Wuhan really needed someone one day, to gather a group of medical students willing to go to the front without adequate protection, how many MED students would be happy to go back?

"I think most of us will go back, " he said. "There are a lot of lonely people like us who are single-minded. "

Among her classmates, a friend of mine was one of the local medical students who had returned to the hospital with their families in Wuhan. Although he was not in the core department, he still had to stay on duty at the hospital to deal with emergency patients and follow-up patients because of the shortage of front-line staff, it is equipped with a common surgical mask and disposable isolation clothing.

On New Year's Eve, his department received a little boy, fever, no mask, crying and coughing. They eventually determined that the patient's symptoms could be a sign of COVID-19 infection in a young child and advised his parents to send him to a fever clinic.

My friend once complained to me that medical school wasn't worth it, given the frequency of injuries and the high pressure of the current epidemic. But when the department called him back, he told me, "As a medical student, I still have feelings and responsibilities to the department, and I think I should help. Someone has to go, and if I don't go, the pressure on others will be even greater. I just think it would be better if I used to share some of the pressure. "

Qin Li told me something similar. She once told me that she had been transferred to medical school, and that she thought she could at least get a job. This time she was so eager to return to Wuhan that, rather than talking about medical ideals and sacrifice, she wanted to be seen as an equal and at least useful person.

"They say students don't have to go to the clinic, but it's good if they can use my help. At least I can stay in my department and not give them any trouble. Anyway, I always want to be able to do something. "
