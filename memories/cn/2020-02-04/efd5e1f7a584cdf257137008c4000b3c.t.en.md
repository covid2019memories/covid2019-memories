January 21 from Wuhan back to Qianjiang, detailed records see, no computer, on the mobile phone notes, more scattered. Until yesterday exactly two weeks, a quarantine period (probably not strict quarantine, especially in the last few days) . Yesterday was the last day of quarantine, in the afternoon there was a slight indisposition, thought the last day of quarantine had a problem, fortunately only false alarm. Looking ahead to Wuhan. Probably easy, too. To the unit out of documents, proof of physical health to live. If you continue to write, it should be called "back to Wuhan Ji. ".

The first seven days (1.21-27) Deep Web Push: a Wuhan poet's town isolation diary | Deep Web, only the following (1.28-2.3) .

1-28, fourth day, day eight of quarantine.

A total of 1771 cases were newly diagnosed in China, and 1291 in Hubei Province, including 892 in Wuhan. In my diary yesterday, I used "only" to describe Wuhan's growth: Only 80 cases. Who would have thought that today's number would be multiplied by 10. According to the report, this is due to increased detection capabilities. Absolute numbers can still be replaced by new shocks.

It's a better day. It's really sunny. Get up when the eyes of Hoar Frost and fog, the sun out, fog dispersed, Hoar Frost into water droplets. The chickens in the back of the house were calling a little louder, too, and her mother in Law said that on sunny days, chickens lay their eggs earlier than usual. The Brook was attracted by the call of the chicken. I took her to see it. Small animals the size of chickens, cats or dogs, and streams are all favorite. But of these animals, the only one that squawks is the egg-laying chicken, which makes it particularly attractive. We arrived at the backyard coop side, she toward the chicken a gallop, the chicken is clucking clucking voice, suddenly a Yang neck, called out that "DA" . More than twice as loud, the stream shuddered and took a step back.

Since yesterday, the Stream has become less familiar. Mother-in-law and sister-in-law can occasionally take over a hug. Her niece played hide-and-seek with her, and she was very cooperative, with a bright smile. The wife is very gratified, say this is the purpose that wants to bring a stream back, experience true sisterly happiness. In Wuhan, with the neighbors, after all, not as close as home.

The closeness to the creek, and the further sense of family, may have been the result of this isolation. After Kobe's death yesterday, I was particularly struck by the statements of two people. One is Perkins Engines. He had been sparring with his former team mate Durant and taunting each other, before suddenly tweeting yesterday that he regretted it and hoped to get back together with Durant. The other is Pau Gasol. Bryant, he said in an interview, made him understand that the stats, the NBA career, the contract salary, none of it mattered. He just wanted to go home to his daughter.

In the face of life and death, everything is a small matter. I was talking to Fan Xiaodong before I went to bed last night, and I had this feeling, as if I'd been in quarantine since I saw the storm outside. Disillusionment is based on the fact that everything you see is gone, and you're overwhelmed by things you never thought you'd see. I said to Fan Xiaodong, this virus incident, basically will let me revise my outlook on life. One of the corrections is to love life more, Love Your family more, love the present moment more.

At noon, listen to mother-in-law said cotton has improved, can go out activities. Mother-in-law knows I am curious, also relayed the cause and effect of cotton illness. She had a cold (most likely from her younger brother) a week before, and when she came to Yang City hospital, the onset of coronavirus pneumonia, the hospital did not dare to be careless, and immediately took chest films and blood. It was just pneumonia, so I went home, and I went to the hospital to get an IV every day. The reason why the delay until today, because cotton did not take a good medicine. The family gave her cough Syrup and so on medicine, she all quietly poured out.

Soon Mian Mian came to play with his niece, I asked her where she poured. Said Mian Mian, and fell on the mosquito-repellent incense tray at the foot of the bed. I asked her if she was pouring, and she wouldn't say.

I found the diary objective and not overly emotional. But many friends because read my diary, think I am not in good condition, let me take care. Yunnan's Zhang Yanchao called to ask me the situation, I answered one by one. He is a policeman in Shuifu, Yunnan Province. When we spoke on the phone, he stopped a car at a highway junction to take the body temperature of the returning people.

I got a call from a friend of Heaven's Gate, Xiao Hu. We talk longer because we commute together. She was not in good health, so she paid special attention this time. Go home after strict isolation, mental strain is the result of feeling particularly sensitive to their own: these two days always want to cough, just "want" it, can endure. I said it must be psychosomatic. She did not agree, saying that she was injured, but that the respiratory system was fine. He said he was thirsty the day before yesterday and drank about 30 bottles of mineral water in two days. She wasn't worried about infection (she had enough protection from previous injuries) , but about becoming a source of infection and inflicting pain on her family.

His wife's colleague, Xi'er, was in Japan at the time. On January 16, she took annual leave, took the children and the mother-in-law out, and was scheduled to fly back on the 25th. China Eastern was grounded and had to change the flight schedule to February 9th and return via Shanghai. There are still more than ten days, Tokyo is too cold, they turn to Okinawa, as a holiday extension. When I talked to Xi'er, she said she had avoided the siege of Wuhan perfectly. In Japan, she said, the feeling of being adrift May Not Be Much better than in Wuhan. Most of her wanderings came from her confusion about when to return home. I bought the tickets for February 9th, but it's still a question of whether I'll be back on time. She was also worried about being quarantined when she landed in Shanghai. I thought of how people in Wuhan were treated in other provinces recently and asked her how she felt in Japan. She typed back, temporarily changing her voice, saying there was no mandatory quarantine in Japan and no special treatment for Wuhan residents.

I don't see much news today, because people from Wuhan (Hubei Province) are everywhere shouting about fighting in other places, and I really don't want to see it. But you can't hide from it. A friend circle a division younger sister encountered this. In Xuancheng, Anhui Province, her downstairs car was posted on the Internet by a netizen. "Xuancheng Headline" even copied and forwarded it. "These Wuhan guys, get out of Xuancheng, " one person commented

H, who went to Shandong on the 21st, was particularly quiet these two days. When I showed him my diary yesterday, he just answered, "who has no difficulty? ". Wuhan people in the treatment of the field, I wanted to ask him how he felt, but later thought he is back to his mother-in-law's house, and did not drive, probably not exposed. Today, out of the blue, he told me that he had been through something extraordinary.

He returned to Shandong on the 21st, and did not go to his mother-in-law's house, but in isolation at his wife's cousin's house. Shandong is strict in screening people from Wuhan to Shandong, with 69,180 people identified, the News said yesterday. H and his wife, right here in the 69180. To 25, H suddenly fever, was sent to the Jining Medical College Affiliated Hospital, was admitted to the negative pressure ward. The air pressure in the negative pressure ward is lower than the air pressure outside the ward. The fresh air outside the ward can flow into the ward so that the air polluted by the patients inside the ward will not leak out. This is serious. CT, blood work, throat swabs, standard procedure. At one point, he had a fever of 39.4. The doctor gave him a fever-reducing needle and woke up the next day with a fever of 37.7. That long, hard day, he almost thought he was infected. Negative pressure room noise, he began to sleep very poor, and then used to noise, and sleep very deep. I was woken up several times by the nurse.

His experience reminds me of Xu Zhen. Xu Zhen is in high fever during the friend circle, let us panic. However, H said his encounter with "special magic" , is the test results came out, is not a virus infection, but infected with chickenpox.

A man in his 30s was infected with chicken pox. I felt amazing afterwards. During the incident, when the whole country was in a state of panic, I don't know how h survived. I probably remember him consoling Yang Chen before he went into the hospital, when Yang Chen told the group that her husband had a fever and that he had a fever. On the 25th, we talked for a long time in the group, he said only "in isolation at home" , no more words; a little after four o'clock, when he had a high fever, he talked to me, he asked: "When can Wuhan Return? " I said: "A month to ensure the end, hurry to the parents-in-law to pay living expenses

Xu Zhen has been stable, he sent a circle of friends reported safe. Said he was a mild case of the disease, before their own excessive fear of their own, resulting from extreme tension and fear. Look at the GPS on his friendagenda. He's out of the hospital.

1 something 29, the fifth day. Isolation Day nine.

Yesterday diary said Xu Zhen has left the hospital back to school, should be unharmed. Shortly after 5 a.m. , he began posting his thoughts about the virus on his facebook page: homologous viruses, genetic bugs, and so on. There are a lot of professional expressions involved (which may seem professional) , but the problem is that he's a phd student, but he's a liberal arts major. He said something similar the other day before his fever spiked.

I hope he's okay.

The only infected person I know is Xu Zhen. As for Friends of friends, neighbors, colleagues, infected more. Mixed with joys and sorrows, it is far away. These two days I have been able to restrain themselves, not to see those separation, no loss. I made an excuse for myself: We had never met, and probably never will, so I assumed the dead were still there. This is indeed the time of self-relief, it seems to be powerless self-anesthesia.

At noon, Captain Zheng Yutang went door-to-door for the third time, putting up notices from door to door. Before is the red proposal, this is an open letter, and has a specific target: "returnees. ". The letter was mild in tone, saying only that anyone returning from or having stayed in Wuhan would need to be quarantined for two weeks. The letter was posted door to door, in fact, it is equivalent to the abolition of the directionality, unlike some places outside the province, only in front of the Returnees Hang Banners. Back at the gate, the radio said that the open letter had sent out 2,500 copies in Qianjiang, compared with 25,000 copies of the previous proposal.

Mother-in-law said the village was closed today. When Zheng Yutang posted the open letter, I asked him about the road closure. He said it was a "Spontaneous Act" by the people and that there was no notice from the village. In the afternoon I wore a mask and rode my bike to what my mother-in-law called a roadblock. It was just a few plastic stakes, not the pile of rocks or mud I had imagined.

Video-chatting with my mother, she mentioned that my brother's supermarket was going out of business years later. Sold, are rice, grain and oil and these are not eager to sell; New Year gift boxes, almost all placed did not move. This is to be expected, for the people of the small town, most of the consumption is not just need, but on the face of consumption. If visiting relatives and friends, to do a good meal, snack fruit can not be less; a family stay at home, food and clothing costs on everything from the simple.

Mother-in-law's home is so, if everything is normal, the third day of the first lunar month because it is grandma's birthday, the family to feast guests, little had to go out shopping. Now the garden at the door will do just about anything. When my wife took a walk in the garden with a stream, she told her about the things in the garden: Flowering Cabbage, cabbage, radish, rape, Chrysanthemum Chrysanthemum, lettuce. And then there are the wild vegetables in the fields.

Xi'er, who is stranded in Japan, joined a Japanese-chinese self-help group today. Her flight home via Shanghai on the 9th was canceled. It is said that 180 people can charter a plane back to Wuhan, another group of "Wuhan Street Children in Japan" experience. The best option offered by the group was to contact the embassy and fly directly to Wuhan. The next best thing was to land in Changsha, then take the high-speed train to Wuhan and try to get off at Wuhan.

In the afternoon, received Wuhan Traffic Police SMS. A notice relating to order 9. Private car owners are reminded not to take part in the prevention and control of the epidemic, not to take part in the protection of people's livelihood, not to see a doctor or work, life urgent need to use motor vehicles, shall not be allowed to drive on the road. But there is room: "other really urgent, can first pass, and then by the community or unit issued a certificate. "

Before going to bed, see the decision of Provincial Control Headquarters: All kinds of enterprises in the province back to work no earlier than February 13 at 24:00. I'M GONNA be in Qianjiang for at least another two weeks. The Creek's in dire need of diapers and formula, so we're GONNA have to go downtown for supplies.

Data: 5,997 cases were diagnosed in China. 132 deaths. There were 3,554 cases in Hubei, up 840 yesterday.

1-30. Sixth Day. Quarantine Day 10.

Another one of my friends got it.

Yesterday I was saying that only Xu Zhen was infected. And I have no contact with Xu Zhen, so these days worry only out of the concern of friends, not as a contact of panic.

My new infected friend, unlike Xu Zhen, whom I had met before returning to Qianjiang on the 21st. If the new pneumonia is suspended in the head of the dark clouds, just cover, just oppression, today, the clouds finally have rain fall, drop on the body, inevitable, no luck.

I've been in isolation for ten days, so let's hope nothing happens in the next few days. This friend is usually in good health, I hope he can be the same as Xu Zhen, but mild illness, safe and sound.

At noon, my father-in-law called the neighbors to play Mahjong. Hanging out at the door before the fight. A GRANDPA who said Mian Mian had caught a cold playing Mahjong the day before yesterday. He hasn't been served these days. One said it was useless, uncomfortable, and suffocating. When they were served, everyone stood back and watched.

I'm GonNa go upstairs and talk to my wife, and I'm GonNa see if I can get this table out of here. My wife shook her head and said, I can't do it. My father can't listen to me. I carried the creek downstairs and stood behind my father-in-law, first half joking that these days you do not pay attention to AH. Father-in-law said: Do not what kind of do Oh, no matter. I couldn't help but shout my wife's name to the upstairs, and then go outside to shout my wife's sister. "You two go take care of your father. " I am probably more serious, the voice is not small, the wife did not come down, the wife sister and mother-in-law are coming. Finally got the table out of the way.

After lunch, Captain Cheng came over to hand out masks. One bag, eight, disposable surgical masks. Manufactured in Qianjiang by Kang Hyuk Medical Materials Ltd. . A family a bag, counting up, Diao Temple a team of nearly a thousand, if it is distributed throughout the city, the number is very large.

Wuhan, where I live in the community also confirmed the infection. Before the property has been a "we are not afraid" of self-confidence in the group release of News, today's news, finally have a trace of vulnerability and weakness. The first sentence is: Please forgive us, we can not maintain high quality of service.

The reasons are as follows: The city was closed on the 23rd, causing some employees to be unable to go to work; at present, Hubei Province has been completely sealed off, many employees can not return to Wuhan to work; the resignation of the cleaning master, leading to the maintenance of cleaning work can not be normal; Wuhan once again issued a "motor vehicle ban" No. 9 notice, a number of staff can not be normal to work, and stay in the project staff physical load and psychological stress, but also need rest and shift change.

I have always had a good feeling for residential property, usually they can be considered considerate. To send such an open letter, you can imagine their frustration. Everyone in the homeowners'association has shown understanding. It's not the weakness of the property, it's the weakness of the city. How can a neighborhood be safe when a city is screaming for help?

Qianjiang today also issued a traffic control order No. 5: From 10:00 today, traffic control measures for motor vehicles and electric vehicles will be implemented on roads in the city center and towns and villages of Qianjiang, and physical isolation and blocking management will be implemented on major access roads.

Data: 1032 new cases were confirmed in Hubei yesterday. Wuhan 356. The rest are in the counties and cities. Huanggang and Xiaogan were the worst affected areas, with 172 and 125, respectively. So far, there have been 7,830 cases in China and 4,586 in Hubei.

1-31, seventh day of Quarantine, day 11.

Yesterday, when I heard that my colleague was infected, I paid more attention to my body reaction. Last night before going to bed to the throat, muscles, first-class all the known symptoms of organs, all over again, only feel a little dizzy, presumably due to tension, did not wake up in the morning.

More than 9,800 people in the country have been infected. Wuhan 5806, yesterday added 1,220.

Yesterday, the CDC paper, Huanggang Health Commission Director Brush Screen; Today's turn of the Red Cross. From the first "trip" , to KN95 written as N95, to the date written wrong. It's ironic. No, it's outrageous.

The radio car in the village stopped broadcasting the pithy formula today. Just tell everyone not to gather. Tell them there's been an infection in town. The tone on the radio was not the same as it used to be. It worked. No one's playing cards in the village today. My father-in-law was so bored that he took a nap at noon.

I had a scary nap yesterday (I thought it would boost my immune system) , but I won't be able to sleep today. Contact typesetting, cover design, topic number, and so on. Afternoon Chengdu Business Newspaper interview to do a special topic, I think I have no particularity, but also have no shame to refuse. During the chat, I came up with a word to describe my recent state: Split. On the one hand is the plain (and perhaps a little sweet) daily life, on the other hand is the sad, absurd, angry news from afar. The disillusion, the unreality, that I was talking about before, probably comes from this division.

Write something warm.

Take the creek out for a walk in the evening. All along the road are sweet-scented Osmanthus trees, I hold her to the first, she reached out to touch the leaves, pointing to the next, Mouth Hmmm non-stop. So I took her to the next tree, and she touched the leaves and kept pointing. Over and over, a dozen in a row. As I walked back, I picked a leaf she had touched and took it to her. I walked two steps to the next tree, where she would hold it up and put it there. Looks like he's putting the leaves back in. My Wife said the same thing happened to the creek in Wuhan. Always holding the falling branches and leaves, in front of the trees in the Pipera non-stop.

I wouldn't say it's the goodness of a child. It's just an instinct to keep things as they are.

NIECE DIARY: Today did not eat enough, see the moon is missing, as if did not eat full. It reminds me of the diary my niece wrote that day about the outbreak. One about my grandfather being in bad health and my mother not being able to see it (which I guess is an exaggeration, since my mother went home the first few days and didn't Miss it) ; the other about no one on the street and my brother's supermarket not doing well.

February 1, the eighth day. Isolation for twelve days.

A case was confirmed in my building in Wuhan.

Someone forwarded the news to the owner's group this morning, and it blew up. The first wave of demands was for the property to tell which floor and which apartment. "No discrimination, we want him to recover as soon as possible, but the family must be isolated at home to protect themselves, but also to protect others. " The group's property customer service said only "community notice notice, " she probably did not know which family. The crowd roared, blaming the industry for its failure. Then contact in recent days the community's various "NON-PROPERTY STATE" : Corridor Health did not do, guard booth closed, and so on. The property has issued a notice before, that can not continue to provide quality services, listed reasons, you can understand. Now found the knife hanging over his head, it can not be light and breezy. After blaming, and realized that special period, there are many things to property, so some people to placate, hope that the property to continue to do a good job in the elevator, stairway disinfection.

I'm not really in the middle of all this. In the middle of the group said a sentence, "now the key is not to announce which families have been infected, but to do a good job of protection, " nobody heeded. Some owners cite other communities as examples (listing room numbers, reviewing access routes) . Property response in the evening, mainly weak, said a few days, shortage of Manpower, materials, physical and mental fatigue. This is the truth, the owners these days, will not be unaware of, just feel the need to inform someone of the fact of infection earlier.

If I were still in Wuhan, I would probably be one of those angry and helpless neighbors. My downstairs neighbor, because the child is still small, this year decided not to go home for the new year, but also took over the grandparents. My grandparents brought two other grandchildren with them. A family of seven, since the day of the blockade, has not been locked out. Of course, the material is sufficient, long-term confinement, and do not know when to end, mental pressure can be imagined.

Chatting with my classmate H, I said: "We have a confirmed diagnosis in the building. " H said: "We have a building opposite, someone died today. " Storm, no one survived. The difference is simply that there are those who are parties and those who are bystanders.

My two infected friends. Xu Zhen is still convalescing, the friend of tecent net wants to invite him to write an article, he still asked me to write method today. Looks like you're in good shape. Another friend is out of town. To keep me in the dark. But no news is the best news.

Qianjiang is feeling a lot more pressure today because there were 15 new cases yesterday. My father-in-law didn't have a card game today. He was very upset. In the afternoon, Zheng Yutang came for the fifth time. He sent us two thermometers and asked us in detail how we got to Qianjiang. Finally, he asked us to provide the address of the residential area in Wuhan.

Today, the COVID-19 headquarters for the prevention and control of pneumonia in Hubei Province issued a circular. Article 4 says that anyone returning to Hubei to return to the Han people must apply to the city (state) , county (City, district) prevention and control headquarters of the city (prefecture) or community (village) to which they belong, return after approval.

It's kind of like an ultimatum. Work Notice said February 14th. If the prevention and control properly, probably can follow the notification operation. I can get a job application. What about people who don't have jobs? My mother, for example, and a large number of grandchildren like my mother, how do they return to Wuhan?

In the evening, facetime with your mother. Show her some of Brook's new skills. When we say "baby sticks, " she raises her hand; when we blow kisses. And the creek made it for grandma. My mother told me that my brother's supermarket will be closed tomorrow. All the supermarkets and commissaries in the town, except for the four large ones, will be closed. My mother had her grievances, but I felt good about it. There have been confirmed cases in Jingyang town, and one in Guandian town (where I was born) , which is more remote and I have always felt perfectly safe.

Last night, experts said Shuanghuanglian oral liquid can treat new pneumonia, so the whole people rush. It soon became a myth -- a myth, to be precise. Today, Shuanghuanglian time for the Red Cross or transfer part of the firepower. I saw the writer Terrigenous sediment say in friends circles that the reason Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was awarded was because he pointed out that the great famine was not caused by an absolute lack of food, but because the system level causes the food distribution not to be in the hands of the hungry people. Here's a photo of it.

DATA: 11,890 nationwide, up 2,099 from yesterday. Hubei 7153, up 1,347 from yesterday. A friend said it was time to look at the suspected cases and their growth. 17,988,2,750. How many of these will be diagnosed?

February 2nd, the Ninth Day. Isolation Day 13.

Last night, teacher Li Qi sent a wechat update, only this morning to see. When I posted my diary on the Public Account, I also meant to let you know I was safe. These two days did not push, because the friend circle information is excessive, keep a diary of people also rise. Plus, I don't think I've seen enough to be an example. When I called Li Qi to let her know I was okay, she replied, you're going to write it down whether you send it or not.

I first met Li Qi last year at a seminar for Lei Pingyang in Xishuangbanna, where we were in charge of booking tickets and sending text messages to communicate. At the 2019 East L. Poetry Festival, when she came to Wuhan, we met for the first time and she said my poems were very quiet, i, too, was touched by her kindness, reading at night and listening to her read and write her mother's poems; she sat with me at several dinners in Quanzhou in December, and took extra care of me because she knew I was allergic to seafood. She later said that one of the reasons for the care was that her daughter, Xiao Tao Ma, was also allergic.

I'll keep writing until I get back to Wuhan. What I want to do now is finish it in 14 days. It's Day 13. Before I said these words, is a personal window, the window is open to others, but also to their own, as Li Qi said: "for the future. "

As an analogy to SARS, my only memories are the closed gates of Enshi High School, the lack of clothes in the spring and summer, and finally one weekend when I got carsick on the way from Ensch to Guandian town in a van, every now and then... at that time, I may have felt the urgency, but now, it is not clear. More details, which were not recorded then (nor in the first year of high school) , are now in oblivion. This coronavirus, with these journals in existence, will allow me to imagine what it is today, many years from now.

These days, I don't write poetry, I don't even think about it, there are ethical considerations, there are habits, there are abilities, there's chaos, there's chaos, it takes time to see. A step further seems to be the limit of poetry. At its heart, poetry is personal, emotional; the demands of the individual are personal, and I'm on the edge of a storm; the demands of emotional independence (or at least autonomy) , and the month of grief, tragedy, and lies have been emotional, too emotional, you don't feel anything.

The words I'm writing now are like a photograph. I just press the shutter again and again to record the fleeting moments before my eyes.

Keep taking pictures. It's a rainy day. I'm stuck inside. Because of the road closure, several motorcycles were seen taking a short cut to come to the car, which was headed there without a mask. My sister-in-law and I said, the doorway path, should also get some warning signs, such as "Wuhan People here, be careful to avoid" and so on. When the rain stopped in the morning, my mother-in-law went this way to pick wild vegetables. The bridge was Great road. Although there was little traffic, we didn't dare to go any further. We were afraid of the virus in the air. This kind of caution is probably my portrayal these days.

The Brook is already a scoundrel. After a nap, I wake up full of steam; something unpleasant, to feel as if I were going to wallow in it is the thing I dislike most. In Wuhan, there was a hill's encyclopedia of child rearing, with detailed instructions on how to treat children at each stage. This more than 10 days, did not read a book, Several Times said that the Internet search, each time was attracted by the epidemic. I am more calm, parents-in-law said good-natured, the truth is not enough effort, more is to enjoy the lovely brook. Mothers, on the other hand, enjoy being cute and don't miss being obnoxious. So his wife sometimes to the brook temper impulse, but a pity did not send out, just his anger back upstairs, said it is to "accumulate love. ".

After dinner, the chickens and ducks come back to their cages, and we take the creek to see it. A dozen chickens, gathered outside the cage, went in one by one. Mother-in-law said the coop a dark, the hen step by step test, so walk not fast, the rooster is very worried, craned his neck hurry. The stream seemed to hurry, too, with its mouth full and its hands gesticulating and its feet stamping. It's been so long since I've seen a chicken or a duck in a cage, and I saw a lot of them when I was a kid. In those days the parlour of the house was called in the vernacular "pit of fire" , for there was a fire, and a large cellar for the furnace to ventilate. This cellar, is the winter chickens sleep in bed, every evening, they crowded in the door, I opened the door, the chickens filed in. At night, as we sat by the fire, we could still hear the clatter of chickens below us.

I'm never gonNA see that again. But it is a comfort from the past to see chickens and ducks return to their cages.

Today, Wuhan issued a No. 10 Order: "confirmed patients centralized admission, suspected patients centralized isolation, fever patients, close contacts centralized isolation observation. " This is called four categories of personnel. The suspected patient was quarantined, which the public had been clamoring for. The government has called for home segregation as a stopgap measure, as if there were no place for it. What we're doing is converting the hotel into a temporary quarantine zone, a centralized quarantine. "In order to effectively prevent family aggregation of sexual infection, shall not be isolated at home. ".

The handling of suspected cases should mean that the government has more than its share of muscle, which is the real good news these days. Personally, the good news is, I don't know anyone new infected in the last two days.

Of course there's a lot of bad news. A news report said there was an airborne infection in Inner Mongolia: The two patients were not in close contact and were separated by a building. Maybe it's not so mysterious. Maybe it's just close contact. In other news, experts have found viral nucleic acids in the stool and anal swabs of infected people, suggesting possible "faecal-oral transmission. ". From droplets to contact, to fecal matter, there may be other routes of transmission in the future.

Finally, the data are presented as usual. Nationwide, 14,492 cases were diagnosed, up 2,701 from yesterday, and Hubei 9704, up 1,921. There were eight more cases in Qianjiang, bringing the total to 35.

February 3rd, the 10th. The 14th day of Quarantine.

Last Day of isolation at home.

Isolation at home is unscientific, especially in the countryside, where there is little mobility but few neighbours. I came back on the 21st, and by the 23rd I was isolated, but it was still hard to be completely isolated from my family, just trying not to go out. The village also knew that the neighbor walks inevitably, the propaganda vehicle comes, said walks does not surpass "next door three families" . Neighbors know each other well enough to trust each other.

These days, life is pretty much self-sufficient. In the morning, the mother-in-law found no ginger, father-in-law riding a motorcycle out, the village did not come back to be stopped. The neighbors backed up half a piece of ginger, which should last about three or four days. Ginger is not a necessity. It doesn't matter if you don't eat it. Said the creek diaper tension, the day before yesterday, Yang City's mother and baby store door-to-door, enough to use for a month.

China's elderly couple in Singapore's state-of-the-art heated heated heated space. The letter stressed that the elderly immunity is poor, more to go out less. This is only one reason, another reason, may be the elderly information block, do not understand what is happening now. Even if I did, it would be mostly half-baked. The grandma of the home understands to epidemic situation more detailed these days, every time exclamation: "really be harmful person! "

The family's understanding of the epidemic is very simple, the older generation, in fact, less concerned about the above reaction speed, WHO's decision-making judgment, only concerned about the number of confirmed cases, how many people died. When my mother-in-law heard about the bird flu in Hunan, she said, "well, I wish more chickens would die. " When I asked why, my mother-in-law said, "more dead chickens, less dead people. " She meant it.

In Wuhan, the unrest continues. Neighbors put forward two points: First, the community on the diagnosis of nine patients with the family whether to do professional elimination? Two, according to our city prevention and Control Headquarters 10 orders, close contacts also concentrated isolation, the community has 9 close contacts concentrated isolation?

The community responded that it was not possible to carry out professional killing of patients, such as if someone in the family had died, and that there were three conditions for the centralized isolation of close contacts, the contact person is able to take care of himself, has no underlying medical history (chronic disease) , and goes voluntarily. At present, a few members of his family have no symptoms, and to quarantine points are some fever patients, if to quarantine points, the family is unfair. "We are all neighbours, fighting the epidemic, not the patients. "

If the community had not kept the patient's room number secret, it would probably not be a group discussion, but a protest outside the patient's door. The neighbors'demands are understandable, but the property's defense is also valid. The disagreement, involving the Operability, specifically the separation of close contacts, is likely to be reported later.

2,800 more confirmed today. Hubei added nearly 2,100.

Around 3:00 p.m. Ate a pear, went upstairs suddenly unwell. Took a half-hour nap, went downstairs, took a break, went to the bathroom and threw up. We had a bowl of porridge for dinner. Keep vomiting and diarrhea. Temperature, 36.5.

Guess why. One, allergies. I'm allergic to eggs, but I haven't been on a diet lately. But previous allergic reactions in the gastrointestinal tract, rarely vomiting. Two, it's infected. Vomiting, poor appetite, and diarrhea are uncommon, but present, symptoms of neocoronary pneumonia.

Is it finally my turn?

My father-in-law gave me a bag of Norfloxacin. I looked it up and didn't dare eat it. 9:00. Go downstairs and get a surgical mask. Wear it to bed. Get a thermometer and take your temperature at all times. There's a little salt in the glass, and then a sip of water. My wife did all the work, and I stayed in bed, Abandon, watching my sleeping daughter. He said to his wife, if this continues tomorrow, he will go to the hospital.

Before going to bed, to assist the hospital's public on-line questions, filled in a pile of information, inadvertently out. When you resubmit, you will be prompted to ask only one question. I took care of a few more work issues, put my phone away, go to sleep, we'll talk about tomorrow.
