The train stopped at Wuhan Station. The door did not open right away. Rey was tense and his mind was blank. About 30 seconds later, the door opened. Rey ran out of the car and ran to the exit. In the empty waiting square, someone shouted, "We're home at last! It's so hard out there! "

This is the eighth day of the "city closure" in Wuhan. Rui returned from his hometown to Wuhan, where the ticket terminates in another city, and the train will make a brief stop at Wuhan Station, according to the route taken before the outbreak. It's all a mystery now. Rey was nervous all the way. If the door does not open, she will be driven to a strange city; if the door opens, it means that she will spend the epidemic period in Wuhan without the company of her relatives.

The decision was made because the family cat was in Wuhan waiting for Rey to return. Many left Wuhan with no idea that a major outbreak was already under way. After the siege, pets stayed at home in Wuhan, their lives counting down as water and food ran out, forcing them to examine how much they could spend to save their tiny lives.

And they themselves are subject to scrutiny and measurement. In the panic of the epidemic, their intersection with the city of Wuhan made them outliers marginalized by the population. "Life needs to be treated as an equal, " he said, preferring to spend time with his pet rather than being isolated at home

Like a net, "closing the city" , "closing the roads" and various measures to fight against the epidemic have taken up the overall situation of "people's lives are at stake" , while the omission and fall of tiny individuals often need to be salvaged by people in the same situation, their destinies are in reference to each other.

Retrograde motion

On New Year's Eve, Rey had only one thought in mind: I want to go back to Wuhan.

It's almost impossible to move. Around 2:00 am on January 23, Wuhan officially announced the "closure" of the city, the temporary closure of the city from Han passage. At 10:00 am that day, the railway authorities closed all railway station access in Wuhan. After the "closure" , the story of escaping from Wuhan often appeared in the press, but Rui more and more want to go back.

Before leaving Wuhan, she left her cat at home, asking a friend to take care of it. The House is also equipped with an automatic water dispenser, a feeding machine, a camera and other equipment. The sudden outbreak and closure of the city extended the holiday, disrupting her original schedule. She called the pet store downstairs to feed the cat. A few days later, the pet store owner told her that the cat had become upset, had knocked over things in the house, and was exhibiting unusual behavior.

Rey had a hunch that the outbreak would not end in 10 days and a half months, and in those few days the policy had changed and changed, and she was worried about leaving the cat unattended for too long. "If the cat gets sick and I don't get back in time, I'm going to regret it. "

Rui wasn't the only one who wanted to go back to Wuhan to take care of her pet. She found cat friends in a cat group who had the same idea. After discussion, they made two plans: If classes of high-speed trains passing through Wuhan would still stop at Wuhan Station, then they can rush off between stops; alternatively, a few people head for the surrounding city, then hitch a ride back to Wuhan.

Rui was lucky enough to buy a high-speed train through Wuhan, get off the train, and charter a ride home with several cat friends at the Wuhan Station. Some of the group simply cycled dozens of kilometers back to the city from Huangpi District, Ezhou and other places around Wuhan, for the cats.

Cats are not the only driving force behind this retrograde behaviour. Rae's home town is known for its "hard core" preparedness, and her neighborhood has been plastered with posters. As soon as she got home, Rey put herself in isolation. She hid in the house when the family came. She didn't want anyone to know that she had come back from Wuhan, "My friends were afraid to talk to me when they found out I was back, and some joked about turning me in. "

This "special treatment" Made Rey feel unfair. She would rather go back to Wuhan and stay with the cat, "You are good to people, and people are not always good to you. But if you're nice to your cat, he's really nice to you. You may not want your cat to give you anything in return, but cats can sometimes surprise you. At least it's comforting to come home to them."

Cats left behind in Wuhan

Those who remain in Wuhan can relate to the differential treatment they suffer in the field as a result of being labelled "Wuhan" .

Pet shop owner Zhou Mo originally planned to take his dog Akita to Yunnan on January 22, the dog's life span is only more than 10 years, Zhou Mo wanted to let the dog see more scenery. The city had not yet been sealed off, but Zhong Nanshan had made it clear that COVID-19 pneumonia spread from person to person. He was afraid of causing trouble to others, so he cancelled the trip. "You can't even go out and cough. When you cough, people get scared. "

Zhou Mo family economic conditions are not bad, open a pet shop is not to make big money, but to take care of his more than a dozen cats and dogs. Three years after opening the store, Zhou watched some pets grow up and some guests settle down. The pets became a connection between people and people. "I have a long relationship with both people and pets here, so the store has to go on. "

Bus Stop, private car ban, travel is not only trouble, but also the risk of infection. Zhou Mo every day by motorcycle door-to-door delivery, the farthest round trip each 40 kilometers. In the face of the epidemic, dogs have no food to eat, cats also need not cat litter, for Zhou Mo is still important. "people who don't have pets are less likely to understand our feelings. "

Not everyone understands this sort of value ranking, and in the panic of an epidemic, some vulnerable groups are negligible or even expendable. According to netizens, some pets were taken away and buried deep during the period of isolation, while others were suspected to have been thrown from upstairs. Images on the Internet show that Nehe, Heilongjiang and other places have decided to hunt and kill stray cats and dogs to prevent and control the epidemic.

"discrimination" was a word Zhou repeatedly used, either to express his concern about animals: "Many people are already prejudiced against animals, and this outbreak is also related to wild animals. People who don't know the truth may just listen to the wind. "

Or to say that the attitude of outsiders to the people of Wuhan today is, "I can see the news all day and night that Wuhan people are discriminated against in other places. You can't do that, okay? We actually made a great sacrifice. "

Mutual Aid

January 25, the first day of the Lunar New Year. Two kittens and a dog died in Zhou Mo's pet shop.

This morning, Wuhan new pneumonia prevention and Control Headquarters issued a notice No. 9, announced 26 from 0:00, except for permitted vehicles, the central area of the motor vehicle ban management. "Road closures" not only stop traffic, but also cut off many lives from the outside world. "Don't say cats and dogs, if there are old people living alone, no one to send food may also starve to death. "

In a race for time, Chou panicked. He and an employee took care of the two stores, which each took four or five hours to deal with day-to-day tasks such as shoveling, feeding and walking the dogs. "Road closure" disrupted the work arrangements, he thought of the second store foster pets less, let the staff to take care of a store, himself rushed out to deliver goods.

I've been out all night. When he came back in the evening, he wanted to stock up on some vegetables, but when he got there, he found that there was only meat left in the supermarket. Zhou Mo ran for a day, too tired to talk, also did not have time to go to the store to see, the result of the three small animals on the line. "It was our responsibility, but we were really forced to do it, and we didn't think it was going to be like this. "

"Road closure" makes rescue of left-behind pets more urgent. Also on the 25th, there were more and more messages asking for help from the wechat backstage of the Wuhan Zoological Association. The person in charge, Du Fan, felt that there could be no hesitation now. "At a critical juncture, we must uphold this responsibility. "

"Why spread the virus everywhere? " "people can't control it, but what about the cat? " Wuhan Small Animal Protection Association is the only Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau for the record, with a "legal status" of civil aid organizations. Their day-to-day rescue of stray animals is often misunderstood. The voices of doubt grew louder in the wake of the outbreak.

Stray dogs on the streets of Wuhan

Saving a cat is a big deal for a member of the association, Xun. On January 31, Du Fan and Schoenberg saved a black cat, Schoenberg elder brother through this experience "the most uncomfortable and most excited mood ever. ".

The cat is indeed difficult to save, after saved the Xun elder brother to have the sense of accomplishment specially. He was trapped on the 15th floor balcony, wedged between the window and the bars, and could fall at any moment from exhaustion. The stray cat couldn't get through the door downstairs, and when word got around that "pets can get new pneumonia, " Schoenberg knew right away: It was a house cat that had been thrown out the door.

In order to save the cat, Du Fan went to the roof, foot on the edge of the fence, upper body out of the fence, throw a rope to catch the cat, stand in the corridor, with a clothes pole supporting the cat to meet.

But a cat can jump into a room if a 15th floor resident is willing to open the window. The owner won't talk, says he's got two kids at home. The cat was rescued, the window was opened, and the owner kept spraying the windowsill with a bottle of disinfectant. "As a mother who wanted to protect her children, she only chose to believe what she thought was right, " he said, trying to understand the owner's behavior, but still feeling aggrieved, "They still have a good family sign on their door. Why do they just refuse to communicate? "

There are many criteria for assessing the value of an animal's life, such as whether it is a threat, domesticated or nomadic, such as breed, lineage, and price. Some dogs are used for racing, some for eating. Even actions driven by love or kindness often rank alongside certain values and become more prominent in outbreaks.

Many people also withhold information in order to give their pets priority for rescue. Du Fan in the mind is not very comfortable, "hope everybody can honestly say, give more pets an equal rescue opportunity" . There is also a disregard for others, "Mingming people in Wuhan, two stops away from the cat house, he was afraid of being infected, said there are old people and children, they do not let us go, I do not know what his heart is thinking. "

Well, it's not just about someone or something. "If we don't save these cats and dogs, they may really die at home and cause a second spread of disease, " said Du, who often uses the excuse to persuade residential properties to let them pass through, which are under strict control, it's often because there's already a confirmed case.

But it can be about caring for one another. When Fan Lina returned home from Wuhan on Jan. 19, she took her cat with her, and after settling her cat, she started worrying about other people's cats and helping wechat groups collect information about rescue efforts. "I want my cat to be good, and I want all cats to be good. "

At 8 pm on the 25th, four hours before the road closure, Fan Lina received a call from a group of friends who said they were in Qingshan District, Wuhan and wanted to get the cat back from the Valley of Light. It was already hard to find a car. Fan Lina remembered a neighbor who had recently volunteered to pick up and drop off medical staff, and contacted him to help. By the time the driver picked up the cat, it was 10:40 p.m. To the community downstairs, the security guard stopped the master at the door. Fan Lina and his friends took turns calling and pleading, and finally got the cat out.

The Standard is established by man and transferred by his will. Zhang Xun, the owner of the pet hospital, found that there were many stray dogs on the streets of Wuhan, and many breeds of dogs were also abandoned. "A lot of people still think of pets as fun and don't value a dog's life. "

Zhang Xun's hospital, which opened last year, is not yet profitable and is estimated to take two years to recoup its investment. The "interim measures for the prevention and control of COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan" issued on January 29 ordered pet shop hospitals to suspend business. Zhang Xun's store is closed to the public, but there will be staff left behind, hoping to meet the animals in need of first aid can also be saved. Some do not need the basic treatment of complex equipment, Zhang Xun drove to the door, "a lot of people call over, can run we must run. "

Before opening the pet shop, Zhang Xun had spent five or six years of his spare time doing rescue work for stray animals. Back then, it was more about going to the market and competing with the dog traders, and if it wasn't there, the dogs would be slaughtered. Arguing, fighting, people throwing knives if they have to. Zhang Xun also knows that their rescue is in the middle of nowhere, but there is no domestic animal protection law.

"when conflicts break out, they have to rely on their own initiative and find their own way to resolve them. "

Overdraft

Money is now one of the few things that can be counted in the long-term predictable fight against disease and unpredictable policy changes.

For pet owners in Wuhan, the original Spring Festival period foster care week, the cost is only about 500 yuan, as the holiday extension, foster care has become a bottomless pit. Looking for someone to feed, the cost of each time mostly also want 100 yuan above, this still does not calculate to pick a lock fee and fare.

Fan Lina had been active in the rescue group for several days, and when one of the girls in the group said that her cat had only five days of food left, she helped contact the locksmith and the cat man.

After the closure, the price of a door-to-door lock in Wuhan rose to 300-800 yuan. After hearing the master's offer, the girl did not reply to Fan Lina's message. A few days later, Fan Lina suddenly found that the girl was still hesitating in the group, saying that the cat had run out of water, but she wanted to wait until she ran out of food before asking someone to open the lock. Fan Lina angrily deleted the girl. "She's not worried. What am I worried about? "

Pet stores are also caught in a never ending cycle of consumption. Two or three people have not returned Zhang's messages, the original foster care has expired, they have not paid off. "If you go home for one week during the New Year, the cost will be 500 or 600 yuan. Now, you don't know how long you will be in foster care. It may be 3000 or 4000 yuan per month. "

There aren't many pet stores that can offer door-to-door service. Zhou estimates that a third of pet stores in Wuhan will not survive the year. His daily expenses, such as rent and wages, cost 7,000 yuan, and his account barely lasted two months. The private tenants of the mall have pulled together a group, looking for a way to get subsidies or rent relief, Zhou Mo know in his heart, not hope.

Something like this has already been answered in Zhou Mo's experience. Now, for example, if you don't have a mask, you have to go out and buy one, but the relevant department also stipulates that you must wear a mask when you go out. And last year, they asked for a dog license, but the big dogs were fined without a license, and then they were refused a license after being fined. Zhou mused, only one sentence with emotion, "if the leadership also like the dog. "

The survival of pets left behind will be more critical, but fewer and fewer people may be able to devote their energies to saving them. Ivan is one of the founders of Wuhan Native Cat, a nongovernmental relief organization. According to Ivan, they have resolved more than 400 requests for help, including through group support, but they are still too weak. Over the past two days, Ivan and others in the group have been told to work from home.

Du Thought that only about 50 families really needed home help. But on the 26th, the day the Wuhan Small Animal Protection Association's article was published, the backstage immediately received more than 300 messages asking for help. Now, the association has helped 400 families, and more than 500 families are still registered and waiting to be solved.

At present, they have two staff members responsible for collating help information, processing background data, and six volunteers, two groups, respectively, home to Hankou, Wuchang, Hanyang, three left-behind animal rescue. Not Enough people, they also set up a mutual help group, let the help themselves in the group docking related resources. "I can't do it, " Du said.

Moreover, under the sense of urgency of "saving lives" , different people have different understandings of how to save and what is "saving lives" .

After the outbreak of the disease, the old cat is one of the most rapid response to the rescue needs of civil rescuers. January 25th, this is an emergency push | cats left in Wuhan, do you have enough food and water? Call us -- or else it will be too late -- as we offer door to door pick up service, it's been read more than 100,000 times in a short time.

A girl saw this article, paid foster care and road fees, let the old cat in their home in Wuhan cats back to foster. Later, she found out that the cat would sell the cat after the rescue. She contacted the cat and hoped that he would send a video or a photo of the cat every day. The cat called angrily, "since you think I might sell your cat for money, let's talk about money. 300 Yuan is not enough for the road, and now Wuhan is closed and it's 500 yuan to go out and do anything. "

The cat later admitted that he was too tired and exhausted to keep his sanity that day. But the trust is broken, the girl asked the cat to return the cat, and the cat busy rescue, ask each other to take the cat away, the two people do not give in, "closure" "road closure" let things further deadlock.

Water and food for the cat from the rescuers

The cat is a controversial figure in the Wuhan Cat Circle, accused of "carrying a breed of cat to save" , "selling cats under the banner of saving cats" , and poor foster care conditions for cats infected with cat plague. But the cat believes that he has adopted a commercial model, through the rescue money to maintain the long-term relief, "let the hungry cat a little less. ". During this period of time, the cat said he had solved nearly 200 information for help, home feeding charges 200 yuan each time, foster 50 yuan a day, at the same time, according to the situation to collect gas and unlock the cost.

He is more efficient, but also overdrawing his personal capacity to save "life" at the cost of greater losses. At least in the sacrifice of a "small part" , which is no longer measured by the gain and loss of simple addition and subtraction.

Zheng Zhen was once a supporter of the cat, but within days his attitude to the cat quickly turned to disgust. Her friend picked up a stray cat years ago and put it in the care of an old cat. This let Zheng Zhen to the old cat impression is very good, in the rescue group almost one-sided scold old old cat, insisted on the old cat speak. Group friends questioned why the old cat did not refute rumors about his "black material" , Zheng Zhen asked, "is it important to clarify or save the cat important? "

Friends back home after the New Year has been self-isolation, depressed, too late to follow up on the situation of the kitten. When contacted again, the friend was told that the cat had died the day after it was delivered, and the cat said that she had been too busy with the rescue to inform her. "If I had known about him earlier, if we had been more vigilant, if we had asked him earlier, maybe the cat would still be alive and well. I will never forget the lesson of losing my life. Again, I am sorry. " Zheng Zhen left a long list of apologies in the help group, out of the group chat.

Aid is a kindness to the weak and small, but that kindness is being tortured more. Though torture may not need to exist.

More pets are being abandoned and more stray animals are in danger, but Zhang has less on hand to help. In the past, most of the active rescuers were blocked by the epidemic at home, Zhang Xun understand, now self-preservation is the first priority, can not engage in moral kidnapping. Like himself, the scope of his ability is no more than a circle around his pet hospital, and the radius is shrinking because of traffic restrictions and strict community control. "It takes time for the environment to change. It takes the whole society to participate. One or two people is not enough. "

That said, Zhang Xun or do not want to let himself idle down, and signed up for the area of the anti-epidemic volunteers, "can do how much do it, even to move a brick. "

Zhang Xun is most worried about the stray animals. The pets that remain are watched, and in more remote corners, more strays remain in silence, unknown.

Retrograde motion

On New Year's Eve, Rey had only one thought in mind: I want to go back to Wuhan.

It's almost impossible to move. Around 2:00 am on January 23, Wuhan officially announced the "closure" of the city, the temporary closure of the city from Han passage. At 10:00 am that day, the railway authorities closed all railway station access in Wuhan. After the "closure" , the story of escaping from Wuhan often appeared in the press, but Rui more and more want to go back.

Before leaving Wuhan, she left her cat at home, asking a friend to take care of it. The House is also equipped with an automatic water dispenser, a feeding machine, a camera and other equipment. The sudden outbreak and closure of the city extended the holiday, disrupting her original schedule. She called the pet store downstairs to feed the cat. A few days later, the pet store owner told her that the cat had become upset, had knocked over things in the house, and was exhibiting unusual behavior.

Rey had a hunch that the outbreak would not end in 10 days and a half months, and in those few days the policy had changed and changed, and she was worried about leaving the cat unattended for too long. "If the cat gets sick and I don't get back in time, I'm going to regret it. "

Rui wasn't the only one who wanted to go back to Wuhan to take care of her pet. She found cat friends in a cat group who had the same idea. After discussion, they made two plans: If classes of high-speed trains passing through Wuhan would still stop at Wuhan Station, then they can rush off between stops; alternatively, a few people head for the surrounding city, then hitch a ride back to Wuhan.

Rui was lucky enough to buy a high-speed train through Wuhan, get off the train, and charter a ride home with several cat friends at the Wuhan Station. Some of the group simply cycled dozens of kilometers back to the city from Huangpi District, Ezhou and other places around Wuhan, for the cats.

Cats are not the only driving force behind this retrograde behaviour. Rae's home town is known for its "hard core" preparedness, and her neighborhood has been plastered with posters. As soon as she got home, Rey put herself in isolation. She hid in the house when the family came. She didn't want anyone to know that she had come back from Wuhan, "My friends were afraid to talk to me when they found out I was back, and some joked about turning me in. "

This "special treatment" Made Rey feel unfair. She would rather go back to Wuhan and stay with the cat, "You are good to people, and people are not always good to you. But if you're nice to your cat, he's really nice to you. You may not want your cat to give you anything in return, but cats can sometimes surprise you. At least it's comforting to come home to them."

Pet shop owner Zhou Mo originally planned to take his dog Akita to Yunnan on January 22, the dog's life span is only more than 10 years, Zhou Mo wanted to let the dog see more scenery. The city had not yet been sealed off, but Zhong Nanshan had made it clear that COVID-19 pneumonia spread from person to person. He was afraid of causing trouble to others, so he cancelled the trip.

"I have a long relationship with both people and pets here, so the store has to go on. "

Bus Stop, private car ban, travel is not only trouble, but also the risk of infection. Zhou Mo every day by motorcycle door-to-door delivery, the farthest round trip each 40 kilometers. In the face of the epidemic, dogs have no food to eat, cats also need not cat litter, for Zhou Mo is still important. "people who don't have pets are less likely to understand our feelings. "

Images on the Internet show that Nehe, Heilongjiang and other places have decided to hunt and kill stray cats and dogs to prevent and control the epidemic.

"discrimination" was a word Zhou repeatedly used, either to express his concern about animals: "Many people are already prejudiced against animals, and this outbreak is also related to wild animals. People who don't know the truth may just listen to the wind. "

Or to say that the attitude of outsiders to the people of Wuhan today is, "I can see the news all day and night that Wuhan people are discriminated against in other places. You can't do that, okay? We actually made a great sacrifice. "

Those who remain in Wuhan can relate to the differential treatment they suffer in the field as a result of being labelled "Wuhan" .

Pet shop owner Zhou Mo originally planned to take his dog Akita to Yunnan on January 22, the dog's life span is only more than 10 years, Zhou Mo wanted to let the dog see more scenery. The city had not yet been sealed off, but Zhong Nanshan had made it clear that COVID-19 pneumonia spread from person to person. He was afraid of causing trouble to others, so he cancelled the trip. "You can't even go out and cough. When you cough, people get scared. "

Zhou Mo family economic conditions are not bad, open a pet shop is not to make big money, but to take care of his more than a dozen cats and dogs. Three years after opening the store, Zhou watched some pets grow up and some guests settle down. The pets became a connection between people and people. "I have a long relationship with both people and pets here, so the store has to go on. "

Bus Stop, private car ban, travel is not only trouble, but also the risk of infection. Zhou Mo every day by motorcycle door-to-door delivery, the farthest round trip each 40 kilometers. In the face of the epidemic, dogs have no food to eat, cats also need not cat litter, for Zhou Mo is still important. "people who don't have pets are less likely to understand our feelings. "

Not everyone understands this sort of value ranking, and in the panic of an epidemic, some vulnerable groups are negligible or even expendable. According to netizens, some pets were taken away and buried deep during the period of isolation, while others were suspected to have been thrown from upstairs. Images on the Internet show that Nehe, Heilongjiang and other places have decided to hunt and kill stray cats and dogs to prevent and control the epidemic.

Mutual Aid

January 25, the first day of the Lunar New Year. Two kittens and a dog died in Zhou Mo's pet shop.

This morning, Wuhan new pneumonia prevention and Control Headquarters issued a notice No. 9, announced 26 from 0:00, except for permitted vehicles, the central area of the motor vehicle ban management. "Road closures" not only stop traffic, but also cut off many lives from the outside world. "Don't say cats and dogs, if there are old people living alone, no one to send food may also starve to death. "

In a race for time, Chou panicked. He and an employee took care of the two stores, which each took four or five hours to deal with day-to-day tasks such as shoveling, feeding and walking the dogs. "Road closure" disrupted the work arrangements, he thought of the second store foster pets less, let the staff to take care of a store, himself rushed out to deliver goods.

I've been out all night. When he came back in the evening, he wanted to stock up on some vegetables, but when he got there, he found that there was only meat left in the supermarket. Zhou Mo ran for a day, too tired to talk, also did not have time to go to the store to see, the result of the three small animals on the line. "It was our responsibility, but we were really forced to do it, and we didn't think it was going to be like this. "

"Road closure" makes rescue of left-behind pets more urgent. Also on the 25th, there were more and more messages asking for help from the wechat backstage of the Wuhan Zoological Association. The person in charge, Du Fan, felt that there could be no hesitation now. "At a critical juncture, we must uphold this responsibility. "

"Why spread the virus everywhere? " "people can't control it, but what about the cat? " Wuhan Small Animal Protection Association is the only Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau for the record, with a "legal status" of civil aid organizations. Their day-to-day rescue of stray animals is often misunderstood. The voices of doubt grew louder in the wake of the outbreak.

Stray dogs on the streets of Wuhan

Saving a cat is a big deal for a member of the association, Xun. On January 31, Du Fan and Schoenberg saved a black cat, Schoenberg elder brother through this experience "the most uncomfortable and most excited mood ever. ".

The cat is indeed difficult to save, after saved the Xun elder brother to have the sense of accomplishment specially. He was trapped on the 15th floor balcony, wedged between the window and the bars, and could fall at any moment from exhaustion. The stray cat couldn't get through the door downstairs, and when word got around that "pets can get new pneumonia, " Schoenberg knew right away: It was a house cat that had been thrown out the door.

In order to save the cat, Du Fan went to the roof, foot on the edge of the fence, upper body out of the fence, throw a rope to catch the cat, stand in the corridor, with a clothes pole supporting the cat to meet.

But a cat can jump into a room if a 15th floor resident is willing to open the window. The owner won't talk, says he's got two kids at home. The cat was rescued, the window was opened, and the owner kept spraying the windowsill with a bottle of disinfectant. "As a mother who wanted to protect her children, she only chose to believe what she thought was right, " he said, trying to understand the owner's behavior, but still feeling aggrieved, "They still have a good family sign on their door. Why do they just refuse to communicate? "

There are many criteria for assessing the value of an animal's life, such as whether it is a threat, domesticated or nomadic, such as breed, lineage, and price. Some dogs are used for racing, some for eating. Even actions driven by love or kindness often rank alongside certain values and become more prominent in outbreaks.

Many people also withhold information in order to give their pets priority for rescue. Du Fan in the mind is not very comfortable, "hope everybody can honestly say, give more pets an equal rescue opportunity" . There is also a disregard for others, "Mingming people in Wuhan, two stops away from the cat house, he was afraid of being infected, said there are old people and children, they do not let us go, I do not know what his heart is thinking. "

Well, it's not just about someone or something. "If we don't save these cats and dogs, they may really die at home and cause a second spread of disease, " said Du, who often uses the excuse to persuade residential properties to let them pass through, which are under strict control, it's often because there's already a confirmed case.

But it can be about caring for one another. When Fan Lina returned home from Wuhan on Jan. 19, she took her cat with her, and after settling her cat, she started worrying about other people's cats and helping wechat groups collect information about rescue efforts. "I want my cat to be good, and I want all cats to be good. "

At 8 pm on the 25th, four hours before the road closure, Fan Lina received a call from a group of friends who said they were in Qingshan District, Wuhan and wanted to get the cat back from the Valley of Light. It was already hard to find a car. Fan Lina remembered a neighbor who had recently volunteered to pick up and drop off medical staff, and contacted him to help. By the time the driver picked up the cat, it was 10:40 p.m. To the community downstairs, the security guard stopped the master at the door. Fan Lina and his friends took turns calling and pleading, and finally got the cat out.

The Standard is established by man and transferred by his will. Zhang Xun, the owner of the pet hospital, found that there were many stray dogs on the streets of Wuhan, and many breeds of dogs were also abandoned. "A lot of people still think of pets as fun and don't value a dog's life. "

Zhang Xun's hospital, which opened last year, is not yet profitable and is estimated to take two years to recoup its investment. The "interim measures for the prevention and control of COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan" issued on January 29 ordered pet shop hospitals to suspend business. Zhang Xun's store is closed to the public, but there will be staff left behind, hoping to meet the animals in need of first aid can also be saved. Some do not need the basic treatment of complex equipment, Zhang Xun drove to the door, "a lot of people call over, can run we must run. "

Before opening the pet shop, Zhang Xun had spent five or six years of his spare time doing rescue work for stray animals. Back then, it was more about going to the market and competing with the dog traders, and if it wasn't there, the dogs would be slaughtered. Arguing, fighting, people throwing knives if they have to. Zhang Xun also knows that their rescue is in the middle of nowhere, but there is no domestic animal protection law.

"when conflicts break out, they have to rely on their own initiative and find their own way to resolve them. "

Overdraft

Money is now one of the few things that can be counted in the long-term predictable fight against disease and unpredictable policy changes.

For pet owners in Wuhan, the original Spring Festival period foster care week, the cost is only about 500 yuan, as the holiday extension, foster care has become a bottomless pit. Looking for someone to feed, the cost of each time mostly also want 100 yuan above, this still does not calculate to pick a lock fee and fare.

Fan Lina had been active in the rescue group for several days, and when one of the girls in the group said that her cat had only five days of food left, she helped contact the locksmith and the cat man.

After the closure, the price of a door-to-door lock in Wuhan rose to 300-800 yuan. After hearing the master's offer, the girl did not reply to Fan Lina's message. A few days later, Fan Lina suddenly found that the girl was still hesitating in the group, saying that the cat had run out of water, but she wanted to wait until she ran out of food before asking someone to open the lock. Fan Lina angrily deleted the girl. "She's not worried. What am I worried about? "

Pet stores are also caught in a never ending cycle of consumption. Two or three people have not returned Zhang's messages, the original foster care has expired, they have not paid off. "If you go home for one week during the New Year, the cost will be 500 or 600 yuan. Now, you don't know how long you will be in foster care. It may be 3000 or 4000 yuan per month. "

There aren't many pet stores that can offer door-to-door service. Zhou estimates that a third of pet stores in Wuhan will not survive the year. His daily expenses, such as rent and wages, cost 7,000 yuan, and his account barely lasted two months. The private tenants of the mall have pulled together a group, looking for a way to get subsidies or rent relief, Zhou Mo know in his heart, not hope.

Something like this has already been answered in Zhou Mo's experience. Now, for example, if you don't have a mask, you have to go out and buy one, but the relevant department also stipulates that you must wear a mask when you go out. And last year, they asked for a dog license, but the big dogs were fined without a license, and then they were refused a license after being fined. Zhou mused, only one sentence with emotion, "if the leadership also like the dog. "

The survival of pets left behind will be more critical, but fewer and fewer people may be able to devote their energies to saving them. Ivan is one of the founders of Wuhan Native Cat, a nongovernmental relief organization. According to Ivan, they have resolved more than 400 requests for help, including through group support, but they are still too weak. Over the past two days, Ivan and others in the group have been told to work from home.

Du Thought that only about 50 families really needed home help. But on the 26th, the day the Wuhan Small Animal Protection Association's article was published, the backstage immediately received more than 300 messages asking for help. Now, the association has helped 400 families, and more than 500 families are still registered and waiting to be solved.

At present, they have two staff members responsible for collating help information, processing background data, and six volunteers, two groups, respectively, home to Hankou, Wuchang, Hanyang, three left-behind animal rescue. Not Enough people, they also set up a mutual help group, let the help themselves in the group docking related resources. "I can't do it, " Du said.

Moreover, under the sense of urgency of "saving lives" , different people have different understandings of how to save and what is "saving lives" .

After the outbreak of the disease, the old cat is one of the most rapid response to the rescue needs of civil rescuers. January 25th, this is an emergency push | cats left in Wuhan, do you have enough food and water? Call us -- or else it will be too late -- as we offer door to door pick up service, it's been read more than 100,000 times in a short time.

A girl saw this article, paid foster care and road fees, let the old cat in their home in Wuhan cats back to foster. Later, she found out that the cat would sell the cat after the rescue. She contacted the cat and hoped that he would send a video or a photo of the cat every day. The cat called angrily, "since you think I might sell your cat for money, let's talk about money. 300 Yuan is not enough for the road, and now Wuhan is closed and it's 500 yuan to go out and do anything. "

The cat later admitted that he was too tired and exhausted to keep his sanity that day. But the trust is broken, the girl asked the cat to return the cat, and the cat busy rescue, ask each other to take the cat away, the two people do not give in, "closure" "road closure" let things further deadlock.

Water and food for the cat from the rescuers

The cat is a controversial figure in the Wuhan Cat Circle, accused of "carrying a breed of cat to save" , "selling cats under the banner of saving cats" , and poor foster care conditions for cats infected with cat plague. But the cat believes that he has adopted a commercial model, through the rescue money to maintain the long-term relief, "let the hungry cat a little less. ". During this period of time, the cat said he had solved nearly 200 information for help, home feeding charges 200 yuan each time, foster 50 yuan a day, at the same time, according to the situation to collect gas and unlock the cost.

He is more efficient, but also overdrawing his personal capacity to save "life" at the cost of greater losses. At least in the sacrifice of a "small part" , which is no longer measured by the gain and loss of simple addition and subtraction.

Zheng Zhen was once a supporter of the cat, but within days his attitude to the cat quickly turned to disgust. Her friend picked up a stray cat years ago and put it in the care of an old cat. This let Zheng Zhen to the old cat impression is very good, in the rescue group almost one-sided scold old old cat, insisted on the old cat speak. Group friends questioned why the old cat did not refute rumors about his "black material" , Zheng Zhen asked, "is it important to clarify or save the cat important? "

Friends back home after the New Year has been self-isolation, depressed, too late to follow up on the situation of the kitten. When contacted again, the friend was told that the cat had died the day after it was delivered, and the cat said that she had been too busy with the rescue to inform her. "If I had known about him earlier, if we had been more vigilant, if we had asked him earlier, maybe the cat would still be alive and well. I will never forget the lesson of losing my life. Again, I am sorry. " Zheng Zhen left a long list of apologies in the help group, out of the group chat.

Aid is a kindness to the weak and small, but that kindness is being tortured more. Though torture may not need to exist.

More pets are being abandoned and more stray animals are in danger, but Zhang has less on hand to help. In the past, most of the active rescuers were blocked by the epidemic at home, Zhang Xun understand, now self-preservation is the first priority, can not engage in moral kidnapping. Like himself, the scope of his ability is no more than a circle around his pet hospital, and the radius is shrinking because of traffic restrictions and strict community control. "It takes time for the environment to change. It takes the whole society to participate. One or two people is not enough. "

That said, Zhang Xun or do not want to let himself idle down, and signed up for the area of the anti-epidemic volunteers, "can do how much do it, even to move a brick. "

Zhang Xun is most worried about the stray animals. The pets that remain are watched, and in more remote corners, more strays remain in silence, unknown.
