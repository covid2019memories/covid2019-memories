On February 3, academician Li Lanjuan, a member of the high-level Expert Group of the National Health Commission, said in an interview with CCTV that Wuhan currently does not have enough detection kits... we hope to send more accurate kits to Wuhan, to get more people tested.

The kit is mainly used for PCR nucleic acid detection, is the focus of hospitals around the use of COVID-19 detection method, the cost is relatively low, detection of about 180 yuan per person.

The NCHC also recommends genetic sequencing: identifying highly homologous individuals with COVID-19 pneumonia can be diagnosed as new pneumonia. Each test costs about $10,000.

In contrast, the cost of nucleic acid kits to become the epidemic area of medical institutions confirmed the case of the "necessary weapon. ".

COVID-19 is an emerging disease, there was no special detection reagent, after learning of the epidemic, many enterprises completed R & D within a short period of time, the Drug Regulatory Authorities Open fast-track approval, to ensure the supply of reagent kits.

Then, it is a series of questions, such as whether the production of nucleic acid kit can keep up, whether the accuracy can be guaranteed, whether the logistics is smooth, and whether the capability of testing organization can match.

In this regard, we consult a large number of professionals, trying to answer the Kit from R & D to laboratory use, the process of facing a variety of problems and solutions.

APPROVAL: the time limit is changed from two years to four days

Since January 26th, seven COVID-19 nucleic acid test kits have been approved by the State Food and Drug Administration.

These products are from geno biology, Zhijiang biology, Da'an Gene, Shengxiang biology, Huada gene, Berger medical and so on.

This means that more test products can be brought into compliance with local hospitals, greatly expanding the use of test reagents. Before this, these test products even if produced, if not listed approval, can only be "scientific research purposes" for the use of the disease control system.

Wuhan had previously distributed kits to 10 institutions to test for nucleic acids, leaving nine hospitals, with the exception of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Yangtze daily said. Since January 28, eight more local institutions to test the agency, including five of the district-level CDC.

On January 22, the State Food and Drug Administration convened a review of 17 companies, seven of which developed COVID-19 reagents that were selected for rapid approval by the State Food and Drug Administration, according to people familiar with the matter.

On the same day, the State Food and Drug Administration said it would prepare for emergency review and approval of medicines and medical devices needed for epidemic prevention and control, according to the requirements of laws, regulations and work requirements

Subsequently, in the regulatory cooperation, the selected enterprises "running all the way. ".

On January 26, the State Food and Drug Administration issued a notice saying that "emergency approval has passed four COVID-19 tests by four companies" and that the approval process took only four days to complete.

Over the next few days, other products from selected companies were approved.

COVID-19's test kits fall into the third category of Medical Devices. According to the usual procedure, after passing the registration test, the local drug administration will complete the system assessment for the sample production process and submit the system assessment report to the State Food and Drug Administration for approval. If approved, the application equipment to obtain the approval of the market.

The head of a Shanghai Reagent Enterprise said that the efficiency of the inspection agency was very high recently: After submitting the data to the Beijing Medical Device Inspection Institute on the first day of the Lunar New Year, the institute worked overtime overnight and finished all batches of tests on the second day of the year in the morning, feedback the qualified report, facilitate the enterprise to carry out follow-up approval process.

In fact, fast-track approvals have greatly reduced the time it takes for these new medical devices to reach the market. Industry sources said the three types of medical devices typically take about two years to market, including a one-year data collection period for clinical trials; in vitro diagnostic reagents must provide at least 1,000 samples.

The above-mentioned reagents enterprise leader also said that after the successful development of medical devices, must first do clinical data collection, to verify the reliability and validity of data before approval for listing. But to control the current outbreak, this fast track compresses the time it takes the disease control system to collect clinical data.

Previously, confirmation of COVID-19 required detection or review by the CDC, so using these unlisted batch kits was not a violation -- as was the practice of the Disease Control Division as part of the clinical trial.

Quality: A rational view of accuracy

Previously, some researchers said, kits are often false-positive and false-negative problems, if the failure rate can not be controlled, may cause test results error. A false positive is a misdiagnosis, and a false negative is a missed diagnosis.

In addition, since in vitro agents used by the CDC do not require State Food and Drug Administration approval, other companies outside the fast-track approval channels of the FDA are "running" into the market through the CDC system.

For example, listed companies such as Xilong Science, Kehua biology, Shuoshi biology, meikang biology and mikes biology have previously said they have successfully developed a nucleic acid detection kit for COVID-19, some of the company's statement to the provincial CDC supply.

With the increasing use of reagent kits, potential detection inaccuracies have attracted much attention.

The widely cited case comes from Tianjin. A female case of infection in Tianjin developed fever on January 21. Three nucleic acid tests were performed on January 27 and 31, all of which were negative. The fourth test on February 1 was positive.

Zhang Xiaochun, deputy director of the imaging department at the Zhongnan Hospital affiliated to Wuhan University, put out an appeal on social media: "Don't believe in nucleic acid testing, " citing patients who already have "hidden diseases. " "One or more negative nucleic acids without any clinical symptoms. "

The technical personnel explained that the current approved kit products mostly use PCR nucleic acid testing, the basic principle is to use technology to expand the detection sample of the virus sequence, so that it can be highlighted to identify the disease. If the patient is newly ill and the viral load in the sample is too low, a false negative (missed diagnosis) may occur.

Because the PCR method is very sensitive, "a little pollution will cause false-negative test, " technicians in the analysis of Tianjin false-negative cases, careless operation may make the test kit results inaccurate.

Test Technology Company "Tiger Jietong" general manager Peng Yifei whoo appeal to the public to view the quality of kits.

He told us that the newly approved kits had been in the laboratory for relatively short periods of time in response to a rapidly advancing epidemic, "but in the face of an emergency public health event, the first thing you need is a test kit. "

"without any tools, the control and management of the epidemic will be greatly affected, including government decision-making. Quality is a secondary problem to be solved, " Peng said.

"We should look at the proportion, not just the individual cases, " Peng said, referring to false positives and false negatives, "false-positive and false-negative tests are also common in other disease kits, such as 5 or 10 out of 10,000 tests. You can't say it's wrong. If you test 1,000 cases and test 500, you can't say it's wrong. "

CAPACITY: 60% 70% restored

Tian Yulong, a party member and chief engineer at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said at a press conference at the Guoxin Office on February 3 that after overcoming "minor difficulties" in terms of time and resumption of production, the average production capacity of each enterprise's reagent box reached 773,000 people per day.

Tian added that production capacity had not been fully restored and had only reached "seventy per cent" of its maximum capacity

This follows the release of their own capacity figures:

BGI says it has regular capacity of 20,000 people a day and can expand to 50,000 if needed. BGI also has a new stockpile of raw materials for 300,000 people.

Pfizer General Manager Li Hui said Feb. 2, in addition to inventory 100,000 spot, the current daily production capacity of 100,000 people. To ensure follow-up production, Pfizer also has 2 million units of raw materials inventory.

The company's Daily output is about 100,000 servings, and it could be expanded to 500,000 servings per day if needed, said Zhou Jun, vice general manager of Shengxiang biology.

The company's Daily output "can reach 200,000 people, " with 200 workers working overtime and "no rest on New Year's eve and bright lights, " CCTV quoted Zhijiang as saying.

"three shifts a day, 100,000 people a day, is the limit, " said the kit developer, who asked not to be named and passed a fast-track State Food and Drug Administration.

Not only that, most enterprises also donated a lot of reagents to key epidemic areas.

BGI, for example, said it had donated 20,000 diagnostic reagents by January 30, with 100,000 to be donated. Sheng Xiang said he donated 10 million yuan worth of reagents and instruments to Wuhan through the Red Cross Society of China. Pfizer and Pfizer have jointly donated $1 million worth of test kits.

Despite the efforts of reagent manufacturers to dramatically increase the number of test strips and reagents available for COVID-19 in the short term, there are still not enough reagents available at the front hospitals.

This differs from Tian Yulong, chief engineer of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, who said that the daily production of kits "is 40 times that of suspected patients, and in terms of total supply, basically meets the requirements. " One reagent manufacturer also received information from a local disease control office that "there are more kits than we can use. ".

One CDC expert said this May reflect Hubei's need to optimize the allocation of kits: The overall supply of kits should be rationalized to the regions or institutions that need them most.

Manufacturers trying to boost reagent capacity also face some tough questions. For example, a reagent manufacturer revealed that the surrounding company for the reagent product itself lack of knowledge, that reagent manufacturers are "producing viruses" , with water and electricity blackouts as a threat to stop production.

Logistics: No problem in Wuhan

The rapid arrival of the kit in the hands of front-line medical staff is not only related to productivity, but also closely related to the logistics situation.

In addition to BGI in Wuhan local production, the majority of approved enterprises are not in Hubei, but in Shanghai, Guangdong and Hunan and other places, must be transported through logistics to Wuhan.

BGI responded that there were no logistical difficulties due to the local production of the kit in Wuhan. Although raw materials are sourced locally, the logistics "Green Channel" facilitates it.

Most businesses are not so lucky. For example, the staff of Pfizer biology also looked for logistics on social media on the 26th, hoping to be able to transport the kit to Wuhan.

Zhou Jun, deputy general manager of Shengxiang Biology, said the Chinese Red Cross helped the company co-ordinate some of the passes to facilitate the shipment of the test reagent to Wuhan.

Some reagent manufacturer's staff said that before finding the logistics business help, even "has the colleague desperately to the reagent human flesh transportation to the front line" .

In addition, some of the products put forward higher requirements for logistics storage conditions, increasing the difficulty of transport. Qiantang River's biological kits, for example, require a storage environment of-20 degrees, which allows only a few logistics companies with cold-chain capabilities to carry them.

Fortunately, the current logistics situation has improved, including the major express enterprises, road logistics transport enterprises, as long as there is a local docking agency in Wuhan, regardless of air or land transport, more goods can enter Wuhan smoothly.

Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China said at a press conference held by the Guoxin Administration on February 3 that, the ministry is "focusing on the establishment of a coordinated transport support mechanism between the ministry and the province to coordinate and solve the problems of emergency transport, especially the transportation support for epidemic prevention and control materials and domestic materials such as livestock and poultry needed by Hubei Province. ".

TESTING: Professional Laboratory to be expanded

Previously, Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, had called for "accurate detection and diagnosis to be equally important while focusing on clinical salvage. " His reasoning was that, timely and accurate testing will help "give a quick clinical diagnosis... relieve panic and unnecessary isolation. ".

Wang said that with improved detection capabilities, clear screening results would gradually become available for patients with suspected and Febrile conditions to be investigated, for high-risk workers, and for the general public who want to know the risk of infection.

This requires Wuhan and Hubei Laboratories to enhance the detection capacity.

Peng Yifei, general manager of Tiger Jetton, said the PCR method is very sensitive and needs to "magnify a very small signal several million times" , therefore, "a little pollution will lead to false positive, so testing laboratory conditions and equipment is very important. "

In addition, the professionalism of the examiners is equally critical.

The detection kit can not be used alone, and a professional is needed to operate the fluorescent quantitative PCR instrument. A DNA sequencing company staff said the kit is suitable for the type of more common, most hospitals can carry out testing, "generally 3 hours can be the result. "

Depending on the size of the instrument, the number of samples that can be processed at the same time "ranges from dozens to hundreds, " one researcher added.

As a result of the inclusion of COVID-19 in the Class A infectious disease management, there are high requirements for the detection and transport of samples of these highly pathogenic microorganisms.

In response to public concerns, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said that the first 10"biosafety laboratories with corresponding protection levels" could be set up to detect pathogenic nucleic acids starting from January 22, "It is expected to run at a rate of nearly 2,000 samples per day. ". In follow-up, the CDC and other third-party testing agencies at the district and county levels were added.

Before that, Wuhan was able to test about 200 samples per day, from January 16, Hubei has a kit to start sampling to return the results about 2 days, about 300 cases of detection capacity. Before January 16, due to "samples need to be sent to the designated testing agency in Beijing, the results will take about 3-5 days to return. ".

On January 30, Mengma Public Welfare Foundation attempted to focus on Hubei Province and collect about 20 PCR laboratories nationwide to provide them with funds and professional support to rapidly improve their detection capability.

The foundation said it expects the donation to be about million yuan.

Wang Shi, executive director of the foundation, said in a press release, "There are only a limited number of testing laboratories that meet the screening requirements and capacity, and the existing laboratories are working at full capacity and can not meet the requirement to screen and confirm all suspected patients in a short period of time. "

The most convenient and effective method at this stage, the charity said, is to "increase investment and modify hardware in laboratories that are already qualified for PCR detection" , to become a medical laboratory that meets national standards and can identify COVID-19 pneumonia.

Pfizer General Manager Li Hui said Feb. 2, in addition to inventory 100,000 spot, the current daily production capacity of 100,000 people. To ensure follow-up production, Pfizer also has 2 million units of raw materials inventory.

The company's Daily output is about 100,000 servings, and it could be expanded to 500,000 servings per day if needed, said Zhou Jun, vice general manager of Shengxiang biology.

The company's Daily output "can reach 200,000 people, " with 200 workers working overtime and "no rest on New Year's eve and bright lights, " CCTV quoted Zhijiang as saying.

"three shifts a day, 100,000 people a day, is the limit, " said the kit developer, who asked not to be named and passed a fast-track State Food and Drug Administration.

Not only that, most enterprises also donated a lot of reagents to key epidemic areas.

BGI, for example, said it had donated 20,000 diagnostic reagents by January 30, with 100,000 to be donated. Sheng Xiang said he donated 10 million yuan worth of reagents and instruments to Wuhan through the Red Cross Society of China. Pfizer and Pfizer have jointly donated $1 million worth of test kits.

Despite the efforts of reagent manufacturers to dramatically increase the number of test strips and reagents available for COVID-19 in the short term, there are still not enough reagents available at the front hospitals.

This differs from Tian Yulong, chief engineer of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, who said that the daily production of kits "is 40 times that of suspected patients, and in terms of total supply, basically meets the requirements. " One reagent manufacturer also received information from a local disease control office that "there are more kits than we can use. ".

One CDC expert said this May reflect Hubei's need to optimize the allocation of kits: The overall supply of kits should be rationalized to the regions or institutions that need them most.

Manufacturers trying to boost reagent capacity also face some tough questions. For example, a reagent manufacturer revealed that the surrounding company for the reagent product itself lack of knowledge, that reagent manufacturers are "producing viruses" , with water and electricity blackouts as a threat to stop production.

Logistics: No problem in Wuhan

The rapid arrival of the kit in the hands of front-line medical staff is not only related to productivity, but also closely related to the logistics situation.

In addition to BGI in Wuhan local production, the majority of approved enterprises are not in Hubei, but in Shanghai, Guangdong and Hunan and other places, must be transported through logistics to Wuhan.

BGI responded that there were no logistical difficulties due to the local production of the kit in Wuhan. Although raw materials are sourced locally, the logistics "Green Channel" facilitates it.

Most businesses are not so lucky. For example, the staff of Pfizer biology also looked for logistics on social media on the 26th, hoping to be able to transport the kit to Wuhan.

Zhou Jun, deputy general manager of Shengxiang Biology, said the Chinese Red Cross helped the company co-ordinate some of the passes to facilitate the shipment of the test reagent to Wuhan.

Some reagent manufacturer's staff said that before finding the logistics business help, even "has the colleague desperately to the reagent human flesh transportation to the front line" .

In addition, some of the products put forward higher requirements for logistics storage conditions, increasing the difficulty of transport. Qiantang River's biological kits, for example, require a storage environment of-20 degrees, which allows only a few logistics companies with cold-chain capabilities to carry them.

Fortunately, the current logistics situation has improved, including the major express enterprises, road logistics transport enterprises, as long as there is a local docking agency in Wuhan, regardless of air or land transport, more goods can enter Wuhan smoothly.

Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China said at a press conference held by the Guoxin Administration on February 3 that, the ministry is "focusing on the establishment of a coordinated transport support mechanism between the ministry and the province to coordinate and solve the problems of emergency transport, especially the transportation support for epidemic prevention and control materials and domestic materials such as livestock and poultry needed by Hubei Province. ".

TESTING: Professional Laboratory to be expanded

Previously, Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, had called for "accurate detection and diagnosis to be equally important while focusing on clinical salvage. " His reasoning was that, timely and accurate testing will help "give a quick clinical diagnosis... relieve panic and unnecessary isolation. ".

Wang said that with improved detection capabilities, clear screening results would gradually become available for patients with suspected and Febrile conditions to be investigated, for high-risk workers, and for the general public who want to know the risk of infection.

This requires Wuhan and Hubei Laboratories to enhance the detection capacity.

Peng Yifei, general manager of Tiger Jetton, said the PCR method is very sensitive and needs to "magnify a very small signal several million times" , therefore, "a little pollution will lead to false positive, so testing laboratory conditions and equipment is very important. "

In addition, the professionalism of the examiners is equally critical.

The detection kit can not be used alone, and a professional is needed to operate the fluorescent quantitative PCR instrument. A DNA sequencing company staff said the kit is suitable for the type of more common, most hospitals can carry out testing, "generally 3 hours can be the result. "

Depending on the size of the instrument, the number of samples that can be processed at the same time "ranges from dozens to hundreds, " one researcher added.

As a result of the inclusion of COVID-19 in the Class A infectious disease management, there are high requirements for the detection and transport of samples of these highly pathogenic microorganisms.

In response to public concerns, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said that the first 10"biosafety laboratories with corresponding protection levels" could be set up to detect pathogenic nucleic acids starting from January 22, "It is expected to run at a rate of nearly 2,000 samples per day. ". In follow-up, the CDC and other third-party testing agencies at the district and county levels were added.

Before that, Wuhan was able to test about 200 samples per day, from January 16, Hubei has a kit to start sampling to return the results about 2 days, about 300 cases of detection capacity. Before January 16, due to "samples need to be sent to the designated testing agency in Beijing, the results will take about 3-5 days to return. ".

On January 30, Mengma Public Welfare Foundation attempted to focus on Hubei Province and collect about 20 PCR laboratories nationwide to provide them with funds and professional support to rapidly improve their detection capability.

The foundation said it expects the donation to be about million yuan.

Wang Shi, executive director of the foundation, said in a press release, "There are only a limited number of testing laboratories that meet the screening requirements and capacity, and the existing laboratories are working at full capacity and can not meet the requirement to screen and confirm all suspected patients in a short period of time. "

The most convenient and effective method at this stage, the charity said, is to "increase investment and modify hardware in laboratories that are already qualified for PCR detection" , to become a medical laboratory that meets national standards and can identify COVID-19 pneumonia.
