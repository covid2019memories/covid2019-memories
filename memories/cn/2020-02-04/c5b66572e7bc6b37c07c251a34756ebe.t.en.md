Riverside drive "empty. ".
The 2,094-meter-long street, with an average daily capacity of 300,000, is one of the busiest shopping streets in Tianjin, with a daily passenger flow of up to 1 million during holidays and peak hours. Every year during the Spring Festival holiday, I always spend a few days here, watching movies, going to shopping malls, and partying with friends.
Today, it is a "Empty Street" , pedestrians can count on one hand, the two sides of the shopping malls are closed, as if half-closed, insist that the business of the mall in the entrance equipped with infrared thermometer, only those who do not have a fever and wear a mask are allowed to enter. Inside, too, it was cold and cheerless, the shop assistants all wore masks, and talked mostly about pneumonia —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— -- Only a row of three guests in the selection of gold jewelry, because "gold can ward off evil. ".

According to a shopping mall staff revealed that this year's average daily turnover during the Spring Festival only 20-30,000 yuan, is one-twentieth of the previous year's same period. The closure notice, issued on the second day of the first lunar month, was the first since 1996 for the old-brand Shopping Mall, which was closed for only half a day during the SARS epidemic in 2003.

The second day of the first lunar month, in Tianjin known as "Guye Day" , in the past year on this day, a car on the road is hard to get, are with children, carrying snacks to the father-in-law family new year's uncle. The second day of this year was shrouded in a thick fog, with few pedestrians on the roads and only a few people on the buses, most of which were empty. Early in the morning, my mother was on the phone with second aunt, trying to figure out whether or not to go to her aunt's house after the outbreak? WHAT IF THE HOTEL WON'T REFUND THE DEPOSIT? Why don't you go ahead and waste it?

It was the fifth day since the first confirmed case was announced in Tianjin on January 21, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 13 and leading to an outbreak. The government launched a level 1 response to a major public health emergency at midnight on January 24. But in my mother's opinion, the epidemic is not serious enough to be unable to go out, relatives know each other well, at home together, but not contact outsiders, go out wearing a mask, who can be infected?

Years ago, they frequented supermarkets and food markets, diligently practicing the tradition of "twenty-five, sweep the soil; twenty-six, Stew the meat; twenty-seven, slaughter the Rooster; twenty-eight, with White Hair; twenty-nine, paste it upside down" , wearing a mask is a huge step forward.

Fortunately, almost no one has actually slaughtered a rooster, the official Weibo account of the Government of the People's Republic of China said on January 23. "Tianjin has released a report that live slaughtered birds sold in three markets have been disposed of harmlessly. ". On the same day, the restaurant association advocates that businesses and consumers negotiate to resolve the issue of refunds.

Liu Jun, who works at a large KTV, bath and restaurant, said they booked 800 tables, 400,000 yuan worth of frozen food and 40,000 to 50,000 yuan worth of vegetables, as well as 200 watermelons during the Spring Festival, filled with four 40-square-meter freezers. On the second day of the New Year, the hotel will be closed down automatically. Customers can return tables or change their dates unconditionally.
The menu was full of a large Iveco, not yet sold out, and Liu Jun estimated the loss, "our boss is sitting in the lobby every day. ". Such restaurants are not a small number, Xibei naked oats village, the country's 400 line stores basically closed, is expected to lose a month of revenue of up to 700-800 million yuan around the Spring Festival, the boss said in an interview, loans can only be paid for three months.

The Eighth Grade Party's canceled. All the parties are canceled. People in Tianjin have a tradition of visiting relatives and friends over the New Year. My family, especially, can schedule visits throughout the holidays. This year, I feel the time at home has become very long and difficult.

Watching TV is the best way to pass the time, and the best way to get local information, i was surprised to find that Tiassa, a news channel that I hadn't watched for years, had 12 episodes and eight shows rolling out the latest news and responses.

The Tianjin subway has been taking temperature measurements on the entire line since January 26. People who do not wear face masks and do not measure their body temperature are not allowed to enter. Riding on the subway is like taking a special train. One car has about 44 seats, and at most there are only 11 or 12 people in it, we each tacitly occupy a corner of a row of seats, carefully keeping others at a distance.

Bus Lines require "a circle one ventilation" , "the average full load rate is less than 70% , to give passengers a safe distance" , a hand grip mask middle-aged woman was ordered to wear a mask to get on the driver.

Taxis and private cars on the platform require daily disinfection, both drivers and passengers wear masks, passengers do not wear masks drivers can refuse to pick up, drivers do not wear masks passengers can complain. But not always strict implementation of Master Xie, he wore a plain cotton mask, pulled over the drunken guests, "do not wear also do not wear, such can have a problem? "
At each end of Riverside drive, a security guard with an infrared thermometer stopped every pedestrian who wanted to cross the street. But with only two thermometers in the whole street, Riverside is not a closed block with only two ends. When I asked what pedestrians would do if they came in through the middle fork, security told me: "Now the temperature is everywhere, if there is really a problem will not be here, can not run the first day of the 15. ".
Wearing a mask and taking your temperature is seen as a mandatory measure of some reassurance, but the increasing number of confirmed cases is also seen as a sign of panic, with everyone agreeing to go out less and have less contact and stocking up. Instant noodles and noodles were the first to be snapped up. In a small supermarket near my home, all of master Kong's instant noodles were snapped up on the second day of the eighth lunar month. In another large supermarket, all bags of instant noodles were sold out, a Wolf on the shelf to borrow, the Tallyman is reloading the barrel face, told those who hesitate to wait for the bag face, "this is the supermarket's last stock, do not know when to re-stock. ".

The situation was not as serious as had been imagined. The chaos of out-of-stock and price increases lasted at most two days. On January 28, the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, 100 tons of Chinese cabbage were sent to the wholesale market; on the second day, vegetable imports increased by 60 percent to 5,500 tons; on the same day, three production lines of the Tingyi factory in Tianjin began operation, guaranteeing a daily output of no less than 4 million bags; from January 31, daily release of some agricultural wholesale market key commodity price monitoring.
With the extended Spring Festival holiday and the postponement of the start of primary and secondary school, most people's lives seem to be at a standstill, except for the occasional trip to buy fresh vegetables and fruits, while others are still working to keep the city going.

On January 26, the Tianjin Municipal Government issued an urgent notice requiring all civil servants in the city to end their holiday early and return to work before 00 on the 27th.
Chen Cong is a street grass-roots civil servant, she received a notice at 12:00 midnight on the 25th, 26 from Henan back to Tianjin, 27 early morning official work. Her work is under the community, door-to-door check whether there are Wuhan, Hubei to Tianjin Personnel, and Publicity Supervision, supervision of the Community Security Post, prohibit entry of outsiders, supervision of the property for comprehensive disinfection, supervision of residents wear masks, wash their hands frequently.
In the city, community prevention and control is the key to prevent the spread of the epidemic. He Qinghua, the first-level inspector of the Disease Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, focused on community prevention and control work at a press conference on January 27, "Epidemic Prevention and control is at a critical stage, we must give full play to the mobilization capacity of grass-roots communities, including rural communities, implement grid-based management of carpet-tracking, and implement protective measures to households, people, people, and the masses to prevent and control the epidemic, and ensure stable prevention and control. ".
Community workers are also under great pressure, working overtime every day, Chen Cong climbed the building and got so swollen that he could hardly speak for several days. The bigger problem is the shortage of protective materials. When Chen Cong went to work, the only protection tool was a mask. There was still a serious shortage of masks. The government failed to coordinate and had to let various units show their magic power. She said she was also afraid, "but it's a job, and there's no way to do it if you're afraid. ".
Also recalled was Zhang Yang, a native of Tianjin who worked in a government affiliated institution. On the first day of the recall, there was no epidemic prevention mission. She did her regular work. At 11:30 p.m. , she was informed that the protective equipment could not be distributed due to insufficient supplies. She did not have to come to work the next day. An hour later, I was informed again that I was ready to go back to work.
The topic of "Tianjin public officials ending vacation ahead of schedule" has been trending on Weibo, with comments ranging from praise to criticism. An article published by Shaq Island, entitled "Early Return of Civil Servants as a precaution? Don't be a formalism" , has now been deleted. Zhang Yang, who had nothing to do with the epidemic, was told again on the afternoon of January 28 to take the rest of the day off until his shift began on February 3.
Masks are hard to come by. On the day of the first confirmed case in Tianjin, my mother bought three packs of generic face masks at three pharmacies at different prices. The next day, the major drug stores mask began to be snapped up, alcohol, 84 disinfectant has been out of stock. Three drugstores near my home posted out of stock notices, one of which was doing out of stock registration, densely filled with several pages of A4 paper, the other simply open next door. During the special period, the staff of the pharmacy was also pushed to the "front line. " When someone came in with a fever to buy medicine, Wang Ling told me, "at this time, the customers are all hiding something. " A few days later, the pharmacy stipulated that patients with cough and fever should register with their real names when buying medicine.

Xu Yi is direct online shopping, e-commerce platform she has placed an order, only received a single, is 21 at 23:08 on the order, from Zaozhuang, Shandong, through Shunfeng Shipping, Jinan, Beijing, arrived in Tianjin on the 30th. She still worries about how long a pack of face masks will last for a family of three, all of whom work at the office.
When everyone wants to grab more masks and give themselves more protection, the scavengers seem to be forgotten. In less than an hour of my stay on Binjiang road, there were not many pedestrians, but at least seven scavengers. As usual, they rummaged through the street for garbage cans and picked out mineral water bottles and waste newspapers. Three of them did not wear masks, and some people have dirty masks.
Almost every person passing by riverside drive will hold up their mobile phone and take a picture of this rare desolation. "I want to record these special times, " said Fan Zhen, a 75-year-old pensioner who has been carrying a DSLR camera and photographing almost every landmark in Tianjin.

Three drugstores near my home posted out of stock notices, one of which was doing out of stock registration, densely filled with several pages of A4 paper, the other simply open next door. During the special period, the staff of the pharmacy was also pushed to the "front line. " When someone came in with a fever to buy medicine, Wang Ling told me, "at this time, the customers are all hiding something. " A few days later, the pharmacy stipulated that patients with cough and fever should register with their real names when buying medicine.

She still worries about how long a pack of face masks will last for a family of three, all of whom work at the office.
When everyone wants to grab more masks and give themselves more protection, the scavengers seem to be forgotten. In less than an hour of my stay on Binjiang road, there were not many pedestrians, but at least seven scavengers.

On January 26, the Tianjin Municipal Government issued an urgent notice requiring all civil servants in the city to end their holiday early and return to work before 00 on the 27th.

Chen Cong is a street grass-roots civil servant, she received a notice at 12:00 midnight on the 25th, 26 from Henan back to Tianjin, 27 early morning official work. Her work is under the community, door-to-door check whether there are Wuhan, Hubei to Tianjin Personnel, and Publicity Supervision, supervision of the Community Security Post, prohibit entry of outsiders, supervision of the property for comprehensive disinfection, supervision of residents wear masks, wash their hands frequently.

In the city, community prevention and control is the key to prevent the spread of the epidemic. He Qinghua, the first-level inspector of the Disease Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, focused on community prevention and control work at a press conference on January 27, "Epidemic Prevention and control is at a critical stage, we must give full play to the mobilization capacity of grass-roots communities, including rural communities, implement grid-based management of carpet-tracking, and implement protective measures to households, people, people, and the masses to prevent and control the epidemic, and ensure stable prevention and control. ".

Community workers are also under great pressure, working overtime every day, Chen Cong climbed the building and got so swollen that he could hardly speak for several days. The bigger problem is the shortage of protective materials. When Chen Cong went to work, the only protection tool was a mask. There was still a serious shortage of masks. The government failed to coordinate and had to let various units show their magic power. She said she was also afraid, "but it's a job, and there's no way to do it if you're afraid. ".

Also recalled was Zhang Yang, a native of Tianjin who worked in a government affiliated institution. On the first day of the recall, there was no epidemic prevention mission. She did her regular work. At 11:30 p.m. , she was informed that the protective equipment could not be distributed due to insufficient supplies. She did not have to come to work the next day. An hour later, I was informed again that I was ready to go back to work.

The topic of "Tianjin public officials ending vacation ahead of schedule" has been trending on Weibo, with comments ranging from praise to criticism. An article published by Shaq Island, entitled "Early Return of Civil Servants as a precaution? Don't be a formalism" , has now been deleted. Zhang Yang, who had nothing to do with the epidemic, was told again on the afternoon of January 28 to take the rest of the day off until his shift began on February 3.

Masks are hard to come by. On the day of the first confirmed case in Tianjin, my mother bought three packs of generic face masks at three pharmacies at different prices. The next day, the major drug stores mask began to be snapped up, alcohol, 84 disinfectant has been out of stock.
