Functional Introduction, light business, understand life.

Yesterday was the first day of rework after the Spring Festival holiday, but because of the new pneumonia, it was destined to be a different starting day. People of the day asked 10 people in 10 different industries, about the work they're doing, that's relevant to our lives, about their lives, about their troubles, about the different aspects of the epidemic.

Who's GonNa take the baby when the parents are stranded in an infected area?

Judith, working mom

I was probably the last to leave our small town in Hubei.

Originally, it was an early annual leave, with a year-and-a-half-old children and in-laws back to Hubei New Year, it was January 19, the epidemic is still relatively stable, human-to-human transmission has not been confirmed. My plan was to spend the New Year in a small town, bring my parents to Beijing, and my in-laws to take me to Florida, in the north of Canton, and I have a lot of people, a two-career family, have to work, with the burden of the child, left to their parents.

But then it was more than I could have imagined. After just three days at home, the bad news began to pile up, and the town was diagnosed. For Fear of children are still small, the town's medical resources are far less than Beijing, I bought the next city overnight plane tickets, the day is not yet dawn, let my parents sent me and the children to the airport.

It was a foggy day, the way to the airport was a blur, the car was driving very slowly, and we were all very quiet, worried about missing our plane. I didn't want to bring my parents with me, but I felt it was not too late for them to come back after the Spring Festival in Hubei. On the way, I received a message from my husband who was still in Beijing: Wuhan is closed to the city.

I felt bad right then and there. Although parents and in-laws in the town from Wuhan is more than 200 km, but there are a large number of migrant workers, the Spring Festival return to the flow is inevitable, followed, I am afraid to be closed.

Sure enough, the next day back to Beijing, still stay there parents received the news of the railway station closure, after that is the highway, provincial road, village road are not connected, and finally is not allowed to drive in and out of the community. In this way, my parents came to Beijing to help me take the baby thing completely put on hold.

My parents and in-laws stayed in Hubei for 13 days, the same 13 days that my husband and I fought with our children. We were exhausted and could not find an appropriate adjective. A year and a half old, demanding, Three Meals a Day, playing and sleeping with her 11 favorite cats, she'd ask me to tell her story about opening a Pie shop about 100 times a day. She had to be coaxed at night, she was full of energy, but because she had to be quarantined for 14 days after returning from the epidemic area, she couldn't go out to play, she had nowhere to vent, and every day she was at home she had to tear down the house and tear it down.

There is also endless work, holidays do not exist, because the existence of the epidemic, but busier than before, I can only while the children sleep, quickly turned on the computer to deal with some things. Time is divided into pieces, all given to work and children, and a life without a sense of self.

It's Day two, so I'm working from home, but I have to be at work on February 10th. My biggest concern is what happens then? If the city's still closed and mom and dad can't make it, do you want a sitter? But I did. How can I trust you in this state? I also saw the news that one person in the two-career family can stay at home to take care of the children, but in practice, I'm afraid it will be very difficult.

People to Middle Age, this is a lot of trouble, and to catch up with such a special period, it is really a pity.

I can't find a place to eat. I've been eating ramen for four days

Dong Sheng delivery boy

My hometown is Sichuan, originally intended to go back to twenty-eight wax month, and then back to Beijing on the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, but the family said home are quarantined a dozen people, I stayed here to work overtime.

Express delivery is now easier than before, one is fewer people on the road, it is easier to go, two is because the community are closed management. We usually parked the car in the door, the guard did not dare to receive express, can only call someone down to pick up. Even if occasionally sent upstairs, the other side usually does not open the door, let me leave the door.

We are now non-contact mode of delivery, with people to maintain two or three meters away, the express box on the ground, but also remind each other to remember to wash their hands. Recently I've had all sorts of strange requests for me to put my deliveries under the tallest tree in the neighborhood, and for me to put them in the grass. There is a family door put a bucket, bucket written on a note: "please drop the courier bucket inside. "

As for ourselves, the site will issue masks every day and will also spray alcohol disinfection. We ran out of alcohol the other day, so we had to buy a 56-proof double-pot in a watering can instead, so if anyone gets a delivery box that smells like white wine, it's probably from us.

The most troublesome thing for us now is that we can't find a place to eat. Big Restaurants can't afford it, and more than 90% of smaller ones are closed. I remember I used to go to a small shop owned by a man from Wuhan, Hubei Province. I used to eat their hot and dry noodles, 15 yuan a bowl, eat very full. Now the store does not open late, estimated that the owner will not come back, I do not know if they are okay. Can Not find a place to eat, can only come back hungry, in the dormitory bubble a bowl of instant noodles, I have eaten instant noodles for 4 days in a row, fast to eat vomit.

The reviews are now many times better

Jack Cheung, delivery boy

At the end of December last year, I just got a new lithium ion battery for my electric car, which can run more than 100 kilometers on a full charge. It didn't take long for the epidemic to hit.

I was delivering food in Zhejiang, and when I saw it that day, it had already been more than 700 cases. To be honest, it's impossible not to feel flustered. We were wearing just a plain mask, and there was no other protective measure. We had to deal with various stores, especially when I heard yesterday that a colleague in Shenzhen had the pneumonia, people exchanged that we should go into a closed restaurant and hold our breath as much as possible, or wait outside the restaurant, even if it's cold.

My daughter-in-law won't let me deliver, but it's impossible not to deliver. Our salary is paid at the end of this month, last month. If you quit this month, even if you withdraw, six thousand yuan salary will be gone. The House we bought in my hometown has a mortgage to pay, and the kids need money to go to school. And as long as absenteeism one day, will fine, a few days ago a buddy fined 400 dollars, two days to work for nothing.

Now people buy things, most of them are fresh supermarket, are necessities of life. I told my wife that if we didn't, people would have to go out and buy them, and if we had small ones, we would have to go out together, said Married... with Children, a psychologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. We're a take-out crew, and we're doing an average of 20 families a day, and if we don't deliver, and everyone runs out, then the risk of cross-contamination is higher, so we're actually doing good.

Delivery's a lot more efficient these days. In the past, the most afraid of things, is to shout a long time customers do not come out, especially to deliver office takeaway. Everyone's home now, and it's on the DOORKNOB. Some colleagues back home, a short period of time will not come back, coupled with the price of our orders these days also rose, before may be 4 dollars a single, now can have up to 8 dollars, the money is really more than before.

I'm just so tired, I have to deliver it every night until 11:00, and the day's work is done. There are warm heart, one night to send two bottles of mineral water, the other side gave me more than ten dollars in change, said it was hard, I was also given a mask, remind me to pay attention to protection, I was very touched.

What surprised me most was that during the outbreak, my ratings went up, to more than 30 reviews a day, many times what they used to be.

The Red and white wedding ceremony is forbidden. The villagers are making a scene

Wang Weiyang grass-roots civil servant

Others work on the Tenth Day of the Lunar New Year, the end of our holiday. In the command center, an office half the size of a basketball court, dozens of people, every day can not take off the mask, a go is to use alcohol and 84 disinfection. Civil servants can't be infected. They can't protect themselves. Who's GonNa believe you.

There are thousands of people back from Wuhan, there are also six confirmed cases. Village cadres use loudspeakers every day to shout, do not go out, do not eat wine, do not play cards. For the more remote families, call them one by one.

The most important thing in the countryside is the red, white and happy events, which is also a difficult point for the cadres to defend. Because of these things, there are fights between villagers and village cadres. Some mourners could not serve alcohol. They were advised to serve separate meals, one plate each. Many of the marriage were postponed, there is a family does not do wine, but must worship a church, the cadres of accommodation, as a result, immediately a neighbor to call the public tip. The report is often, I also received a text message, a fellow said to see a Wuhan license plate car, please check.

The attitude of the grass-roots towards the returnees in Wuhan is that those who come home, those who live in hotels, are well isolated, and those who persuade them to return home. Every day village doctors to focus on the home temperature, for suspected cases, there are specialized doctors home sampling, sent to the city to do the diagnosis.

Every day contact to come and go, grass-roots cadres do not know where to buy masks, some wearing a black mask, some wear anti-haze, as well as cotton yarn, single-layer, strange. One City approved eight N95s, and one official said he wore a disposable mask for three days.

Grass-roots work is most afraid of, what things did not think of, resulting in epidemic control difficult. We have a special inspection team, business premises should be closed, the scenic area has to be closed supervision. But there are always some unexpected, some feet outside the city can not see, but you go inside, still in business, sneaky, later we found a Wuhan woman working here, she came back on the 22nd. There is also a courier, also from Wuhan, also sent to the hotel.

The work is delicate and painstaking, but it is obligatory to do so. Several cadres in neighbouring counties have been suspended for failing to report timely data, while others have been quarantined for receiving suspected cases. Under the epidemic, we are all ordinary people, only one idea, to bring home a safe environment.

And the eggs in Hubei are gone

The owner of Chen Hua's farm

Our company raises more than one million chickens. One chicken eats two taels a day, which is more than 100 tons of feed. After the road closure in Hubei Province, the chicken feed could not enter, not enough to eat, watching the chicken did not lay eggs. The most anxious time, we ran to the feed mill gate block, but the field staff have gone, no one production, also useless.

Fortunately, after I called for help on the public account, there were a lot of messages in the background. A dozen or so media called, reported it, and the next day, the county let in feed ingredients, but in fact, the real problem just started.

Raw materials to be processed, the state-mandated delay in starting. Then we went to Whoo, to do it safely, and finally agreed to go back to work. But we're short-staffed, and no one's coming to work, and no one's at the packing plant, and none of this has been resolved yet.

After the eggs came out, because Hubei epidemic is the most serious, the field do not want Hubei eggs, the driver is not willing to send, sent to the road will be blocked, can not come back, but also isolation. Now a small amount of eggs are still going, the rest of the pressure at home, pressure can only be a half month.

The most difficult part is handling the chicken. It was supposed to be for sale after 60 days. It's the perfect time. If you keep it for 100 days, its food will go up from 2 to 10 taels. If you eat it, you won't grow any meat. The value behind it will become smaller and smaller. And there's no place to keep them now, so the 1,000 they're going to have, the bigger they get, the more they'll probably fit into 500.

The bird flu in Hunan is adding insult to injury to us. My chickens should be sent to the customers. Once the bird flu comes, they can't flow. Raising seedlings requires equipment, heating, before long-term preparation, can not sell, I had to bury. The damage from burying it is minimal. It's a Bummer, right? It's a bummer.

This year, because of the human epidemic, the problem of farming has become even more acute. The effect on chicken farmers is that they may not have them next year, and we are concerned that eggs and chicken will be very expensive.

Less plastic surgery, more counseling

Peng Ruyi, Internet medical cosmetology

Our company has been doing a year and a half, is the direction of the Internet plastic surgery, and the doctor's cooperation, the equivalent of doing plastic surgery agencies.

Plastic surgery is still dominated by young people, especially college students and white-collar workers, so the two peaks of our industry, that is, winter and summer vacation and May Day, holiday. At this time of year in past years, there should be a full schedule of surgeries, New Year's Eve is no exception, now because of the impact of the epidemic, the cooperating doctors have postponed the surgery, to 10 February after, and the time is not yet determined. But at the same time, we've had more people come to us for advice, and I think it's because people can't get out of the house, they have more time to do their homework.

Fortunately, we're a very small startup with only six full time employees and the Internet, so working from home isn't a problem, just a little less efficient. We've been working since yesterday, and until February 10th, we're working online, and we're not asking people to go back to Beijing.

But now the recruitment and financing, the progress is very slow. We've been preparing BP [ business plan ] for years, looking for potential investors to talk to in years, but now it's just online, with both sides suggesting we wait until the epidemic stabilizes.
As for whether the company can really start work on February 10, I am actually worried about it. I think it is a little early. After all, in a super-large city like Beijing, whether the epidemic can be controlled after the return of people is still a very challenging thing.

It could be a long time before people start spending again

Xu Ye catering industry

Half a year ago, I started a new business project in catering. I opened three stores. In Nanchang, I made a Guangzhou-style health-preserving soup restaurant. One shop has an area of 300 square meters. We spent a lot of time managing word of mouth and products. We planned to continue opening new stores after the year to expand the market, but then the outbreak hit, and it hit startups like us hard.

On January 22, twenty-eight on the lunar calendar, our shop closed, the catering industry according to government regulations, must be closed. After all, there is an incubation period, the shop is not able to control these problems. At my three stores, the cost was mostly rent and labor, because we had to pay our salaries as usual, and we were losing $180,000 a month trying to keep the staff stable. Around the Spring Festival is the peak season of the catering industry, if normal business, 3 stores can profit four hundred thousand, so one in and one out, a loss of more than 500,000. We were new to the business, and big chains like Siebe were losing ten million a month.

We have more than 20 employees in a store, 60 or 70 in total, and all of our employees are covered for accommodation. However, we let all of our employees go home on vacation years ago. They did not stay in the dormitory. Originally, they were going to come back to work on the third day of the eighth lunar month. Now everyone is at home to rest, and they are not allowed to go back to the dormitory, otherwise, it's more expensive to run. I have a friend who has an employee who lives in a dorm, and not only does she have to hand out mask sanitizers, put people on duty, but she also has to give them a bonus to keep them in.

We also considered delivery, of course, the benefits would be, for example, to create some brand memory, people have something to do more stable, but the disadvantages are greater, because the staff are all gathered together, in case one person is infected, it is very troublesome, after all, you have to be out in the open to shop or deliver. So as business owners, we have to think carefully about our employees. And if take-out volume is not big, also can not cover manpower cost, can not save a restaurant.

In the past few years, there hasn't been a lot of liquidity and reserve funds in the real sector. Everyone has been suffering. I had hoped for a rebound in 2020 or 2021, but this outbreak has dealt a fatal blow to many real sectors. Everyone is in cash flow business, then we can't run out of cash. And there may be a year-round no money, can only rely on the Spring Festival, but this outbreak in the Spring Festival, the golden stage of our catering industry, many of us are earning a month or two of money, with a settlement with suppliers, then if someone goes out of business, it affects a lot of people.

But I'm still optimistic that this outbreak will bring the restaurant business to a standstill, for all of us, and then we'll all be back to square one. Still got to think positive. And compared to medium-sized catering enterprises, we are relatively small degree of impact, six months can not afford to open a shop. Originally, I took three stores after years, ready to expand the new store, but now also can only put on hold.

If the outbreak is effectively controlled, stores can open in February, but I estimate that there will be half a year, people may slowly and before the same consumption. Before the outbreak, I was thinking about making some quick-selling soups that you could take home with you, but we still have to change our traditional industry, and if we can't run a store, we have to think about other ways of making blood.

Now everyone is crying poor, there are some pessimistic statements, I do not like this, I think this is a reserve power period. Just like an entrepreneur who says he wants the landlord not to charge rent this month, I disagree. The landlord is also doing investment business and taking a lot of risks. This requirement is unreasonable and can not be a moral kidnapping. We should still think of self-help, the enterprise to do well, not to pass the difficulties to a third party.

According to the government regulation, the restaurant business must be closed down. Image / network

We're trapped. We have to survive

Wan Guoying, the owner of Qingyuan Bookstore

Our bookstore opened in 1992 and has been for 28 years now. A few days ago, I titled a Wechat Post, "please don't let me freeze to death in the wind and snow, " and I'm not exaggerating. This outbreak is the biggest crisis our bookstore has faced in 28 years.

On the 30th day of the Lunar New Year, our bookstore closed, usually on the 2nd day of the Lunar New Year, but now the bookstore can not open, online operation is also difficult, staff can not go to work, no one in the warehouse, logistics is either shut down or very expensive.

Qingyuan staff number 51 people, two stores Qingyuan, one 312 square meters, another 806 square meters, and more than 2000 square meters of distribution logistics warehouse, for more than 200 customers in Jiangxi Province distribution books and provide professional services. If it had been open, I would have had four million in cash flow from my 200 plus outlet stores, but that's all gone now.

There is no other source of funding after the bookstore closes, basic rent and staff salaries must be paid, and the existing funds can be maintained for up to two months, as December 2019 is the peak time for payment of suppliers, and January is the peak time for staff salaries and bonuses before the holidays, so there's barely any cash on the books.

So it's been a very difficult month or two for us, not making a profit, spending five hundred thousand a month, the store making very little profit, not having much cash flow, barely making ends meet. The longer the outbreak drags on, the more pressure it puts on us, and it will certainly take some time to recover after it opens on February 10th.

We also experienced SARS in 2003, when the control is not very strict, can open a shop, there are also book friends to buy books, not so much impact. But this time it was serious, and with the exception of the Xinhua Bookstore, many bookstores were fatally hit. Many private bookstores have a single business, relying only on book sales to maintain their daily operations, and the decline in book sales caused by the epidemic is almost precipitous, in addition, most private bookstores have to bear high rent, store rent and labor costs, the ability to resist risk is weak.

Jiangxi does the humanities and Social Sciences Bookstore, we are the best, 28 years we have also accumulated a lot of old customers, a few days ago we introduced the book friends readers to recharge the book card, can slightly alleviate the cash flow problem, but that's just to keep the store open. Moreover, it is impossible to rely on book friends and feelings all the time. We still need to have our own blood-making ability. We increased the construction of the children's section last year, and are also connecting the city's study and public library projects, to make up for the store sales mess.
I'm more concerned about the aftermath of the epidemic, and the fact that a lot of the books, like tutoring, are being sold online, is contributing to this trend. And then the publishing house to collect the funds, sell the goods as soon as possible, it is estimated that through various discounts to recover costs, these are very disadvantageous to us. At the end of last year, the physical bookstore was not in good condition. At the beginning of this year, when the epidemic hit, we were trapped there. There was nothing we could do but survive.

The grass roots are working overtime

An Wang, a civil servant in Zhejiang Province

I've been working since eighth grade. Because I am the deputy director of the unit office, this Spring Festival overtime work must be led by us, we first, and then others, the fourth day of the fourth required all civil servants on duty, start working. We are a little better, originally requested to resume work tomorrow, but late last night issued a notice, requiring all departments and institutions to start rotating duty, there is no recovery time.

Working overtime during the Spring Festival is not busy with other things. We have to make statistics on the situation of returning home and returning to work during the Spring Festival. More than 200 people in our unit started to figure out the arrangements on the first day of the first day of the Lunar New Year, but the situation above has changed quickly. The first day of the first day of the first day of the Lunar New Year was when the arrangements came into contact with Wuhan, then the outbreak spread to Wenzhou and Taizhou.

I basically go to work every day these days, phone contact, fill out forms, summary, sometimes a few hours a day to complete, sometimes until 10 pm, still have to forward documents, draft notice. I was still a little worried when I went to the office, but I always drove to the office, and I was the only one in the office, so I felt a little bit relieved.

Now we've equated the people from Wenzhou with the people from Hubei. Looking at the data from the day before yesterday, Wenzhou is the city with the largest number of newly diagnosed cases of pneumonia in the country except Hubei, surpassing many counties and cities in Hubei.

Many people do business in Wenzhou. After the city was shut down, another 18,000 people from Wuhan returned to Wenzhou. Yueqing is one of the hardest hit areas in Wenzhou. A friend of mine on the street, they had a meeting at midnight, looking for missing contacts, the street basically has no rest since the end of the year, there is no concept of New Year.

Units like ours are doing well, mainly because the functional departments are busy, especially at the grass-roots level. Transportation, health care, and medical staff were notified of the cancellation of their leave on the 30th of the Lunar New Year. The grass roots are overloaded, a street in Tongxiang, Zhejiang Province, missed a patient returning from Wuhan, and three leaders of the street and the community are held accountable.

The day before yesterday, family members in Wenzhou received news that the streets would be searched in a carpet-like manner in the residential area, registering identity card numbers and people's whereabouts. Such searches would last at least five days, and grass-roots civil servants would be under great pressure and have a greater workload, civil Servants Listen to the government's arrangements is also the duty, after the Spring Festival overtime will be given to rest, but the real hard work may be some grass-roots community non-staff personnel.

Do not work time, nest at home can only around the children, or envy no children, have children, very afraid of these turbulence, very hope to quickly control the epidemic, life or calm some good.

The emotions we've accumulated, they're all reflected in the stock market

Non-shareholders

The first a-share trading day after the Spring Festival in 2020 was supposed to be January 31, but due to the outbreak, it was rescheduled. I put it on my calendar in case I forgot the new date, but it turned out to be an unnecessary distraction -- it was the first trading day of the New Year, and everything that happened on February 3rd was unforgettable.

As usual, the stock market began to call for bids at 9 a.m. and waited until 9:30 to open. For the most part, this was the beginning of the unknown, and there was no telling whether it would go up or down, but by this morning, almost everyone knew the answer. Television stock review programs, push the Financial Review, even the bank's wealth managers will use a continuous screen of friends to warn you that today will be a big drop.

Chinese investors may be the most interesting investors in the world, with a unique sense of humor. Before the opening bell, someone said, even the fuse has seen, what else can there be today? As a result, more than 3,000 stocks fell by their daily limit during the bidding round alone. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets fell sharply at the start of the trading day, with more than 3,000 stocks falling together. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 7.72 per cent from the last day of trading before the holiday, its biggest one-day fall since August 2015. This means that whether you are chasing an index or a stock, the options column will probably have to be green losses.

I have always felt that the stock market is a laboratory for revealing human reactions and that it embodies one of the most honest market sentiments. In the ten days between the Spring Festival and the first working day, the fear, anxiety, anxiety and despair that people have accumulated because of the new pneumonia epidemic are reflected in the capital market on this day. The theme today, says the television presenter, is "to digest our fears. " .

But even on the bad days, there is some good news. PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT SPECIALIZE IN LAB supplies and face masks jumped on the day, and the cloud office and online education sectors were also up and running. When there's despair, there's hope. I was reminded of the technical definition of stock market analysis, in the K line chart for trading conditions, when a cross star appears at the bottom of a continuing decline, it means that everything is going to get better and that it is going to bottom out. It is called the star of hope. Today none of us can say when this cross will appear, but at every trough in history it has always appeared.

After the A-SHARE market closed on February 3, data showed that more than 90 per cent of shares fell by the daily limit. Photo / Financial Services Network Wechat public number

Who's GonNa take the baby when the parents are stranded in an infected area?

Judith, working mom

I was probably the last to leave our small town in Hubei.

Originally, it was an early annual leave, with a year-and-a-half-old children and in-laws back to Hubei New Year, it was January 19, the epidemic is still relatively stable, human-to-human transmission has not been confirmed. My plan was to spend the New Year in a small town, bring my parents to Beijing, and my in-laws to take me to Florida, in the north of Canton, and I have a lot of people, a two-career family, have to work, with the burden of the child, left to their parents.

But then it was more than I could have imagined. After just three days at home, the bad news began to pile up, and the town was diagnosed. For Fear of children are still small, the town's medical resources are far less than Beijing, I bought the next city overnight plane tickets, the day is not yet dawn, let my parents sent me and the children to the airport.

It was a foggy day, the way to the airport was a blur, the car was driving very slowly, and we were all very quiet, worried about missing our plane. I didn't want to bring my parents with me, but I felt it was not too late for them to come back after the Spring Festival in Hubei. On the way, I received a message from my husband who was still in Beijing: Wuhan is closed to the city.

I felt bad right then and there. Although parents and in-laws in the town from Wuhan is more than 200 km, but there are a large number of migrant workers, the Spring Festival return to the flow is inevitable, followed, I am afraid to be closed.

Sure enough, the next day back to Beijing, still stay there parents received the news of the railway station closure, after that is the highway, provincial road, village road are not connected, and finally is not allowed to drive in and out of the community. In this way, my parents came to Beijing to help me take the baby thing completely put on hold.

My parents and in-laws stayed in Hubei for 13 days, the same 13 days that my husband and I fought with our children. We were exhausted and could not find an appropriate adjective. A year and a half old, demanding, Three Meals a Day, playing and sleeping with her 11 favorite cats, she'd ask me to tell her story about opening a Pie shop about 100 times a day. She had to be coaxed at night, she was full of energy, but because she had to be quarantined for 14 days after returning from the epidemic area, she couldn't go out to play, she had nowhere to vent, and every day she was at home she had to tear down the house and tear it down.

There is also endless work, holidays do not exist, because the existence of the epidemic, but busier than before, I can only while the children sleep, quickly turned on the computer to deal with some things. Time is divided into pieces, all given to work and children, and a life without a sense of self.

It's Day two, so I'm working from home, but I have to be at work on February 10th. My biggest concern is what happens then? If the city's still closed and mom and dad can't make it, do you want a sitter? But I did. How can I trust you in this state? I also saw the news that one person in the two-career family can stay at home to take care of the children, but in practice, I'm afraid it will be very difficult.

People to Middle Age, this is a lot of trouble, and to catch up with such a special period, it is really a pity.

I can't find a place to eat. I've been eating ramen for four days

Dong Sheng delivery boy

My hometown is Sichuan, originally intended to go back to twenty-eight wax month, and then back to Beijing on the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, but the family said home are quarantined a dozen people, I stayed here to work overtime.

Express delivery is now easier than before, one is fewer people on the road, it is easier to go, two is because the community are closed management. We usually parked the car in the door, the guard did not dare to receive express, can only call someone down to pick up. Even if occasionally sent upstairs, the other side usually does not open the door, let me leave the door.

We are now non-contact mode of delivery, with people to maintain two or three meters away, the express box on the ground, but also remind each other to remember to wash their hands. Recently I've had all sorts of strange requests for me to put my deliveries under the tallest tree in the neighborhood, and for me to put them in the grass. There is a family door put a bucket, bucket written on a note: "please drop the courier bucket inside. "

As for ourselves, the site will issue masks every day and will also spray alcohol disinfection. We ran out of alcohol the other day, so we had to buy a 56-proof double-pot in a watering can instead, so if anyone gets a delivery box that smells like white wine, it's probably from us.

The most troublesome thing for us now is that we can't find a place to eat. Big Restaurants can't afford it, and more than 90% of smaller ones are closed. I remember I used to go to a small shop owned by a man from Wuhan, Hubei Province. I used to eat their hot and dry noodles, 15 yuan a bowl, eat very full. Now the store does not open late, estimated that the owner will not come back, I do not know if they are okay. Can Not find a place to eat, can only come back hungry, in the dormitory bubble a bowl of instant noodles, I have eaten instant noodles for 4 days in a row, fast to eat vomit.

The reviews are now many times better

Jack Cheung, delivery boy

At the end of December last year, I just got a new lithium ion battery for my electric car, which can run more than 100 kilometers on a full charge. It didn't take long for the epidemic to hit.

I was delivering food in Zhejiang, and when I saw it that day, it had already been more than 700 cases. To be honest, it's impossible not to feel flustered. We were wearing just a plain mask, and there was no other protective measure. We had to deal with various stores, especially when I heard yesterday that a colleague in Shenzhen had the pneumonia, people exchanged that we should go into a closed restaurant and hold our breath as much as possible, or wait outside the restaurant, even if it's cold.

My daughter-in-law won't let me deliver, but it's impossible not to deliver. Our salary is paid at the end of this month, last month. If you quit this month, even if you withdraw, six thousand yuan salary will be gone. The House we bought in my hometown has a mortgage to pay, and the kids need money to go to school. And as long as absenteeism one day, will fine, a few days ago a buddy fined 400 dollars, two days to work for nothing.

Now people buy things, most of them are fresh supermarket, are necessities of life. I told my wife that if we didn't, people would have to go out and buy them, and if we had small ones, we would have to go out together, said Married... with Children, a psychologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. We're a take-out crew, and we're doing an average of 20 families a day, and if we don't deliver, and everyone runs out, then the risk of cross-contamination is higher, so we're actually doing good.

Delivery's a lot more efficient these days. In the past, the most afraid of things, is to shout a long time customers do not come out, especially to deliver office takeaway. Everyone's home now, and it's on the DOORKNOB. Some colleagues back home, a short period of time will not come back, coupled with the price of our orders these days also rose, before may be 4 dollars a single, now can have up to 8 dollars, the money is really more than before.

I'm just so tired, I have to deliver it every night until 11:00, and the day's work is done. There are warm heart, one night to send two bottles of mineral water, the other side gave me more than ten dollars in change, said it was hard, I was also given a mask, remind me to pay attention to protection, I was very touched.

What surprised me most was that during the outbreak, my ratings went up, to more than 30 reviews a day, many times what they used to be.

The Red and white wedding ceremony is forbidden. The villagers are making a scene

Wang Weiyang grass-roots civil servant

Others work on the Tenth Day of the Lunar New Year, the end of our holiday. In the command center, an office half the size of a basketball court, dozens of people, every day can not take off the mask, a go is to use alcohol and 84 disinfection. Civil servants can't be infected. They can't protect themselves. Who's GonNa believe you.

There are thousands of people back from Wuhan, there are also six confirmed cases. Village cadres use loudspeakers every day to shout, do not go out, do not eat wine, do not play cards. For the more remote families, call them one by one.

The most important thing in the countryside is the red, white and happy events, which is also a difficult point for the cadres to defend. Because of these things, there are fights between villagers and village cadres. Some mourners could not serve alcohol. They were advised to serve separate meals, one plate each. Many of the marriage were postponed, there is a family does not do wine, but must worship a church, the cadres of accommodation, as a result, immediately a neighbor to call the public tip. The report is often, I also received a text message, a fellow said to see a Wuhan license plate car, please check.

The attitude of the grass-roots towards the returnees in Wuhan is that those who come home, those who live in hotels, are well isolated, and those who persuade them to return home. Every day village doctors to focus on the home temperature, for suspected cases, there are specialized doctors home sampling, sent to the city to do the diagnosis.

Every day contact to come and go, grass-roots cadres do not know where to buy masks, some wearing a black mask, some wear anti-haze, as well as cotton yarn, single-layer, strange. One City approved eight N95s, and one official said he wore a disposable mask for three days.

Grass-roots work is most afraid of, what things did not think of, resulting in epidemic control difficult. We have a special inspection team, business premises should be closed, the scenic area has to be closed supervision. But there are always some unexpected, some feet outside the city can not see, but you go inside, still in business, sneaky, later we found a Wuhan woman working here, she came back on the 22nd. There is also a courier, also from Wuhan, also sent to the hotel.

The work is delicate and painstaking, but it is obligatory to do so. Several cadres in neighbouring counties have been suspended for failing to report timely data, while others have been quarantined for receiving suspected cases. Under the epidemic, we are all ordinary people, only one idea, to bring home a safe environment.

And the eggs in Hubei are gone

The owner of Chen Hua's farm

Our company raises more than one million chickens. One chicken eats two taels a day, which is more than 100 tons of feed. After the road closure in Hubei Province, the chicken feed could not enter, not enough to eat, watching the chicken did not lay eggs. The most anxious time, we ran to the feed mill gate block, but the field staff have gone, no one production, also useless.

Fortunately, after I called for help on the public account, there were a lot of messages in the background. A dozen or so media called, reported it, and the next day, the county let in feed ingredients, but in fact, the real problem just started.

Raw materials to be processed, the state-mandated delay in starting. Then we went to Whoo, to do it safely, and finally agreed to go back to work. But we're short-staffed, and no one's coming to work, and no one's at the packing plant, and none of this has been resolved yet.

After the eggs came out, because Hubei epidemic is the most serious, the field do not want Hubei eggs, the driver is not willing to send, sent to the road will be blocked, can not come back, but also isolation. Now a small amount of eggs are still going, the rest of the pressure at home, pressure can only be a half month.

The most difficult part is handling the chicken. It was supposed to be for sale after 60 days. It's the perfect time. If you keep it for 100 days, its food will go up from 2 to 10 taels. If you eat it, you won't grow any meat. The value behind it will become smaller and smaller. And there's no place to keep them now, so the 1,000 they're going to have, the bigger they get, the more they'll probably fit into 500.

The bird flu in Hunan is adding insult to injury to us. My chickens should be sent to the customers. Once the bird flu comes, they can't flow. Raising seedlings requires equipment, heating, before long-term preparation, can not sell, I had to bury. The damage from burying it is minimal. It's a Bummer, right? It's a bummer.

This year, because of the human epidemic, the problem of farming has become even more acute. The effect on chicken farmers is that they may not have them next year, and we are concerned that eggs and chicken will be very expensive.

Less plastic surgery, more counseling

Peng Ruyi, Internet medical cosmetology

Our company has been doing a year and a half, is the direction of the Internet plastic surgery, and the doctor's cooperation, the equivalent of doing plastic surgery agencies.

Plastic surgery is still dominated by young people, especially college students and white-collar workers, so the two peaks of our industry, that is, winter and summer vacation and May Day, holiday. At this time of year in past years, there should be a full schedule of surgeries, New Year's Eve is no exception, now because of the impact of the epidemic, the cooperating doctors have postponed the surgery, to 10 February after, and the time is not yet determined. But at the same time, we've had more people come to us for advice, and I think it's because people can't get out of the house, they have more time to do their homework.

Fortunately, we're a very small startup with only six full time employees and the Internet, so working from home isn't a problem, just a little less efficient. We've been working since yesterday, and until February 10th, we're working online, and we're not asking people to go back to Beijing.

But now the recruitment and financing, the progress is very slow. We've been preparing BP [ business plan ] for years, looking for potential investors to talk to in years, but now it's just online, with both sides suggesting we wait until the epidemic stabilizes.
As for whether the company can really start work on February 10, I am actually worried about it. I think it is a little early. After all, in a super-large city like Beijing, whether the epidemic can be controlled after the return of people is still a very challenging thing.

It could be a long time before people start spending again

Xu Ye catering industry

Half a year ago, I started a new business project in catering. I opened three stores. In Nanchang, I made a Guangzhou-style health-preserving soup restaurant. One shop has an area of 300 square meters. We spent a lot of time managing word of mouth and products. We planned to continue opening new stores after the year to expand the market, but then the outbreak hit, and it hit startups like us hard.

On January 22, twenty-eight on the lunar calendar, our shop closed, the catering industry according to government regulations, must be closed. After all, there is an incubation period, the shop is not able to control these problems. At my three stores, the cost was mostly rent and labor, because we had to pay our salaries as usual, and we were losing $180,000 a month trying to keep the staff stable. Around the Spring Festival is the peak season of the catering industry, if normal business, 3 stores can profit four hundred thousand, so one in and one out, a loss of more than 500,000. We were new to the business, and big chains like Siebe were losing ten million a month.

We have more than 20 employees in a store, 60 or 70 in total, and all of our employees are covered for accommodation. However, we let all of our employees go home on vacation years ago. They did not stay in the dormitory. Originally, they were going to come back to work on the third day of the eighth lunar month. Now everyone is at home to rest, and they are not allowed to go back to the dormitory, otherwise, it's more expensive to run. I have a friend who has an employee who lives in a dorm, and not only does she have to hand out mask sanitizers, put people on duty, but she also has to give them a bonus to keep them in.

We also considered delivery, of course, the benefits would be, for example, to create some brand memory, people have something to do more stable, but the disadvantages are greater, because the staff are all gathered together, in case one person is infected, it is very troublesome, after all, you have to be out in the open to shop or deliver. So as business owners, we have to think carefully about our employees. And if take-out volume is not big, also can not cover manpower cost, can not save a restaurant.

In the past few years, there hasn't been a lot of liquidity and reserve funds in the real sector. Everyone has been suffering. I had hoped for a rebound in 2020 or 2021, but this outbreak has dealt a fatal blow to many real sectors. Everyone is in cash flow business, then we can't run out of cash. And there may be a year-round no money, can only rely on the Spring Festival, but this outbreak in the Spring Festival, the golden stage of our catering industry, many of us are earning a month or two of money, with a settlement with suppliers, then if someone goes out of business, it affects a lot of people.

But I'm still optimistic that this outbreak will bring the restaurant business to a standstill, for all of us, and then we'll all be back to square one. Still got to think positive. And compared to medium-sized catering enterprises, we are relatively small degree of impact, six months can not afford to open a shop. Originally, I took three stores after years, ready to expand the new store, but now also can only put on hold.

If the outbreak is effectively controlled, stores can open in February, but I estimate that there will be half a year, people may slowly and before the same consumption. Before the outbreak, I was thinking about making some quick-selling soups that you could take home with you, but we still have to change our traditional industry, and if we can't run a store, we have to think about other ways of making blood.

Now everyone is crying poor, there are some pessimistic statements, I do not like this, I think this is a reserve power period. Just like an entrepreneur who says he wants the landlord not to charge rent this month, I disagree. The landlord is also doing investment business and taking a lot of risks. This requirement is unreasonable and can not be a moral kidnapping. We should still think of self-help, the enterprise to do well, not to pass the difficulties to a third party.

According to the government regulation, the restaurant business must be closed down. Image / network

We're trapped. We have to survive

Wan Guoying, the owner of Qingyuan Bookstore

Our bookstore opened in 1992 and has been for 28 years now. A few days ago, I titled a Wechat Post, "please don't let me freeze to death in the wind and snow, " and I'm not exaggerating. This outbreak is the biggest crisis our bookstore has faced in 28 years.

On the 30th day of the Lunar New Year, our bookstore closed, usually on the 2nd day of the Lunar New Year, but now the bookstore can not open, online operation is also difficult, staff can not go to work, no one in the warehouse, logistics is either shut down or very expensive.

Qingyuan staff number 51 people, two stores Qingyuan, one 312 square meters, another 806 square meters, and more than 2000 square meters of distribution logistics warehouse, for more than 200 customers in Jiangxi Province distribution books and provide professional services. If it had been open, I would have had four million in cash flow from my 200 plus outlet stores, but that's all gone now.

There is no other source of funding after the bookstore closes, basic rent and staff salaries must be paid, and the existing funds can be maintained for up to two months, as December 2019 is the peak time for payment of suppliers, and January is the peak time for staff salaries and bonuses before the holidays, so there's barely any cash on the books.

So it's been a very difficult month or two for us, not making a profit, spending five hundred thousand a month, the store making very little profit, not having much cash flow, barely making ends meet. The longer the outbreak drags on, the more pressure it puts on us, and it will certainly take some time to recover after it opens on February 10th.

We also experienced SARS in 2003, when the control is not very strict, can open a shop, there are also book friends to buy books, not so much impact. But this time it was serious, and with the exception of the Xinhua Bookstore, many bookstores were fatally hit. Many private bookstores have a single business, relying only on book sales to maintain their daily operations, and the decline in book sales caused by the epidemic is almost precipitous, in addition, most private bookstores have to bear high rent, store rent and labor costs, the ability to resist risk is weak.

Jiangxi does the humanities and Social Sciences Bookstore, we are the best, 28 years we have also accumulated a lot of old customers, a few days ago we introduced the book friends readers to recharge the book card, can slightly alleviate the cash flow problem, but that's just to keep the store open. Moreover, it is impossible to rely on book friends and feelings all the time. We still need to have our own blood-making ability. We increased the construction of the children's section last year, and are also connecting the city's study and public library projects, to make up for the store sales mess.
I'm more concerned about the aftermath of the epidemic, and the fact that a lot of the books, like tutoring, are being sold online, is contributing to this trend. And then the publishing house to collect the funds, sell the goods as soon as possible, it is estimated that through various discounts to recover costs, these are very disadvantageous to us. At the end of last year, the physical bookstore was not in good condition. At the beginning of this year, when the epidemic hit, we were trapped there. There was nothing we could do but survive.

The grass roots are working overtime

An Wang, a civil servant in Zhejiang Province

I've been working since eighth grade. Because I am the deputy director of the unit office, this Spring Festival overtime work must be led by us, we first, and then others, the fourth day of the fourth required all civil servants on duty, start working. We are a little better, originally requested to resume work tomorrow, but late last night issued a notice, requiring all departments and institutions to start rotating duty, there is no recovery time.

Working overtime during the Spring Festival is not busy with other things. We have to make statistics on the situation of returning home and returning to work during the Spring Festival. More than 200 people in our unit started to figure out the arrangements on the first day of the first day of the Lunar New Year, but the situation above has changed quickly. The first day of the first day of the first day of the Lunar New Year was when the arrangements came into contact with Wuhan, then the outbreak spread to Wenzhou and Taizhou.

I basically go to work every day these days, phone contact, fill out forms, summary, sometimes a few hours a day to complete, sometimes until 10 pm, still have to forward documents, draft notice. I was still a little worried when I went to the office, but I always drove to the office, and I was the only one in the office, so I felt a little bit relieved.

Now we've equated the people from Wenzhou with the people from Hubei. Looking at the data from the day before yesterday, Wenzhou is the city with the largest number of newly diagnosed cases of pneumonia in the country except Hubei, surpassing many counties and cities in Hubei.

Many people do business in Wenzhou. After the city was shut down, another 18,000 people from Wuhan returned to Wenzhou. Yueqing is one of the hardest hit areas in Wenzhou. A friend of mine on the street, they had a meeting at midnight, looking for missing contacts, the street basically has no rest since the end of the year, there is no concept of New Year.

Units like ours are doing well, mainly because the functional departments are busy, especially at the grass-roots level. Transportation, health care, and medical staff were notified of the cancellation of their leave on the 30th of the Lunar New Year. The grass roots are overloaded, a street in Tongxiang, Zhejiang Province, missed a patient returning from Wuhan, and three leaders of the street and the community are held accountable.

The day before yesterday, family members in Wenzhou received news that the streets would be searched in a carpet-like manner in the residential area, registering identity card numbers and people's whereabouts. Such searches would last at least five days, and grass-roots civil servants would be under great pressure and have a greater workload, civil Servants Listen to the government's arrangements is also the duty, after the Spring Festival overtime will be given to rest, but the real hard work may be some grass-roots community non-staff personnel.

Do not work time, nest at home can only around the children, or envy no children, have children, very afraid of these turbulence, very hope to quickly control the epidemic, life or calm some good.

The emotions we've accumulated, they're all reflected in the stock market

Non-shareholders

The first a-share trading day after the Spring Festival in 2020 was supposed to be January 31, but due to the outbreak, it was rescheduled. I put it on my calendar in case I forgot the new date, but it turned out to be an unnecessary distraction -- it was the first trading day of the New Year, and everything that happened on February 3rd was unforgettable.

As usual, the stock market began to call for bids at 9 a.m. and waited until 9:30 to open. For the most part, this was the beginning of the unknown, and there was no telling whether it would go up or down, but by this morning, almost everyone knew the answer. Television stock review programs, push the Financial Review, even the bank's wealth managers will use a continuous screen of friends to warn you that today will be a big drop.

Chinese investors may be the most interesting investors in the world, with a unique sense of humor. Before the opening bell, someone said, even the fuse has seen, what else can there be today? As a result, more than 3,000 stocks fell by their daily limit during the bidding round alone. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets fell sharply at the start of the trading day, with more than 3,000 stocks falling together. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 7.72 per cent from the last day of trading before the holiday, its biggest one-day fall since August 2015. This means that whether you are chasing an index or a stock, the options column will probably have to be green losses.

I have always felt that the stock market is a laboratory for revealing human reactions and that it embodies one of the most honest market sentiments. In the ten days between the Spring Festival and the first working day, the fear, anxiety, anxiety and despair that people have accumulated because of the new pneumonia epidemic are reflected in the capital market on this day. The theme today, says the television presenter, is "to digest our fears. " .

But even on the bad days, there is some good news. PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT SPECIALIZE IN LAB supplies and face masks jumped on the day, and the cloud office and online education sectors were also up and running. When there's despair, there's hope. I was reminded of the technical definition of stock market analysis, in the K line chart for trading conditions, when a cross star appears at the bottom of a continuing decline, it means that everything is going to get better and that it is going to bottom out. It is called the star of hope. Today none of us can say when this cross will appear, but at every trough in history it has always appeared.

After the A-SHARE market closed on February 3, data showed that more than 90 per cent of shares fell by the daily limit. Photo / Financial Services Network Wechat public number

Who's GonNa take the baby when the parents are stranded in an infected area?

Judith, working mom

I was probably the last to leave our small town in Hubei.

Originally, it was an early annual leave, with a year-and-a-half-old children and in-laws back to Hubei New Year, it was January 19, the epidemic is still relatively stable, human-to-human transmission has not been confirmed. My plan was to spend the New Year in a small town, bring my parents to Beijing, and my in-laws to take me to Florida, in the north of Canton, and I have a lot of people, a two-career family, have to work, with the burden of the child, left to their parents.

But then it was more than I could have imagined. After just three days at home, the bad news began to pile up, and the town was diagnosed. For Fear of children are still small, the town's medical resources are far less than Beijing, I bought the next city overnight plane tickets, the day is not yet dawn, let my parents sent me and the children to the airport.

It was a foggy day, the way to the airport was a blur, the car was driving very slowly, and we were all very quiet, worried about missing our plane. I didn't want to bring my parents with me, but I felt it was not too late for them to come back after the Spring Festival in Hubei. On the way, I received a message from my husband who was still in Beijing: Wuhan is closed to the city.

I felt bad right then and there. Although parents and in-laws in the town from Wuhan is more than 200 km, but there are a large number of migrant workers, the Spring Festival return to the flow is inevitable, followed, I am afraid to be closed.

Sure enough, the next day back to Beijing, still stay there parents received the news of the railway station closure, after that is the highway, provincial road, village road are not connected, and finally is not allowed to drive in and out of the community. In this way, my parents came to Beijing to help me take the baby thing completely put on hold.

My parents and in-laws stayed in Hubei for 13 days, the same 13 days that my husband and I fought with our children. We were exhausted and could not find an appropriate adjective. A year and a half old, demanding, Three Meals a Day, playing and sleeping with her 11 favorite cats, she'd ask me to tell her story about opening a Pie shop about 100 times a day. She had to be coaxed at night, she was full of energy, but because she had to be quarantined for 14 days after returning from the epidemic area, she couldn't go out to play, she had nowhere to vent, and every day she was at home she had to tear down the house and tear it down.

There is also endless work, holidays do not exist, because the existence of the epidemic, but busier than before, I can only while the children sleep, quickly turned on the computer to deal with some things. Time is divided into pieces, all given to work and children, and a life without a sense of self.

It's Day two, so I'm working from home, but I have to be at work on February 10th. My biggest concern is what happens then? If the city's still closed and mom and dad can't make it, do you want a sitter? But I did. How can I trust you in this state? I also saw the news that one person in the two-career family can stay at home to take care of the children, but in practice, I'm afraid it will be very difficult.

People to Middle Age, this is a lot of trouble, and to catch up with such a special period, it is really a pity.

I can't find a place to eat. I've been eating ramen for four days

Dong Sheng delivery boy

My hometown is Sichuan, originally intended to go back to twenty-eight wax month, and then back to Beijing on the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, but the family said home are quarantined a dozen people, I stayed here to work overtime.

Express delivery is now easier than before, one is fewer people on the road, it is easier to go, two is because the community are closed management. We usually parked the car in the door, the guard did not dare to receive express, can only call someone down to pick up. Even if occasionally sent upstairs, the other side usually does not open the door, let me leave the door.

We are now non-contact mode of delivery, with people to maintain two or three meters away, the express box on the ground, but also remind each other to remember to wash their hands. Recently I've had all sorts of strange requests for me to put my deliveries under the tallest tree in the neighborhood, and for me to put them in the grass. There is a family door put a bucket, bucket written on a note: "please drop the courier bucket inside. "

As for ourselves, the site will issue masks every day and will also spray alcohol disinfection. We ran out of alcohol the other day, so we had to buy a 56-proof double-pot in a watering can instead, so if anyone gets a delivery box that smells like white wine, it's probably from us.

The most troublesome thing for us now is that we can't find a place to eat. Big Restaurants can't afford it, and more than 90% of smaller ones are closed. I remember I used to go to a small shop owned by a man from Wuhan, Hubei Province. I used to eat their hot and dry noodles, 15 yuan a bowl, eat very full. Now the store does not open late, estimated that the owner will not come back, I do not know if they are okay. Can Not find a place to eat, can only come back hungry, in the dormitory bubble a bowl of instant noodles, I have eaten instant noodles for 4 days in a row, fast to eat vomit.

The reviews are now many times better

Jack Cheung, delivery boy

At the end of December last year, I just got a new lithium ion battery for my electric car, which can run more than 100 kilometers on a full charge. It didn't take long for the epidemic to hit.

I was delivering food in Zhejiang, and when I saw it that day, it had already been more than 700 cases. To be honest, it's impossible not to feel flustered. We were wearing just a plain mask, and there was no other protective measure. We had to deal with various stores, especially when I heard yesterday that a colleague in Shenzhen had the pneumonia, people exchanged that we should go into a closed restaurant and hold our breath as much as possible, or wait outside the restaurant, even if it's cold.

My daughter-in-law won't let me deliver, but it's impossible not to deliver. Our salary is paid at the end of this month, last month. If you quit this month, even if you withdraw, six thousand yuan salary will be gone. The House we bought in my hometown has a mortgage to pay, and the kids need money to go to school. And as long as absenteeism one day, will fine, a few days ago a buddy fined 400 dollars, two days to work for nothing.

Now people buy things, most of them are fresh supermarket, are necessities of life. I told my wife that if we didn't, people would have to go out and buy them, and if we had small ones, we would have to go out together, said Married... with Children, a psychologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. We're a take-out crew, and we're doing an average of 20 families a day, and if we don't deliver, and everyone runs out, then the risk of cross-contamination is higher, so we're actually doing good.

Delivery's a lot more efficient these days. In the past, the most afraid of things, is to shout a long time customers do not come out, especially to deliver office takeaway. Everyone's home now, and it's on the DOORKNOB. Some colleagues back home, a short period of time will not come back, coupled with the price of our orders these days also rose, before may be 4 dollars a single, now can have up to 8 dollars, the money is really more than before.

I'm just so tired, I have to deliver it every night until 11:00, and the day's work is done. There are warm heart, one night to send two bottles of mineral water, the other side gave me more than ten dollars in change, said it was hard, I was also given a mask, remind me to pay attention to protection, I was very touched.

What surprised me most was that during the outbreak, my ratings went up, to more than 30 reviews a day, many times what they used to be.

The Red and white wedding ceremony is forbidden. The villagers are making a scene

Wang Weiyang grass-roots civil servant

Others work on the Tenth Day of the Lunar New Year, the end of our holiday. In the command center, an office half the size of a basketball court, dozens of people, every day can not take off the mask, a go is to use alcohol and 84 disinfection. Civil servants can't be infected. They can't protect themselves. Who's GonNa believe you.

There are thousands of people back from Wuhan, there are also six confirmed cases. Village cadres use loudspeakers every day to shout, do not go out, do not eat wine, do not play cards. For the more remote families, call them one by one.

The most important thing in the countryside is the red, white and happy events, which is also a difficult point for the cadres to defend. Because of these things, there are fights between villagers and village cadres. Some mourners could not serve alcohol. They were advised to serve separate meals, one plate each. Many of the marriage were postponed, there is a family does not do wine, but must worship a church, the cadres of accommodation, as a result, immediately a neighbor to call the public tip. The report is often, I also received a text message, a fellow said to see a Wuhan license plate car, please check.

The attitude of the grass-roots towards the returnees in Wuhan is that those who come home, those who live in hotels, are well isolated, and those who persuade them to return home. Every day village doctors to focus on the home temperature, for suspected cases, there are specialized doctors home sampling, sent to the city to do the diagnosis.

Every day contact to come and go, grass-roots cadres do not know where to buy masks, some wearing a black mask, some wear anti-haze, as well as cotton yarn, single-layer, strange. One City approved eight N95s, and one official said he wore a disposable mask for three days.

Grass-roots work is most afraid of, what things did not think of, resulting in epidemic control difficult. We have a special inspection team, business premises should be closed, the scenic area has to be closed supervision. But there are always some unexpected, some feet outside the city can not see, but you go inside, still in business, sneaky, later we found a Wuhan woman working here, she came back on the 22nd. There is also a courier, also from Wuhan, also sent to the hotel.

The work is delicate and painstaking, but it is obligatory to do so. Several cadres in neighbouring counties have been suspended for failing to report timely data, while others have been quarantined for receiving suspected cases. Under the epidemic, we are all ordinary people, only one idea, to bring home a safe environment.

And the eggs in Hubei are gone

The owner of Chen Hua's farm

Our company raises more than one million chickens. One chicken eats two taels a day, which is more than 100 tons of feed. After the road closure in Hubei Province, the chicken feed could not enter, not enough to eat, watching the chicken did not lay eggs. The most anxious time, we ran to the feed mill gate block, but the field staff have gone, no one production, also useless.

Fortunately, after I called for help on the public account, there were a lot of messages in the background. A dozen or so media called, reported it, and the next day, the county let in feed ingredients, but in fact, the real problem just started.

Raw materials to be processed, the state-mandated delay in starting. Then we went to Whoo, to do it safely, and finally agreed to go back to work. But we're short-staffed, and no one's coming to work, and no one's at the packing plant, and none of this has been resolved yet.

After the eggs came out, because Hubei epidemic is the most serious, the field do not want Hubei eggs, the driver is not willing to send, sent to the road will be blocked, can not come back, but also isolation. Now a small amount of eggs are still going, the rest of the pressure at home, pressure can only be a half month.

The most difficult part is handling the chicken. It was supposed to be for sale after 60 days. It's the perfect time. If you keep it for 100 days, its food will go up from 2 to 10 taels. If you eat it, you won't grow any meat. The value behind it will become smaller and smaller. And there's no place to keep them now, so the 1,000 they're going to have, the bigger they get, the more they'll probably fit into 500.

The bird flu in Hunan is adding insult to injury to us. My chickens should be sent to the customers. Once the bird flu comes, they can't flow. Raising seedlings requires equipment, heating, before long-term preparation, can not sell, I had to bury. The damage from burying it is minimal. It's a Bummer, right? It's a bummer.

This year, because of the human epidemic, the problem of farming has become even more acute. The effect on chicken farmers is that they may not have them next year, and we are concerned that eggs and chicken will be very expensive.

Less plastic surgery, more counseling

Peng Ruyi, Internet medical cosmetology

Our company has been doing a year and a half, is the direction of the Internet plastic surgery, and the doctor's cooperation, the equivalent of doing plastic surgery agencies.

Plastic surgery is still dominated by young people, especially college students and white-collar workers, so the two peaks of our industry, that is, winter and summer vacation and May Day, holiday. At this time of year in past years, there should be a full schedule of surgeries, New Year's Eve is no exception, now because of the impact of the epidemic, the cooperating doctors have postponed the surgery, to 10 February after, and the time is not yet determined. But at the same time, we've had more people come to us for advice, and I think it's because people can't get out of the house, they have more time to do their homework.

Fortunately, we're a very small startup with only six full time employees and the Internet, so working from home isn't a problem, just a little less efficient. We've been working since yesterday, and until February 10th, we're working online, and we're not asking people to go back to Beijing.

But now the recruitment and financing, the progress is very slow. We've been preparing BP [ business plan ] for years, looking for potential investors to talk to in years, but now it's just online, with both sides suggesting we wait until the epidemic stabilizes.

As for whether the company can really start work on February 10, I am actually worried about it. I think it is a little early. After all, in a super-large city like Beijing, whether the epidemic can be controlled after the return of people is still a very challenging thing.

It could be a long time before people start spending again

Xu Ye catering industry

Half a year ago, I started a new business project in catering. I opened three stores. In Nanchang, I made a Guangzhou-style health-preserving soup restaurant. One shop has an area of 300 square meters. We spent a lot of time managing word of mouth and products. We planned to continue opening new stores after the year to expand the market, but then the outbreak hit, and it hit startups like us hard.

On January 22, twenty-eight on the lunar calendar, our shop closed, the catering industry according to government regulations, must be closed. After all, there is an incubation period, the shop is not able to control these problems. At my three stores, the cost was mostly rent and labor, because we had to pay our salaries as usual, and we were losing $180,000 a month trying to keep the staff stable. Around the Spring Festival is the peak season of the catering industry, if normal business, 3 stores can profit four hundred thousand, so one in and one out, a loss of more than 500,000. We were new to the business, and big chains like Siebe were losing ten million a month.

We have more than 20 employees in a store, 60 or 70 in total, and all of our employees are covered for accommodation. However, we let all of our employees go home on vacation years ago. They did not stay in the dormitory. Originally, they were going to come back to work on the third day of the eighth lunar month. Now everyone is at home to rest, and they are not allowed to go back to the dormitory, otherwise, it's more expensive to run. I have a friend who has an employee who lives in a dorm, and not only does she have to hand out mask sanitizers, put people on duty, but she also has to give them a bonus to keep them in.

We also considered delivery, of course, the benefits would be, for example, to create some brand memory, people have something to do more stable, but the disadvantages are greater, because the staff are all gathered together, in case one person is infected, it is very troublesome, after all, you have to be out in the open to shop or deliver. So as business owners, we have to think carefully about our employees. And if take-out volume is not big, also can not cover manpower cost, can not save a restaurant.

In the past few years, there hasn't been a lot of liquidity and reserve funds in the real sector. Everyone has been suffering. I had hoped for a rebound in 2020 or 2021, but this outbreak has dealt a fatal blow to many real sectors. Everyone is in cash flow business, then we can't run out of cash. And there may be a year-round no money, can only rely on the Spring Festival, but this outbreak in the Spring Festival, the golden stage of our catering industry, many of us are earning a month or two of money, with a settlement with suppliers, then if someone goes out of business, it affects a lot of people.

But I'm still optimistic that this outbreak will bring the restaurant business to a standstill, for all of us, and then we'll all be back to square one. Still got to think positive. And compared to medium-sized catering enterprises, we are relatively small degree of impact, six months can not afford to open a shop. Originally, I took three stores after years, ready to expand the new store, but now also can only put on hold.

If the outbreak is effectively controlled, stores can open in February, but I estimate that there will be half a year, people may slowly and before the same consumption. Before the outbreak, I was thinking about making some quick-selling soups that you could take home with you, but we still have to change our traditional industry, and if we can't run a store, we have to think about other ways of making blood.

Now everyone is crying poor, there are some pessimistic statements, I do not like this, I think this is a reserve power period. Just like an entrepreneur who says he wants the landlord not to charge rent this month, I disagree. The landlord is also doing investment business and taking a lot of risks. This requirement is unreasonable and can not be a moral kidnapping. We should still think of self-help, the enterprise to do well, not to pass the difficulties to a third party.

According to the government regulation, the restaurant business must be closed down. Image / network

We're trapped. We have to survive

Wan Guoying, the owner of Qingyuan Bookstore

Our bookstore opened in 1992 and has been for 28 years now. A few days ago, I titled a Wechat Post, "please don't let me freeze to death in the wind and snow, " and I'm not exaggerating. This outbreak is the biggest crisis our bookstore has faced in 28 years.

On the 30th day of the Lunar New Year, our bookstore closed, usually on the 2nd day of the Lunar New Year, but now the bookstore can not open, online operation is also difficult, staff can not go to work, no one in the warehouse, logistics is either shut down or very expensive.

Qingyuan staff number 51 people, two stores Qingyuan, one 312 square meters, another 806 square meters, and more than 2000 square meters of distribution logistics warehouse, for more than 200 customers in Jiangxi Province distribution books and provide professional services. If it had been open, I would have had four million in cash flow from my 200 plus outlet stores, but that's all gone now.

There is no other source of funding after the bookstore closes, basic rent and staff salaries must be paid, and the existing funds can be maintained for up to two months, as December 2019 is the peak time for payment of suppliers, and January is the peak time for staff salaries and bonuses before the holidays, so there's barely any cash on the books.

So it's been a very difficult month or two for us, not making a profit, spending five hundred thousand a month, the store making very little profit, not having much cash flow, barely making ends meet. The longer the outbreak drags on, the more pressure it puts on us, and it will certainly take some time to recover after it opens on February 10th.

We also experienced SARS in 2003, when the control is not very strict, can open a shop, there are also book friends to buy books, not so much impact. But this time it was serious, and with the exception of the Xinhua Bookstore, many bookstores were fatally hit. Many private bookstores have a single business, relying only on book sales to maintain their daily operations, and the decline in book sales caused by the epidemic is almost precipitous, in addition, most private bookstores have to bear high rent, store rent and labor costs, the ability to resist risk is weak.

Jiangxi does the humanities and Social Sciences Bookstore, we are the best, 28 years we have also accumulated a lot of old customers, a few days ago we introduced the book friends readers to recharge the book card, can slightly alleviate the cash flow problem, but that's just to keep the store open. Moreover, it is impossible to rely on book friends and feelings all the time. We still need to have our own blood-making ability. We increased the construction of the children's section last year, and are also connecting the city's study and public library projects, to make up for the store sales mess.

I'm more concerned about the aftermath of the epidemic, and the fact that a lot of the books, like tutoring, are being sold online, is contributing to this trend. And then the publishing house to collect the funds, sell the goods as soon as possible, it is estimated that through various discounts to recover costs, these are very disadvantageous to us. At the end of last year, the physical bookstore was not in good condition. At the beginning of this year, when the epidemic hit, we were trapped there. There was nothing we could do but survive.

The grass roots are working overtime

An Wang, a civil servant in Zhejiang Province

I've been working since eighth grade. Because I am the deputy director of the unit office, this Spring Festival overtime work must be led by us, we first, and then others, the fourth day of the fourth required all civil servants on duty, start working. We are a little better, originally requested to resume work tomorrow, but late last night issued a notice, requiring all departments and institutions to start rotating duty, there is no recovery time.

Working overtime during the Spring Festival is not busy with other things. We have to make statistics on the situation of returning home and returning to work during the Spring Festival. More than 200 people in our unit started to figure out the arrangements on the first day of the first day of the Lunar New Year, but the situation above has changed quickly. The first day of the first day of the first day of the Lunar New Year was when the arrangements came into contact with Wuhan, then the outbreak spread to Wenzhou and Taizhou.

I basically go to work every day these days, phone contact, fill out forms, summary, sometimes a few hours a day to complete, sometimes until 10 pm, still have to forward documents, draft notice. I was still a little worried when I went to the office, but I always drove to the office, and I was the only one in the office, so I felt a little bit relieved.

Now we've equated the people from Wenzhou with the people from Hubei. Looking at the data from the day before yesterday, Wenzhou is the city with the largest number of newly diagnosed cases of pneumonia in the country except Hubei, surpassing many counties and cities in Hubei.

Many people do business in Wenzhou. After the city was shut down, another 18,000 people from Wuhan returned to Wenzhou. Yueqing is one of the hardest hit areas in Wenzhou. A friend of mine on the street, they had a meeting at midnight, looking for missing contacts, the street basically has no rest since the end of the year, there is no concept of New Year.

Units like ours are doing well, mainly because the functional departments are busy, especially at the grass-roots level. Transportation, health care, and medical staff were notified of the cancellation of their leave on the 30th of the Lunar New Year. The grass roots are overloaded, a street in Tongxiang, Zhejiang Province, missed a patient returning from Wuhan, and three leaders of the street and the community are held accountable.

The day before yesterday, family members in Wenzhou received news that the streets would be searched in a carpet-like manner in the residential area, registering identity card numbers and people's whereabouts. Such searches would last at least five days, and grass-roots civil servants would be under great pressure and have a greater workload, civil Servants Listen to the government's arrangements is also the duty, after the Spring Festival overtime will be given to rest, but the real hard work may be some grass-roots community non-staff personnel.

Do not work time, nest at home can only around the children, or envy no children, have children, very afraid of these turbulence, very hope to quickly control the epidemic, life or calm some good.

The emotions we've accumulated, they're all reflected in the stock market

Non-shareholders

The first a-share trading day after the Spring Festival in 2020 was supposed to be January 31, but due to the outbreak, it was rescheduled. I put it on my calendar in case I forgot the new date, but it turned out to be an unnecessary distraction -- it was the first trading day of the New Year, and everything that happened on February 3rd was unforgettable.

As usual, the stock market began to call for bids at 9 a.m. and waited until 9:30 to open. For the most part, this was the beginning of the unknown, and there was no telling whether it would go up or down, but by this morning, almost everyone knew the answer. Television stock review programs, push the Financial Review, even the bank's wealth managers will use a continuous screen of friends to warn you that today will be a big drop.

Chinese investors may be the most interesting investors in the world, with a unique sense of humor. Before the opening bell, someone said, even the fuse has seen, what else can there be today? As a result, more than 3,000 stocks fell by their daily limit during the bidding round alone. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets fell sharply at the start of the trading day, with more than 3,000 stocks falling together. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 7.72 per cent from the last day of trading before the holiday, its biggest one-day fall since August 2015. This means that whether you are chasing an index or a stock, the options column will probably have to be green losses.

I have always felt that the stock market is a laboratory for revealing human reactions and that it embodies one of the most honest market sentiments. In the ten days between the Spring Festival and the first working day, the fear, anxiety, anxiety and despair that people have accumulated because of the new pneumonia epidemic are reflected in the capital market on this day. The theme today, says the television presenter, is "to digest our fears. " .

But even on the bad days, there is some good news. PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT SPECIALIZE IN LAB supplies and face masks jumped on the day, and the cloud office and online education sectors were also up and running. When there's despair, there's hope. I was reminded of the technical definition of stock market analysis, in the K line chart for trading conditions, when a cross star appears at the bottom of a continuing decline, it means that everything is going to get better and that it is going to bottom out. It is called the star of hope. Today none of us can say when this cross will appear, but at every trough in history it has always appeared.
