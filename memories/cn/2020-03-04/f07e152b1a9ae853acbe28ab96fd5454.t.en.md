##The coders, the hairdressers, the entrepreneurs all went to deliver food

Southreviews

Functional presentation, the power of calm

Years from now, if Gao Weimo is still in the business, he will remember the special February 2nd in the spring of 2020. That day, the barber shop where he worked was still closed, the seat was gray, the rainbow light was off, and he tweeted, "Tony, " everywhere.

And he was delivering food on the streets of Nanjing.

Tony is a good-natured ribbing of the barber community. Under the epidemic, people do not go home for a month, men, women, young and old, hair tendril, have great nostalgia for the barber who did not care. Where's the barber? Some of them cut the hair of the medical staff who were going to be on the front line, reducing their chances of contracting the virus, while maintaining their beauty and dignity. But more people couldn't work because of the epidemic.

Jia Pengfei, a massage technician who was due to return to Shanghai on January 14, stayed in the small northern city of Baoji. The massage parlour had been closed, and everyone knew what they were doing without the owner saying it. Zhang Qi, a programmer who quit a few months ago and moved to a different city to start over, was overshadowed by the outbreak. It's not easy to find a job that pays in proportion to the rewards of a long winter. And Gao Peng, the owner of a car wash in Kunming and an entrepreneur born in the 1990s, watched his pregnant new wife delay the opening of the car wash, a business in the doldrums. The young man decided to take on the responsibilities of his father and husband no matter what.

They also opted to get on their bikes and start delivering food. The story of the four is a microcosm of the shift in employment patterns in China during the epidemic. Data from Meituan show that from January 20 to February 23,2020,75,000 workers became their new riders, a figure that is steadily increasing, the company is expected to provide more than 200,000 jobs nationwide in a combination of long-term employment and flexible employment.

Before becoming a horseman, Jia never really understood the delivery business. While working in Shanghai, he had a brief encounter with a delivery boy from Hunan Province in a convenience store. It was 10 p.m. , he bought a Bento and lay in the convenience store dining area, looking tired. From 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. , he's been on the street for 15 hours. Jia asked about his income, which he said ranged from 8,000 yuan to 12,000 yuan, sometimes as little as 7,000 yuan. Hard work -- an impression of a job as a rider.

Now, he's rediscovering the business. The job may seem simple, but it also requires a lot of service skills. A few days ago, because of hurry, spilled some soup, and he did not communicate well, the customer gave a bad review. There were some warm moments, though. Once, at 10:30 p.m. , when he delivered the food, he found that the customer had been waiting at the door for a long time. It was a cold night. The temperature was below zero. When he left, he told Jia Pengfei, "take care of yourself. ". Their story is the story of countless ordinary people in the epidemic. Life encountered difficulties, they choose to face, find a way out, but also re-examine the responsibility, family and love.
Here's what they say:

Zhang Qi, post-1990s, programmer, Yangzhou
It's not easy to find a job in a different city, and the take-out income is proportional to the effort

I've been delivering since February 3rd, less than a month. It's not a choice. It's a choice.

I'm 24 years old, from Henan Province, and I live in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province. Last job was code-typing, in Beijing. A career as a programmer may seem like a busy one, but it's actually different for different companies. There are the kind of overwork to death to live the company, but also business into a stable period, can be more regular to and from work. My old job was in the latter category.

Before the company is too leisurely, the work is quite relaxed, the feeling does not have the development prospect, also can not learn the thing. Our project manager stayed there for years to get that job. Sign a five-year contract, you can rock the car in Beijing, buy a house, but I do not want to live in that kind of life, left the office.

It was supposed to be a different company. There was some delay and I didn't look for a job for months. A while back, a well-connected guy on the Internet asked me if I wanted to come to Yangzhou. I am a very Buddhist, have been to many cities, we care about food, climate are indifferent, so in which city life does not matter. I didn't feel so good in Beijing. I was told I could change my environment. I thought I'd give it a try and come to Yangzhou.

Before, I thought Yangzhou was a second-tier city. There'd be jobs. When I got there, I realized there weren't that many positions available. The programmer job I was looking for, for example, wasn't that easy to find, and there wasn't much demand for it. The average wage in Yangzhou is no better, with basic jobs such as security guard and car wash workers earning as little as $3,000 to $4,000 a month.

Came here and rented an apartment. Do Not know the market at first, is in accordance with Beijing's heart rate rent. In fact, I found that the rent is too expensive, there is no way out. I can't go anywhere on New Year's Day. I'm staying in my apartment. I order takeout every day because I'm not a good cook.

I was going to look for a job years from now, but then I got caught up in this epidemic. The more companies did not hire during the outbreak, the less options were available. The apartment pays rent every month, so the plans don't really keep up. Anyway, at the end of the day, I think delivery is a good choice. When the rider threshold is low, although tired, compared to other jobs or higher wages.

Affected by the epidemic, recent orders are not particularly large. I usually don't have any orders in the morning. I don't go out until 9:00 or 10:00. I'm busy at lunch, and then I'm free again at 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon. After that, there weren't any orders. I'd be back by 8:00 or 9:00, so special times can be a buffer for a Newbie like me.

I used to order takeout all the time. In the most extreme case, I ordered a meal that took an hour longer to arrive. My friend was very angry when the rider explained that he had fallen, but I felt all right. Another time, I was so hungry that I had to order again. The first order didn't arrive until the meal was finished. The basic requirement for a customer to order food is to have it delivered in one piece and relatively quickly.

When I made my own delivery, I realized I was running out of time. We're a little short-handed, so we've had a few problems with the system lately. They're short-staffed and slow. There's a mall in the area we sent over, and they won't let riders in, so there's a list they need to drop off. Shops may be only one person, sometimes a lot of single together to do down.

I delivered one the other day, and by the time I got it, it was three minutes over. Plus, sometimes the navigation's a little off. Because of the outbreak, some of the roads are blocked, so it's GonNa be a little bit of a detour. All of this can lead to timeouts. However, during the outbreak, the community is not allowed to enter, things are put directly at the door, which has helped me save some time.

Maybe everyone from the rider to the customer has to make allowance for each other. The soup spilled two days ago, objectively speaking, the responsibility is not really me, the business lunch box is thin, all broken, the soup spilled, not shake out. That order is pickled cabbage fish, should be 48 yuan, I told the customer add wechat to compensate him.

$48. I said I'd pay for it. Didn't change the thought that someone like me, who makes five bucks a job, shouldn't think that way. But the customer went home and dealt with it, and told me it was free. They're actually pretty nice.

All the customers I've met so far have been kind of Nice. I made all the usual mistakes that novices face, such as running over time, spilling a meal or taking the wrong one. But the customer is quite considerate, perhaps this and I admit fault attitude is good also related, know wrong I admit fault.

Whether it's running outside in front of a computer or on an electric bike, it's work for me. Some of the older riders, almost all year round, and I'm only a month into it and I'm not particularly tired. I used to sit in the office every day, look at my computer, get off work on time, and have a Saturday weekend off, but of course the riders were more tired than me. But there is a good saying, "fear of fatigue when what riders, " to do riders is not because here pay proportional to income, as long as hard work, wages will be good.

I've been paying rent in Yangzhou for six months, just to see how things are, and to get used to the job and the city. I don't know what I'm GonNa do with my life. I've been writing code for a couple of months, and I'm not sure I'm going to be able to find a job in this situation. Of course, it's possible to become a good rider, get paid well, and stay in the business forever.

Jia Pengfei, massage technician born after 1980, Baoji, Shaanxi
If I hadn't changed my profession then, I would be a nurse in Wuhan now

On February 3rd, the 14th of the first month, my first day as a rider of Meituan, I delivered a total of seven orders.
The first order was a bowl of rice noodles. The customer was a woman in her 30s. The weather was fine and windy, the roads were deserted, shops were mostly closed and the streets were empty. She lives in a community of factory dormitories. She ran out of the building. I handed her a plastic bag of rice noodles through the door. She said thank you and turned away.
If it had not been for this outbreak, this would have been the day I returned to Shanghai. I'm a physical therapist at a massage parlor in Qingpu District. I have lived in Shanghai for 4 years and like the humid climate, civilization and refinement of the city. One detail that struck me was that in Shanghai, you can't just hand-feed people, you have to hand-feed them on a plate or on a tongs.
This year, I've been in the massage business for 11 years. The massage shop in Shanghai offers room and board, works 12 hours a day, works hard, gets a monthly salary of 8,000 yuan ~ 10,000 yuan. In Baoji, that's a lot of money. I had planned to stay in Shanghai and make some money for a few years, but the epidemic changed everything.
On January 20, I returned to Baoji from Shanghai for the Lunar New Year. Massage Parlors in Shanghai close as outbreak plummets. On the first day of the first lunar month, I discussed privately with my colleagues that the time for resuming work might be extended or even need to make other plans. The entire massage shop has a total of more than 40 employees, accommodation is no small expense. The boss doesn't say when to reopen, we don't ask questions, and everyone knows it.
After the seventh day of the first lunar month, there are seven or eight colleagues back to Shanghai, no wages so far, the boss only bear catering, but no longer bear the cost of accommodation. There are seven or eight people like me who work on the spot.
I had a family and I couldn't afford to be idle all the time, so I decided to stay in Baoji and become a Dolce & Gabbana rider. One of my childhood friends has been a horseman for nearly six months. We hadn't been in touch for a long time, he told me during a Spring Festival Chitchat. In Baoji, Meituan riders make good money, so he decided to give it a try.

I was born, raised and married in Baoji, a small Guanzhong city with a population smaller than a fraction of Shanghai's. The first day of the first lunar month, Shaanxi Province launched a public health emergency response. The panic spread to the small town where he grew up. Shops are closing, citizens are closing their doors, and take-out bikers are becoming the city's most wanted.
We all know what's at stake out there in the wild. But if we young and strong don't come out, who can we expect to come out? So, January 30, I through a friend, to see the current webmaster, the next day will receive a uniform. He's a rider on this site, too. We're colleagues now.
On my first day, at ten o'clock in the morning, the station master arranged for an old rider to accompany me with the delivery. He looked on and gave me instructions on how to take orders, pick up food and deliver food on my mobile phone. Typically, it takes 30 minutes from the rider to complete the delivery, which includes the restaurant's production time.
A little after two in the afternoon, I began to deliver food by myself. Because of the epidemic, our area, the only open shop is a beef noodle restaurant, a rice noodle restaurant, there are several supermarkets and pharmacies. Like any other city, the busiest place in Baoji is a hospital. In the small town of Guanzhong, fear is also spreading. The city suddenly empty, the citizens closed at home, quiet let me strange.
Because of the epidemic, I often think of my days as a nurse recently. I graduated from nursing and worked as a respiratory nurse before becoming a masseuse. After the Spring Festival, six former schoolmates have already gone to Wuhan one after another. In the news, I saw the medical care dinner to eat instant noodles, indescribable sad. If I didn't change careers then, I don't know if I'm in Wuhan now.
During the outbreak of SARS in 2003, I happened to be interning at a top three hospital in Jilin City, Jilin Province. Several of my classmates and I were transferred to the hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases support, responsible for the care and isolation of fever patients. At that time, the protection conditions are far better than today, no N95, protective clothing, goggles, only 48 layers of gauze mask. Every three hours, we need to change masks, wash them in hot water, disinfect them and dry them. Our gauze masks were hanging on the clothesline, white as a sheet. I was 19 years old, Youth, and had no idea what fear was, and several young nurses were still playing games with feverish patients in the ward.
Fortunately, there is not a single case of SARS in Jilin City, and we are all safe. However, the head nurse of that hospital went to Beijing Ditan Hospital to support. At that time, the hospital was called "SARS hospital" , admitted a large number of patients, medical infection rate is very high.
It was summer by the time she returned to the northeast. I've forgotten a lot of things, but I remember clearly, she said, in Beijing, when you stick a needle into a patient, you need to wear three layers of plastic gloves and a thick protective suit. "A good nurse needs to be able to feel as if she could find a vein and push a needle through even three layers of gloves, " she says.
Someone had to do something. She did what she had to do.

After graduation, my classmates and friends went to hospitals all over the country. I was young, I had a lot of desire, I had a lot of ideas. The nurse's salary is too low to satisfy me. After a short period of six months of medical work, I chose to leave Jilin and go to Xi'an to make a living. As I found out later, almost all the men who graduated that year switched careers.
In four or five years, I have held numerous jobs, including construction workers, eyeglass-grinding workers and so on. It wasn't until 2009 that I returned to nursing and became a masseuse. In the winter of 2015, in order to better development, I began to drift. Before I left Shaanxi, I got married. Shanghai's high housing prices made it impractical to settle down, so her wife stayed in Baoji.
Because of the epidemic, I re-examined my career choice and said no regrets was a lie. Life is not only short-term interests, as well as professional value, dignity and so on, could not understand, now understand is already middle-aged. If I had it to do over again, now that I've studied nursing, I'd go a lot further.

I admire those "retrograde" to Wuhan Students, this courage, not everyone has. One of the girls stayed in the ICU. A few days ago, she told us in a wechat account of the first-line Experience: a Ward, five nurses care for eight patients, one night, she changed 13 tanks of oxygen. A few days ago, she just menstrual period, because protective clothing precious, need to minimize wear off, a day of work, pants are wet.
My four-year-old is my Achilles heel. If I could earn a decent income as a rider and stay in Baoji to take care of my family, I would also consider a long-term career. More than 20 days passed, although there are grievances, there are unpleasant, but also harvest. My expected income is between 5,000 and 8,000. Now, enterprises have an orderly resumption of work, the road sometimes will be stuck in traffic, rush-hour orders began to more. I hope it gets better.

Gao Peng, post 90s entrepreneur, Kunming
My wife is four months pregnant. I want to make more money

Without the outbreak, I'd probably still be a take-out rider.
I was born in Kunming in 1992 and moved to Guangzhou and Shanghai before returning to Kunming a few years ago. When I got married last December, my wife was already pregnant. She was working at a nail salon, and she quit when she got married because of a pregnancy scare. When the days of eating alone and not being hungry were over, I suddenly realized my responsibilities as a husband and father.
Four years ago, my family and my cousin's family invested $500,000 to open a car wash. My brother and I are part of the operation, both as a boss and a worker. The car wash is now on the right track and the principal invested is almost back. In accordance with the agreement, in addition to the year-end bonus, my brother and I took turns to work at the car wash, receive a salary, 3000 yuan per month.
The baby's coming, and for me, it's not enough.
At the beginning of January, I began to look for a job in 58 different cities. Because I've been a driver and I own a car wash, my priority is getting a ride. But in Kunming, the water is deep. I saw some posts on the Internet, some people were black intermediary pit swindles, paid thousands of dollars did not drive on. So I started thinking about the job as a delivery rider, which is relatively free, flexible and not too high a bar.
After an interview, on January 20, I officially became a rider of Meituan. Say also coincidentally, the site in my house next door building, work, communication is very convenient. By then, my wife had gone back to her family, and I was living alone. Near the Spring Festival, Kunming is still busy, take-away orders a lot, busy time I can send 36 orders a day, up to a month can have 6000 yuan ~ 7000 yuan income.
Only three days later, however, the situation in Wuhan worsened and the atmosphere in Kunming became tense. The car wash is closed. No one leaves the house. On the first day of the first lunar month, I often delivered food to the community, there was a confirmed case.
I've only been on the job a few days, and this is totally unexpected. When my wife heard about it, she called me immediately. "stop running and go home, " she said anxiously.
I've thought about it, too. Forget about the pay. quit and go home. I didn't know if I was safe. What if I went home and infected her? Besides, this is the first official job four or five years after starting a business, and it's irresponsible to run away from it. On three, I decided not to go home and keep delivering.

The Spring Festival was originally the peak season for tourism in Yunnan Province. Because of the epidemic situation, the tourism market slipped into the freezing point. Fewer people, tourist attractions closed, the public is closed, take-away orders significantly reduced. Only a few restaurants, fruit shops and drug stores remain open in the city. This winter, the weather in Kunming is colder than usual, and it snowed on the first day of the first lunar month.
My wife calls me every day, asking about my health and taking precautions. She holds a cell phone every day waiting for my message, I sent her Wechat, she is always "seconds back. ". She's four months pregnant, and she's having a really bad reaction to the pregnancy, and I feel so guilty for worrying about it.
I've also sent hospital orders for fruit, meals, and so on, some to doctors, some to The Adventure of the Resident Patient. During the Spring Festival, Meituan is no contact with the distribution, so I do not have special fear. Besides, when disaster does come, fear is useless. But I never tell my parents or my wife that I deliver food to the hospital.
The impact of the outbreak on the car wash quickly became apparent. Usually, we open on the sixth day of the first lunar month. Around the eighth day is the best business days, a day to wash more than 70 cars, sometimes even too busy to eat breakfast. This year, the opening was delayed again and again until Feb. 26 because of the epidemic. And, even when it was open, business was unusually quiet.
Our car wash has 200 square meters, a year's rent is 120,000, closed for a day is not a small loss. Now that I think about it, I made the right choice coming out here as a rider, and it took a lot off my shoulders.
I did not go to university, 18-year-old out of work, in a chemical plant as a worker, salary 2400 yuan per month, factory food and shelter. After I quit the factory, I worked as a worker on the construction site my uncle contracted, as a driver with my driver's license, and as a worker in Shanghai and Guangzhou. Time flies, flash has been ten years. It remains to be seen when business at the car wash will return to normal. But I remain optimistic that the epidemic will pass.
Now, Kunming has begun to resume work in an orderly manner, take-out orders gradually increased, I can send more than 30 orders every day. Spring warm weather, the wind and Sunny, on the road does not feel hard.

On New Year's Eve, my wife and I had a quarrel over some trifles. "You don't want to come back to this house and never come back, " she said angrily over the phone. I had a bad temper and was angry and didn't come home that day. On the first day of the first lunar month, the food delivery community found a confirmed case, I can not go back. And for that, I have been filled with guilt. When the outbreak is over, I want to make it up to her.
Car Wash is my business, and if it's going well, I'd like to open a branch in the future. As for the Jockey Job, I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it, but I'll do my job every single day.
Gao Weimo, hairdresser after 1995, Nanjing
Save up for special occasions, support small dreams

I was born in'98. I've been delivering food in Nanjing for almost a month. My hometown is Fengyang County, Fengyang County is very close to Nanjing, more than two hours drive, there are a lot of people in my hometown work in Nanjing.
In the summer of 2018, after graduating from high school, I didn't get into a good school and didn't want to repeat my studies, so I came to Nanjing. Fengyang County's a small town, but after graduation, I thought I'd try it out. My parents also work in Nanjing, my father in the chemical plant, my mother in the Electronics Factory. They also wanted to take me to the factory, I think in the factory too boring, or want to learn a trade.
I saw a barber shop to recruit apprentices, think this industry "pretty cool" , want to learn hairdressing, the future can own a shop.
Learned more than a year, is now an apprentice, feeling that this industry cycle is a bit long, generally three or four years to learn, a bit shaken. Before more than a year, each month can only earn more than a thousand, living or need some family subsidies.
Before the Spring Festival I saw the news on the Internet, said Wuhan there pneumonia, did not feel very serious, I went home on January 19 the New Year. After the New Year, I returned to Nanjing on the 27th, when the bus was still open, and then the village road was closed.
On the way to Nanjing, I felt the epidemic was getting worse. Get on and get off the car to check the body temperature, in the Jiangsu-anhui junction of the place also checked once, when entering Nanjing, also scan Qr Code Registration. After arriving, and in the home isolation for 14 days, after getting a certificate issued by the Neighborhood Committee to go out.
I knew when I got here that the barbershop wasn't open, and I had to give notice when it was.
But I don't think I can sit around. In the home quarantine, I began to look for work on the Internet, in 58 with the city to see the United States group in the recruitment of riders, signed up. After the interview, they assigned me to a station on Nangang's side.
At first it was training. I ran with the master for two days to familiarize myself with the whole food delivery process. Special period, before Mount Guard still did safety training, basically speak epidemic situation and traffic safety. Meituan gave us masks to change every four hours at work, disposable gloves, alcohol, and hand sanitizer.
Every morning, the site will give the rider unified disinfection, each time to send a single and back to the site, and again to disinfection. The mask stays on at all times. You can't go to the mall to pick up food without a mask, or you might look like a monster. Each rider is also equipped with a safety card, to record the daily temperature, disinfection, and then take photos and upload.

The outbreak is serious, Meituan launched a "no contact distribution. ". In the business after the meal, is generally delivered to the designated area at the door, and then inform the customer down to take. Most of the neighborhoods are now inaccessible, so they have to be delivered to the door.
I've had customers who were difficult to talk to, who insisted I take them upstairs, who didn't believe my explanation, and who said they wanted to complain about me. I stood at the gate of the community said for a long time, and finally there is no way, security sent him over. It's a pain in the neck to have to deal with such a difficult customer.
Most of the customers are fine. Someone will tell you to put your food in the right place, take a picture, and you won't have to wait. And the customers would say, "well, it's been hard for you guys to deliver food, and I think that's very sweet. ".
Once a customer ordered soup buns and noodles. I thought I'd deliver them quickly. The noodles wouldn't taste good once they were dry. After they arrived, he gave me a reward of $8.80. I don't care about the money, but the customers give me good reviews. Another time, I sent a single to the SWAT team, the order of the sister wrote on the remarks: The husband remember to pay attention to protection, and then busy also have a good rest, eat on time. I find all of this heartwarming.
There are two hospitals around our station, one is Nangang Hospital, the other is Zhongda Hospital. I have been there many times. Before nervous, Nangang Hospital from a distance from the gate there is a temperature measurement point, but also to register identity card number, food delivery should be placed in the food, can not go upstairs. You can send it upstairs in the next two days.
These two hospitals are not designated hospitals, now very few people. I don't feel nervous either. I just need to be protected. There's no need to stress myself out.
Most of the orders at the hospital are from the paramedics. I sent to the hospital, a nurse sister ordered a few fried rice, she told me, now the epidemic is serious, you out of food delivery is not easy, also gave me a bottle of yogurt, my heart is very warm. I didn't have anything else, I had to bring them food, and it wasn't easy for them, and I thought to myself, let's get it over to them so they can have a hot meal.
After the beauty industry, a month in Nanjing can get a few thousand, but the competition is still fierce, also very hard. It's open at 9:00 every morning, and if anyone comes in for a perm at night, it'll have to wait until it's done.
I didn't think much of it when I was looking for a job as a rider, and I figured as long as the protection was good, I should be okay. Because the delivery guy was always at work, and I wasn't alone, and the street sweeper was working. The shops on the street have been slowly opening for the past two days.
I used to think it wasn't easy for the takeout industry to run around every day. Now I work eight or nine hours a day, three shifts in the morning, noon and night, and can choose to take a day off each week. I am a novice, every day to send 30 or 40 single bar, calculate, plus bonuses and subsidies and so on, should be able to get four or five thousand dollars.

I am an only child, parents were very worried at first, they said the delivery contact people, I explained to them, will do their own protection, the site will also give us disinfection. They haven't even started their factories yet. They're back home.
I figured I'd stick around for a while after the epidemic, deliver the food, save some money for myself. After that, I still want to learn a trade, see if there is any good industry. Many of my family members open restaurants here, and other industries to work, I may also consider learning to cook something.
People have a little dream, I still want to have some savings, to support their little dream.

Years from now, if Gao Weimo is still in the business, he will remember the special February 2nd in the spring of 2020. That day, the barber shop where he worked was still closed, the seat was gray, the rainbow light was off, and he tweeted, "Tony, " everywhere.

And he was delivering food on the streets of Nanjing.

Tony is a good-natured ribbing of the barber community. Under the epidemic, people do not go home for a month, men, women, young and old, hair tendril, have great nostalgia for the barber who did not care. Where's the barber? Some of them cut the hair of the medical staff who were going to be on the front line, reducing their chances of contracting the virus, while maintaining their beauty and dignity. But more people couldn't work because of the epidemic.

Jia Pengfei, a massage technician who was due to return to Shanghai on January 14, stayed in the small northern city of Baoji. The massage parlour had been closed, and everyone knew what they were doing without the owner saying it. Zhang Qi, a programmer who quit a few months ago and moved to a different city to start over, was overshadowed by the outbreak. It's not easy to find a job that pays in proportion to the rewards of a long winter. And Gao Peng, the owner of a car wash in Kunming and an entrepreneur born in the 1990s, watched his pregnant new wife delay the opening of the car wash, a business in the doldrums. The young man decided to take on the responsibilities of his father and husband no matter what.

They also opted to get on their bikes and start delivering food. The story of the four is a microcosm of the shift in employment patterns in China during the epidemic. Data from Meituan show that from January 20 to February 23,2020,75,000 workers became their new riders, a figure that is steadily increasing, the company is expected to provide more than 200,000 jobs nationwide in a combination of long-term employment and flexible employment.

Before becoming a horseman, Jia never really understood the delivery business. While working in Shanghai, he had a brief encounter with a delivery boy from Hunan Province in a convenience store. It was 10 p.m. , he bought a Bento and lay in the convenience store dining area, looking tired. From 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. , he's been on the street for 15 hours. Jia asked about his income, which he said ranged from 8,000 yuan to 12,000 yuan, sometimes as little as 7,000 yuan. Hard work -- an impression of a job as a rider.

Now, he's rediscovering the business. The job may seem simple, but it also requires a lot of service skills. A few days ago, because of hurry, spilled some soup, and he did not communicate well, the customer gave a bad review. There were some warm moments, though. Once, at 10:30 p.m. , when he delivered the food, he found that the customer had been waiting at the door for a long time. It was a cold night. The temperature was below zero. When he left, he told Jia Pengfei, "take care of yourself. ". Their story is the story of countless ordinary people in the epidemic. Life encountered difficulties, they choose to face, find a way out, but also re-examine the responsibility, family and love.
Here's what they say:

Zhang Qi, post-1990s, programmer, Yangzhou
It's not easy to find a job in a different city, and the take-out income is proportional to the effort

I've been delivering since February 3rd, less than a month. It's not a choice. It's a choice.

I'm 24 years old, from Henan Province, and I live in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province. Last job was code-typing, in Beijing. A career as a programmer may seem like a busy one, but it's actually different for different companies. There are the kind of overwork to death to live the company, but also business into a stable period, can be more regular to and from work. My old job was in the latter category.

Before the company is too leisurely, the work is quite relaxed, the feeling does not have the development prospect, also can not learn the thing. Our project manager stayed there for years to get that job. Sign a five-year contract, you can rock the car in Beijing, buy a house, but I do not want to live in that kind of life, left the office.

It was supposed to be a different company. There was some delay and I didn't look for a job for months. A while back, a well-connected guy on the Internet asked me if I wanted to come to Yangzhou. I am a very Buddhist, have been to many cities, we care about food, climate are indifferent, so in which city life does not matter. I didn't feel so good in Beijing. I was told I could change my environment. I thought I'd give it a try and come to Yangzhou.

Before, I thought Yangzhou was a second-tier city. There'd be jobs. When I got there, I realized there weren't that many positions available. The programmer job I was looking for, for example, wasn't that easy to find, and there wasn't much demand for it. The average wage in Yangzhou is no better, with basic jobs such as security guard and car wash workers earning as little as $3,000 to $4,000 a month.

Came here and rented an apartment. Do Not know the market at first, is in accordance with Beijing's heart rate rent. In fact, I found that the rent is too expensive, there is no way out. I can't go anywhere on New Year's Day. I'm staying in my apartment. I order takeout every day because I'm not a good cook.

I was going to look for a job years from now, but then I got caught up in this epidemic. The more companies did not hire during the outbreak, the less options were available. The apartment pays rent every month, so the plans don't really keep up. Anyway, at the end of the day, I think delivery is a good choice. When the rider threshold is low, although tired, compared to other jobs or higher wages.

Affected by the epidemic, recent orders are not particularly large. I usually don't have any orders in the morning. I don't go out until 9:00 or 10:00. I'm busy at lunch, and then I'm free again at 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon. After that, there weren't any orders. I'd be back by 8:00 or 9:00, so special times can be a buffer for a Newbie like me.

I used to order takeout all the time. In the most extreme case, I ordered a meal that took an hour longer to arrive. My friend was very angry when the rider explained that he had fallen, but I felt all right. Another time, I was so hungry that I had to order again. The first order didn't arrive until the meal was finished. The basic requirement for a customer to order food is to have it delivered in one piece and relatively quickly.

When I made my own delivery, I realized I was running out of time. We're a little short-handed, so we've had a few problems with the system lately. They're short-staffed and slow. There's a mall in the area we sent over, and they won't let riders in, so there's a list they need to drop off. Shops may be only one person, sometimes a lot of single together to do down.

I delivered one the other day, and by the time I got it, it was three minutes over. Plus, sometimes the navigation's a little off. Because of the outbreak, some of the roads are blocked, so it's GonNa be a little bit of a detour. All of this can lead to timeouts. However, during the outbreak, the community is not allowed to enter, things are put directly at the door, which has helped me save some time.

Maybe everyone from the rider to the customer has to make allowance for each other. The soup spilled two days ago, objectively speaking, the responsibility is not really me, the business lunch box is thin, all broken, the soup spilled, not shake out. That order is pickled cabbage fish, should be 48 yuan, I told the customer add wechat to compensate him.

$48. I said I'd pay for it. Didn't change the thought that someone like me, who makes five bucks a job, shouldn't think that way. But the customer went home and dealt with it, and told me it was free. They're actually pretty nice.

All the customers I've met so far have been kind of Nice. I made all the usual mistakes that novices face, such as running over time, spilling a meal or taking the wrong one. But the customer is quite considerate, perhaps this and I admit fault attitude is good also related, know wrong I admit fault.

Whether it's running outside in front of a computer or on an electric bike, it's work for me. Some of the older riders, almost all year round, and I'm only a month into it and I'm not particularly tired. I used to sit in the office every day, look at my computer, get off work on time, and have a Saturday weekend off, but of course the riders were more tired than me. But there is a good saying, "fear of fatigue when what riders, " to do riders is not because here pay proportional to income, as long as hard work, wages will be good.

I've been paying rent in Yangzhou for six months, just to see how things are, and to get used to the job and the city. I don't know what I'm GonNa do with my life. I've been writing code for a couple of months, and I'm not sure I'm going to be able to find a job in this situation. Of course, it's possible to become a good rider, get paid well, and stay in the business forever.

Jia Pengfei, massage technician born after 1980, Baoji, Shaanxi
If I hadn't changed my profession then, I would be a nurse in Wuhan now

On February 3rd, the 14th of the first month, my first day as a rider of Meituan, I delivered a total of seven orders.
The first order was a bowl of rice noodles. The customer was a woman in her 30s. The weather was fine and windy, the roads were deserted, shops were mostly closed and the streets were empty. She lives in a community of factory dormitories. She ran out of the building. I handed her a plastic bag of rice noodles through the door. She said thank you and turned away.
If it had not been for this outbreak, this would have been the day I returned to Shanghai. I'm a physical therapist at a massage parlor in Qingpu District. I have lived in Shanghai for 4 years and like the humid climate, civilization and refinement of the city. One detail that struck me was that in Shanghai, you can't just hand-feed people, you have to hand-feed them on a plate or on a tongs.
This year, I've been in the massage business for 11 years. The massage shop in Shanghai offers room and board, works 12 hours a day, works hard, gets a monthly salary of 8,000 yuan ~ 10,000 yuan. In Baoji, that's a lot of money. I had planned to stay in Shanghai and make some money for a few years, but the epidemic changed everything.
On January 20, I returned to Baoji from Shanghai for the Lunar New Year. Massage Parlors in Shanghai close as outbreak plummets. On the first day of the first lunar month, I discussed privately with my colleagues that the time for resuming work might be extended or even need to make other plans. The entire massage shop has a total of more than 40 employees, accommodation is no small expense. The boss doesn't say when to reopen, we don't ask questions, and everyone knows it.
After the seventh day of the first lunar month, there are seven or eight colleagues back to Shanghai, no wages so far, the boss only bear catering, but no longer bear the cost of accommodation. There are seven or eight people like me who work on the spot.
I had a family and I couldn't afford to be idle all the time, so I decided to stay in Baoji and become a Dolce & Gabbana rider. One of my childhood friends has been a horseman for nearly six months. We hadn't been in touch for a long time, he told me during a Spring Festival Chitchat. In Baoji, Meituan riders make good money, so he decided to give it a try.

I was born, raised and married in Baoji, a small Guanzhong city with a population smaller than a fraction of Shanghai's. The first day of the first lunar month, Shaanxi Province launched a public health emergency response. The panic spread to the small town where he grew up. Shops are closing, citizens are closing their doors, and take-out bikers are becoming the city's most wanted.
We all know what's at stake out there in the wild. But if we young and strong don't come out, who can we expect to come out? So, January 30, I through a friend, to see the current webmaster, the next day will receive a uniform. He's a rider on this site, too. We're colleagues now.
On my first day, at ten o'clock in the morning, the station master arranged for an old rider to accompany me with the delivery. He looked on and gave me instructions on how to take orders, pick up food and deliver food on my mobile phone. Typically, it takes 30 minutes from the rider to complete the delivery, which includes the restaurant's production time.
A little after two in the afternoon, I began to deliver food by myself. Because of the epidemic, our area, the only open shop is a beef noodle restaurant, a rice noodle restaurant, there are several supermarkets and pharmacies. Like any other city, the busiest place in Baoji is a hospital. In the small town of Guanzhong, fear is also spreading. The city suddenly empty, the citizens closed at home, quiet let me strange.
Because of the epidemic, I often think of my days as a nurse recently. I graduated from nursing and worked as a respiratory nurse before becoming a masseuse. After the Spring Festival, six former schoolmates have already gone to Wuhan one after another. In the news, I saw the medical care dinner to eat instant noodles, indescribable sad. If I didn't change careers then, I don't know if I'm in Wuhan now.
During the outbreak of SARS in 2003, I happened to be interning at a top three hospital in Jilin City, Jilin Province. Several of my classmates and I were transferred to the hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases support, responsible for the care and isolation of fever patients. At that time, the protection conditions are far better than today, no N95, protective clothing, goggles, only 48 layers of gauze mask. Every three hours, we need to change masks, wash them in hot water, disinfect them and dry them. Our gauze masks were hanging on the clothesline, white as a sheet. I was 19 years old, Youth, and had no idea what fear was, and several young nurses were still playing games with feverish patients in the ward.
Fortunately, there is not a single case of SARS in Jilin City, and we are all safe. However, the head nurse of that hospital went to Beijing Ditan Hospital to support. At that time, the hospital was called "SARS hospital" , admitted a large number of patients, medical infection rate is very high.
It was summer by the time she returned to the northeast. I've forgotten a lot of things, but I remember clearly, she said, in Beijing, when you stick a needle into a patient, you need to wear three layers of plastic gloves and a thick protective suit. "A good nurse needs to be able to feel as if she could find a vein and push a needle through even three layers of gloves, " she says.
Someone had to do something. She did what she had to do.

After graduation, my classmates and friends went to hospitals all over the country. I was young, I had a lot of desire, I had a lot of ideas. The nurse's salary is too low to satisfy me. After a short period of six months of medical work, I chose to leave Jilin and go to Xi'an to make a living. As I found out later, almost all the men who graduated that year switched careers.
In four or five years, I have held numerous jobs, including construction workers, eyeglass-grinding workers and so on. It wasn't until 2009 that I returned to nursing and became a masseuse. In the winter of 2015, in order to better development, I began to drift. Before I left Shaanxi, I got married. Shanghai's high housing prices made it impractical to settle down, so her wife stayed in Baoji.
Because of the epidemic, I re-examined my career choice and said no regrets was a lie. Life is not only short-term interests, as well as professional value, dignity and so on, could not understand, now understand is already middle-aged. If I had it to do over again, now that I've studied nursing, I'd go a lot further.

I admire those "retrograde" to Wuhan Students, this courage, not everyone has. One of the girls stayed in the ICU. A few days ago, she told us in a wechat account of the first-line Experience: a Ward, five nurses care for eight patients, one night, she changed 13 tanks of oxygen. A few days ago, she just menstrual period, because protective clothing precious, need to minimize wear off, a day of work, pants are wet.
My four-year-old is my Achilles heel. If I could earn a decent income as a rider and stay in Baoji to take care of my family, I would also consider a long-term career. More than 20 days passed, although there are grievances, there are unpleasant, but also harvest. My expected income is between 5,000 and 8,000. Now, enterprises have an orderly resumption of work, the road sometimes will be stuck in traffic, rush-hour orders began to more. I hope it gets better.

Gao Peng, post 90s entrepreneur, Kunming
My wife is four months pregnant. I want to make more money

Without the outbreak, I'd probably still be a take-out rider.
I was born in Kunming in 1992 and moved to Guangzhou and Shanghai before returning to Kunming a few years ago. When I got married last December, my wife was already pregnant. She was working at a nail salon, and she quit when she got married because of a pregnancy scare. When the days of eating alone and not being hungry were over, I suddenly realized my responsibilities as a husband and father.
Four years ago, my family and my cousin's family invested $500,000 to open a car wash. My brother and I are part of the operation, both as a boss and a worker. The car wash is now on the right track and the principal invested is almost back. In accordance with the agreement, in addition to the year-end bonus, my brother and I took turns to work at the car wash, receive a salary, 3000 yuan per month.
The baby's coming, and for me, it's not enough.
At the beginning of January, I began to look for a job in 58 different cities. Because I've been a driver and I own a car wash, my priority is getting a ride. But in Kunming, the water is deep. I saw some posts on the Internet, some people were black intermediary pit swindles, paid thousands of dollars did not drive on. So I started thinking about the job as a delivery rider, which is relatively free, flexible and not too high a bar.
After an interview, on January 20, I officially became a rider of Meituan. Say also coincidentally, the site in my house next door building, work, communication is very convenient. By then, my wife had gone back to her family, and I was living alone. Near the Spring Festival, Kunming is still busy, take-away orders a lot, busy time I can send 36 orders a day, up to a month can have 6000 yuan ~ 7000 yuan income.
Only three days later, however, the situation in Wuhan worsened and the atmosphere in Kunming became tense. The car wash is closed. No one leaves the house. On the first day of the first lunar month, I often delivered food to the community, there was a confirmed case.
I've only been on the job a few days, and this is totally unexpected. When my wife heard about it, she called me immediately. "stop running and go home, " she said anxiously.
I've thought about it, too. Forget about the pay. quit and go home. I didn't know if I was safe. What if I went home and infected her? Besides, this is the first official job four or five years after starting a business, and it's irresponsible to run away from it. On three, I decided not to go home and keep delivering.

The Spring Festival was originally the peak season for tourism in Yunnan Province. Because of the epidemic situation, the tourism market slipped into the freezing point. Fewer people, tourist attractions closed, the public is closed, take-away orders significantly reduced. Only a few restaurants, fruit shops and drug stores remain open in the city. This winter, the weather in Kunming is colder than usual, and it snowed on the first day of the first lunar month.
My wife calls me every day, asking about my health and taking precautions. She holds a cell phone every day waiting for my message, I sent her Wechat, she is always "seconds back. ". She's four months pregnant, and she's having a really bad reaction to the pregnancy, and I feel so guilty for worrying about it.
I've also sent hospital orders for fruit, meals, and so on, some to doctors, some to The Adventure of the Resident Patient. During the Spring Festival, Meituan is no contact with the distribution, so I do not have special fear. Besides, when disaster does come, fear is useless. But I never tell my parents or my wife that I deliver food to the hospital.
The impact of the outbreak on the car wash quickly became apparent. Usually, we open on the sixth day of the first lunar month. Around the eighth day is the best business days, a day to wash more than 70 cars, sometimes even too busy to eat breakfast. This year, the opening was delayed again and again until Feb. 26 because of the epidemic. And, even when it was open, business was unusually quiet.
Our car wash has 200 square meters, a year's rent is 120,000, closed for a day is not a small loss. Now that I think about it, I made the right choice coming out here as a rider, and it took a lot off my shoulders.
I did not go to university, 18-year-old out of work, in a chemical plant as a worker, salary 2400 yuan per month, factory food and shelter. After I quit the factory, I worked as a worker on the construction site my uncle contracted, as a driver with my driver's license, and as a worker in Shanghai and Guangzhou. Time flies, flash has been ten years. It remains to be seen when business at the car wash will return to normal. But I remain optimistic that the epidemic will pass.
Now, Kunming has begun to resume work in an orderly manner, take-out orders gradually increased, I can send more than 30 orders every day. Spring warm weather, the wind and Sunny, on the road does not feel hard.

On New Year's Eve, my wife and I had a quarrel over some trifles. "You don't want to come back to this house and never come back, " she said angrily over the phone. I had a bad temper and was angry and didn't come home that day. On the first day of the first lunar month, the food delivery community found a confirmed case, I can not go back. And for that, I have been filled with guilt. When the outbreak is over, I want to make it up to her.
Car Wash is my business, and if it's going well, I'd like to open a branch in the future. As for the Jockey Job, I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it, but I'll do my job every single day.
Gao Weimo, hairdresser after 1995, Nanjing
Save up for special occasions, support small dreams

I was born in'98. I've been delivering food in Nanjing for almost a month. My hometown is Fengyang County, Fengyang County is very close to Nanjing, more than two hours drive, there are a lot of people in my hometown work in Nanjing.
In the summer of 2018, after graduating from high school, I didn't get into a good school and didn't want to repeat my studies, so I came to Nanjing. Fengyang County's a small town, but after graduation, I thought I'd try it out. My parents also work in Nanjing, my father in the chemical plant, my mother in the Electronics Factory. They also wanted to take me to the factory, I think in the factory too boring, or want to learn a trade.
I saw a barber shop to recruit apprentices, think this industry "pretty cool" , want to learn hairdressing, the future can own a shop.
Learned more than a year, is now an apprentice, feeling that this industry cycle is a bit long, generally three or four years to learn, a bit shaken. Before more than a year, each month can only earn more than a thousand, living or need some family subsidies.
Before the Spring Festival I saw the news on the Internet, said Wuhan there pneumonia, did not feel very serious, I went home on January 19 the New Year. After the New Year, I returned to Nanjing on the 27th, when the bus was still open, and then the village road was closed.
On the way to Nanjing, I felt the epidemic was getting worse. Get on and get off the car to check the body temperature, in the Jiangsu-anhui junction of the place also checked once, when entering Nanjing, also scan Qr Code Registration. After arriving, and in the home isolation for 14 days, after getting a certificate issued by the Neighborhood Committee to go out.
I knew when I got here that the barbershop wasn't open, and I had to give notice when it was.
But I don't think I can sit around. In the home quarantine, I began to look for work on the Internet, in 58 with the city to see the United States group in the recruitment of riders, signed up. After the interview, they assigned me to a station on Nangang's side.
At first it was training. I ran with the master for two days to familiarize myself with the whole food delivery process. Special period, before Mount Guard still did safety training, basically speak epidemic situation and traffic safety. Meituan gave us masks to change every four hours at work, disposable gloves, alcohol, and hand sanitizer.
Every morning, the site will give the rider unified disinfection, each time to send a single and back to the site, and again to disinfection. The mask stays on at all times. You can't go to the mall to pick up food without a mask, or you might look like a monster. Each rider is also equipped with a safety card, to record the daily temperature, disinfection, and then take photos and upload.

The outbreak is serious, Meituan launched a "no contact distribution. ". In the business after the meal, is generally delivered to the designated area at the door, and then inform the customer down to take. Most of the neighborhoods are now inaccessible, so they have to be delivered to the door.
I've had customers who were difficult to talk to, who insisted I take them upstairs, who didn't believe my explanation, and who said they wanted to complain about me. I stood at the gate of the community said for a long time, and finally there is no way, security sent him over. It's a pain in the neck to have to deal with such a difficult customer.
Most of the customers are fine. Someone will tell you to put your food in the right place, take a picture, and you won't have to wait. And the customers would say, "well, it's been hard for you guys to deliver food, and I think that's very sweet. ".
Once a customer ordered soup buns and noodles. I thought I'd deliver them quickly. The noodles wouldn't taste good once they were dry. After they arrived, he gave me a reward of $8.80. I don't care about the money, but the customers give me good reviews. Another time, I sent a single to the SWAT team, the order of the sister wrote on the remarks: The husband remember to pay attention to protection, and then busy also have a good rest, eat on time. I find all of this heartwarming.
There are two hospitals around our station, one is Nangang Hospital, the other is Zhongda Hospital. I have been there many times. Before nervous, Nangang Hospital from a distance from the gate there is a temperature measurement point, but also to register identity card number, food delivery should be placed in the food, can not go upstairs. You can send it upstairs in the next two days.
These two hospitals are not designated hospitals, now very few people. I don't feel nervous either. I just need to be protected. There's no need to stress myself out.
Most of the orders at the hospital are from the paramedics. I sent to the hospital, a nurse sister ordered a few fried rice, she told me, now the epidemic is serious, you out of food delivery is not easy, also gave me a bottle of yogurt, my heart is very warm. I didn't have anything else, I had to bring them food, and it wasn't easy for them, and I thought to myself, let's get it over to them so they can have a hot meal.
After the beauty industry, a month in Nanjing can get a few thousand, but the competition is still fierce, also very hard. It's open at 9:00 every morning, and if anyone comes in for a perm at night, it'll have to wait until it's done.
I didn't think much of it when I was looking for a job as a rider, and I figured as long as the protection was good, I should be okay. Because the delivery guy was always at work, and I wasn't alone, and the street sweeper was working. The shops on the street have been slowly opening for the past two days.
I used to think it wasn't easy for the takeout industry to run around every day. Now I work eight or nine hours a day, three shifts in the morning, noon and night, and can choose to take a day off each week. I am a novice, every day to send 30 or 40 single bar, calculate, plus bonuses and subsidies and so on, should be able to get four or five thousand dollars.

I am an only child, parents were very worried at first, they said the delivery contact people, I explained to them, will do their own protection, the site will also give us disinfection. They haven't even started their factories yet. They're back home.
I figured I'd stick around for a while after the epidemic, deliver the food, save some money for myself. After that, I still want to learn a trade, see if there is any good industry. Many of my family members open restaurants here, and other industries to work, I may also consider learning to cook something.
People have a little dream, I still want to have some savings, to support their little dream.

This article represents the author's point of view, not the platform position

Years from now, if Gao Weimo is still in the business, he will remember the special February 2nd in the spring of 2020. That day, the barber shop where he worked was still closed, the seat was gray, the rainbow light was off, and he tweeted, "Tony, " everywhere.

And he was delivering food on the streets of Nanjing.

Tony is a good-natured ribbing of the barber community. Under the epidemic, people do not go home for a month, men, women, young and old, hair tendril, have great nostalgia for the barber who did not care. Where's the barber? Some of them cut the hair of the medical staff who were going to be on the front line, reducing their chances of contracting the virus, while maintaining their beauty and dignity. But more people couldn't work because of the epidemic.

Jia Pengfei, a massage technician who was due to return to Shanghai on January 14, stayed in the small northern city of Baoji. The massage parlour had been closed, and everyone knew what they were doing without the owner saying it. Zhang Qi, a programmer who quit a few months ago and moved to a different city to start over, was overshadowed by the outbreak. It's not easy to find a job that pays in proportion to the rewards of a long winter. And Gao Peng, the owner of a car wash in Kunming and an entrepreneur born in the 1990s, watched his pregnant new wife delay the opening of the car wash, a business in the doldrums. The young man decided to take on the responsibilities of his father and husband no matter what.

They also opted to get on their bikes and start delivering food. The story of the four is a microcosm of the shift in employment patterns in China during the epidemic. Data from Meituan show that from January 20 to February 23,2020,75,000 workers became their new riders, a figure that is steadily increasing, the company is expected to provide more than 200,000 jobs nationwide in a combination of long-term employment and flexible employment.

Before becoming a horseman, Jia never really understood the delivery business. While working in Shanghai, he had a brief encounter with a delivery boy from Hunan Province in a convenience store. It was 10 p.m. , he bought a Bento and lay in the convenience store dining area, looking tired. From 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. , he's been on the street for 15 hours. Jia asked about his income, which he said ranged from 8,000 yuan to 12,000 yuan, sometimes as little as 7,000 yuan. Hard work -- an impression of a job as a rider.

Now, he's rediscovering the business. The job may seem simple, but it also requires a lot of service skills. A few days ago, because of hurry, spilled some soup, and he did not communicate well, the customer gave a bad review. There were some warm moments, though. Once, at 10:30 p.m. , when he delivered the food, he found that the customer had been waiting at the door for a long time. It was a cold night. The temperature was below zero. When he left, he told Jia Pengfei, "take care of yourself. ". Their story is the story of countless ordinary people in the epidemic. Life encountered difficulties, they choose to face, find a way out, but also re-examine the responsibility, family and love.

Here's what they say:

##

##Zhang Qi, post-1990s, programmer, Yangzhou

##It's not easy to find a job in a different city, and the take-out income is proportional to the effort

I've been delivering since February 3rd, less than a month. It's not a choice. It's a choice.

I'm 24 years old, from Henan Province, and I live in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province. Last job was code-typing, in Beijing. A career as a programmer may seem like a busy one, but it's actually different for different companies. There are the kind of overwork to death to live the company, but also business into a stable period, can be more regular to and from work. My old job was in the latter category.

Before the company is too leisurely, the work is quite relaxed, the feeling does not have the development prospect, also can not learn the thing. Our project manager stayed there for years to get that job. Sign a five-year contract, you can rock the car in Beijing, buy a house, but I do not want to live in that kind of life, left the office.

It was supposed to be a different company. There was some delay and I didn't look for a job for months. A while back, a well-connected guy on the Internet asked me if I wanted to come to Yangzhou. I am a very Buddhist, have been to many cities, we care about food, climate are indifferent, so in which city life does not matter. I didn't feel so good in Beijing. I was told I could change my environment. I thought I'd give it a try and come to Yangzhou.

Before, I thought Yangzhou was a second-tier city. There'd be jobs. When I got there, I realized there weren't that many positions available. The programmer job I was looking for, for example, wasn't that easy to find, and there wasn't much demand for it. The average wage in Yangzhou is no better, with basic jobs such as security guard and car wash workers earning as little as $3,000 to $4,000 a month.

Came here and rented an apartment. Do Not know the market at first, is in accordance with Beijing's heart rate rent. In fact, I found that the rent is too expensive, there is no way out. I can't go anywhere on New Year's Day. I'm staying in my apartment. I order takeout every day because I'm not a good cook.

I was going to look for a job years from now, but then I got caught up in this epidemic. The more companies did not hire during the outbreak, the less options were available. The apartment pays rent every month, so the plans don't really keep up. Anyway, at the end of the day, I think delivery is a good choice. When the rider threshold is low, although tired, compared to other jobs or higher wages.

Affected by the epidemic, recent orders are not particularly large. I usually don't have any orders in the morning. I don't go out until 9:00 or 10:00. I'm busy at lunch, and then I'm free again at 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon. After that, there weren't any orders. I'd be back by 8:00 or 9:00, so special times can be a buffer for a Newbie like me.

I used to order takeout all the time. In the most extreme case, I ordered a meal that took an hour longer to arrive. My friend was very angry when the rider explained that he had fallen, but I felt all right. Another time, I was so hungry that I had to order again. The first order didn't arrive until the meal was finished. The basic requirement for a customer to order food is to have it delivered in one piece and relatively quickly.

When I made my own delivery, I realized I was running out of time. We're a little short-handed, so we've had a few problems with the system lately. They're short-staffed and slow. There's a mall in the area we sent over, and they won't let riders in, so there's a list they need to drop off. Shops may be only one person, sometimes a lot of single together to do down.

I delivered one the other day, and by the time I got it, it was three minutes over. Plus, sometimes the navigation's a little off. Because of the outbreak, some of the roads are blocked, so it's GonNa be a little bit of a detour. All of this can lead to timeouts. However, during the outbreak, the community is not allowed to enter, things are put directly at the door, which has helped me save some time.

Maybe everyone from the rider to the customer has to make allowance for each other. The soup spilled two days ago, objectively speaking, the responsibility is not really me, the business lunch box is thin, all broken, the soup spilled, not shake out. That order is pickled cabbage fish, should be 48 yuan, I told the customer add wechat to compensate him.

$48. I said I'd pay for it. Didn't change the thought that someone like me, who makes five bucks a job, shouldn't think that way. But the customer went home and dealt with it, and told me it was free. They're actually pretty nice.

All the customers I've met so far have been kind of Nice. I made all the usual mistakes that novices face, such as running over time, spilling a meal or taking the wrong one. But the customer is quite considerate, perhaps this and I admit fault attitude is good also related, know wrong I admit fault.

Whether it's running outside in front of a computer or on an electric bike, it's work for me. Some of the older riders, almost all year round, and I'm only a month into it and I'm not particularly tired. I used to sit in the office every day, look at my computer, get off work on time, and have a Saturday weekend off, but of course the riders were more tired than me. But there is a good saying, "fear of fatigue when what riders, " to do riders is not because here pay proportional to income, as long as hard work, wages will be good.

I've been paying rent in Yangzhou for six months, just to see how things are, and to get used to the job and the city. I don't know what I'm GonNa do with my life. I've been writing code for a couple of months, and I'm not sure I'm going to be able to find a job in this situation. Of course, it's possible to become a good rider, get paid well, and stay in the business forever.

##Jia Pengfei, massage technician born after 1980, Baoji, Shaanxi

##If I hadn't changed my profession then, I would be a nurse in Wuhan now

On February 3rd, the 14th of the first month, my first day as a rider of Meituan, I delivered a total of seven orders.

The first order was a bowl of rice noodles. The customer was a woman in her 30s. The weather was fine and windy, the roads were deserted, shops were mostly closed and the streets were empty. She lives in a community of factory dormitories. She ran out of the building. I handed her a plastic bag of rice noodles through the door. She said thank you and turned away.

If it had not been for this outbreak, this would have been the day I returned to Shanghai. I'm a physical therapist at a massage parlor in Qingpu District. I have lived in Shanghai for 4 years and like the humid climate, civilization and refinement of the city. One detail that struck me was that in Shanghai, you can't just hand-feed people, you have to hand-feed them on a plate or on a tongs.

This year, I've been in the massage business for 11 years. The massage shop in Shanghai offers room and board, works 12 hours a day, works hard, gets a monthly salary of 8,000 yuan ~ 10,000 yuan. In Baoji, that's a lot of money. I had planned to stay in Shanghai and make some money for a few years, but the epidemic changed everything.

On January 20, I returned to Baoji from Shanghai for the Lunar New Year. Massage Parlors in Shanghai close as outbreak plummets. On the first day of the first lunar month, I discussed privately with my colleagues that the time for resuming work might be extended or even need to make other plans. The entire massage shop has a total of more than 40 employees, accommodation is no small expense. The boss doesn't say when to reopen, we don't ask questions, and everyone knows it.

After the seventh day of the first lunar month, there are seven or eight colleagues back to Shanghai, no wages so far, the boss only bear catering, but no longer bear the cost of accommodation. There are seven or eight people like me who work on the spot.

I had a family and I couldn't afford to be idle all the time, so I decided to stay in Baoji and become a Dolce & Gabbana rider. One of my childhood friends has been a horseman for nearly six months. We hadn't been in touch for a long time, he told me during a Spring Festival Chitchat. In Baoji, Meituan riders make good money, so he decided to give it a try.

I was born, raised and married in Baoji, a small Guanzhong city with a population smaller than a fraction of Shanghai's. The first day of the first lunar month, Shaanxi Province launched a public health emergency response. The panic spread to the small town where he grew up. Shops are closing, citizens are closing their doors, and take-out bikers are becoming the city's most wanted.

We all know what's at stake out there in the wild. But if we young and strong don't come out, who can we expect to come out? So, January 30, I through a friend, to see the current webmaster, the next day will receive a uniform. He's a rider on this site, too. We're colleagues now.

On my first day, at ten o'clock in the morning, the station master arranged for an old rider to accompany me with the delivery. He looked on and gave me instructions on how to take orders, pick up food and deliver food on my mobile phone. Typically, it takes 30 minutes from the rider to complete the delivery, which includes the restaurant's production time.

A little after two in the afternoon, I began to deliver food by myself. Because of the epidemic, our area, the only open shop is a beef noodle restaurant, a rice noodle restaurant, there are several supermarkets and pharmacies. Like any other city, the busiest place in Baoji is a hospital. In the small town of Guanzhong, fear is also spreading. The city suddenly empty, the citizens closed at home, quiet let me strange.

Because of the epidemic, I often think of my days as a nurse recently. I graduated from nursing and worked as a respiratory nurse before becoming a masseuse. After the Spring Festival, six former schoolmates have already gone to Wuhan one after another. In the news, I saw the medical care dinner to eat instant noodles, indescribable sad. If I didn't change careers then, I don't know if I'm in Wuhan now.

During the outbreak of SARS in 2003, I happened to be interning at a top three hospital in Jilin City, Jilin Province. Several of my classmates and I were transferred to the hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases support, responsible for the care and isolation of fever patients. At that time, the protection conditions are far better than today, no N95, protective clothing, goggles, only 48 layers of gauze mask. Every three hours, we need to change masks, wash them in hot water, disinfect them and dry them. Our gauze masks were hanging on the clothesline, white as a sheet. I was 19 years old, Youth, and had no idea what fear was, and several young nurses were still playing games with feverish patients in the ward.

Fortunately, there is not a single case of SARS in Jilin City, and we are all safe. However, the head nurse of that hospital went to Beijing Ditan Hospital to support. At that time, the hospital was called "SARS hospital" , admitted a large number of patients, medical infection rate is very high.

It was summer by the time she returned to the northeast. I've forgotten a lot of things, but I remember clearly, she said, in Beijing, when you stick a needle into a patient, you need to wear three layers of plastic gloves and a thick protective suit. "A good nurse needs to be able to feel as if she could find a vein and push a needle through even three layers of gloves, " she says.

Someone had to do something. She did what she had to do.

After graduation, my classmates and friends went to hospitals all over the country. I was young, I had a lot of desire, I had a lot of ideas. The nurse's salary is too low to satisfy me. After a short period of six months of medical work, I chose to leave Jilin and go to Xi'an to make a living. As I found out later, almost all the men who graduated that year switched careers.

In four or five years, I have held numerous jobs, including construction workers, eyeglass-grinding workers and so on. It wasn't until 2009 that I returned to nursing and became a masseuse. In the winter of 2015, in order to better development, I began to drift. Before I left Shaanxi, I got married. Shanghai's high housing prices made it impractical to settle down, so her wife stayed in Baoji.

Because of the epidemic, I re-examined my career choice and said no regrets was a lie. Life is not only short-term interests, as well as professional value, dignity and so on, could not understand, now understand is already middle-aged. If I had it to do over again, now that I've studied nursing, I'd go a lot further.

I admire those "retrograde" to Wuhan Students, this courage, not everyone has. One of the girls stayed in the ICU. A few days ago, she told us in a wechat account of the first-line Experience: a Ward, five nurses care for eight patients, one night, she changed 13 tanks of oxygen. A few days ago, she just menstrual period, because protective clothing precious, need to minimize wear off, a day of work, pants are wet.

My four-year-old is my Achilles heel. If I could earn a decent income as a rider and stay in Baoji to take care of my family, I would also consider a long-term career. More than 20 days passed, although there are grievances, there are unpleasant, but also harvest. My expected income is between 5,000 and 8,000. Now, enterprises have an orderly resumption of work, the road sometimes will be stuck in traffic, rush-hour orders began to more. I hope it gets better.

##Gao Peng, post 90s entrepreneur, Kunming

##My wife is four months pregnant. I want to make more money

Without the outbreak, I'd probably still be a take-out rider.

I was born in Kunming in 1992 and moved to Guangzhou and Shanghai before returning to Kunming a few years ago. When I got married last December, my wife was already pregnant. She was working at a nail salon, and she quit when she got married because of a pregnancy scare. When the days of eating alone and not being hungry were over, I suddenly realized my responsibilities as a husband and father.

Four years ago, my family and my cousin's family invested $500,000 to open a car wash. My brother and I are part of the operation, both as a boss and a worker. The car wash is now on the right track and the principal invested is almost back. In accordance with the agreement, in addition to the year-end bonus, my brother and I took turns to work at the car wash, receive a salary, 3000 yuan per month.

The baby's coming, and for me, it's not enough.

At the beginning of January, I began to look for a job in 58 different cities. Because I've been a driver and I own a car wash, my priority is getting a ride. But in Kunming, the water is deep. I saw some posts on the Internet, some people were black intermediary pit swindles, paid thousands of dollars did not drive on. So I started thinking about the job as a delivery rider, which is relatively free, flexible and not too high a bar.

After an interview, on January 20, I officially became a rider of Meituan. Say also coincidentally, the site in my house next door building, work, communication is very convenient. By then, my wife had gone back to her family, and I was living alone. Near the Spring Festival, Kunming is still busy, take-away orders a lot, busy time I can send 36 orders a day, up to a month can have 6000 yuan ~ 7000 yuan income.

Only three days later, however, the situation in Wuhan worsened and the atmosphere in Kunming became tense. The car wash is closed. No one leaves the house. On the first day of the first lunar month, I often delivered food to the community, there was a confirmed case.

I've only been on the job a few days, and this is totally unexpected. When my wife heard about it, she called me immediately. "stop running and go home, " she said anxiously.

I've thought about it, too. Forget about the pay. quit and go home. I didn't know if I was safe. What if I went home and infected her? Besides, this is the first official job four or five years after starting a business, and it's irresponsible to run away from it. On three, I decided not to go home and keep delivering.

The Spring Festival was originally the peak season for tourism in Yunnan Province. Because of the epidemic situation, the tourism market slipped into the freezing point. Fewer people, tourist attractions closed, the public is closed, take-away orders significantly reduced. Only a few restaurants, fruit shops and drug stores remain open in the city. This winter, the weather in Kunming is colder than usual, and it snowed on the first day of the first lunar month.

My wife calls me every day, asking about my health and taking precautions. She holds a cell phone every day waiting for my message, I sent her Wechat, she is always "seconds back. ". She's four months pregnant, and she's having a really bad reaction to the pregnancy, and I feel so guilty for worrying about it.

I've also sent hospital orders for fruit, meals, and so on, some to doctors, some to The Adventure of the Resident Patient. During the Spring Festival, Meituan is no contact with the distribution, so I do not have special fear. Besides, when disaster does come, fear is useless. But I never tell my parents or my wife that I deliver food to the hospital.

The impact of the outbreak on the car wash quickly became apparent. Usually, we open on the sixth day of the first lunar month. Around the eighth day is the best business days, a day to wash more than 70 cars, sometimes even too busy to eat breakfast. This year, the opening was delayed again and again until Feb. 26 because of the epidemic. And, even when it was open, business was unusually quiet.

Our car wash has 200 square meters, a year's rent is 120,000, closed for a day is not a small loss. Now that I think about it, I made the right choice coming out here as a rider, and it took a lot off my shoulders.

I did not go to university, 18-year-old out of work, in a chemical plant as a worker, salary 2400 yuan per month, factory food and shelter. After I quit the factory, I worked as a worker on the construction site my uncle contracted, as a driver with my driver's license, and as a worker in Shanghai and Guangzhou. Time flies, flash has been ten years. It remains to be seen when business at the car wash will return to normal. But I remain optimistic that the epidemic will pass.

Now, Kunming has begun to resume work in an orderly manner, take-out orders gradually increased, I can send more than 30 orders every day. Spring warm weather, the wind and Sunny, on the road does not feel hard.

On New Year's Eve, my wife and I had a quarrel over some trifles. "You don't want to come back to this house and never come back, " she said angrily over the phone. I had a bad temper and was angry and didn't come home that day. On the first day of the first lunar month, the food delivery community found a confirmed case, I can not go back. And for that, I have been filled with guilt. When the outbreak is over, I want to make it up to her.

Car Wash is my business, and if it's going well, I'd like to open a branch in the future. As for the Jockey Job, I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it, but I'll do my job every single day.

Gao Weimo, hairdresser after 1995, Nanjing

Save up for special occasions, support small dreams

I was born in'98. I've been delivering food in Nanjing for almost a month. My hometown is Fengyang County, Fengyang County is very close to Nanjing, more than two hours drive, there are a lot of people in my hometown work in Nanjing.

In the summer of 2018, after graduating from high school, I didn't get into a good school and didn't want to repeat my studies, so I came to Nanjing. Fengyang County's a small town, but after graduation, I thought I'd try it out. My parents also work in Nanjing, my father in the chemical plant, my mother in the Electronics Factory. They also wanted to take me to the factory, I think in the factory too boring, or want to learn a trade.

I saw a barber shop to recruit apprentices, think this industry "pretty cool" , want to learn hairdressing, the future can own a shop.

Learned more than a year, is now an apprentice, feeling that this industry cycle is a bit long, generally three or four years to learn, a bit shaken. Before more than a year, each month can only earn more than a thousand, living or need some family subsidies.

Before the Spring Festival I saw the news on the Internet, said Wuhan there pneumonia, did not feel very serious, I went home on January 19 the New Year. After the New Year, I returned to Nanjing on the 27th, when the bus was still open, and then the village road was closed.

On the way to Nanjing, I felt the epidemic was getting worse. Get on and get off the car to check the body temperature, in the Jiangsu-anhui junction of the place also checked once, when entering Nanjing, also scan Qr Code Registration. After arriving, and in the home isolation for 14 days, after getting a certificate issued by the Neighborhood Committee to go out.

I knew when I got here that the barbershop wasn't open, and I had to give notice when it was.

But I don't think I can sit around. In the home quarantine, I began to look for work on the Internet, in 58 with the city to see the United States group in the recruitment of riders, signed up. After the interview, they assigned me to a station on Nangang's side.

At first it was training. I ran with the master for two days to familiarize myself with the whole food delivery process. Special period, before Mount Guard still did safety training, basically speak epidemic situation and traffic safety. Meituan gave us masks to change every four hours at work, disposable gloves, alcohol, and hand sanitizer.

Every morning, the site will give the rider unified disinfection, each time to send a single and back to the site, and again to disinfection. The mask stays on at all times. You can't go to the mall to pick up food without a mask, or you might look like a monster. Each rider is also equipped with a safety card, to record the daily temperature, disinfection, and then take photos and upload.

The outbreak is serious, Meituan launched a "no contact distribution. ". In the business after the meal, is generally delivered to the designated area at the door, and then inform the customer down to take. Most of the neighborhoods are now inaccessible, so they have to be delivered to the door.

I've had customers who were difficult to talk to, who insisted I take them upstairs, who didn't believe my explanation, and who said they wanted to complain about me. I stood at the gate of the community said for a long time, and finally there is no way, security sent him over. It's a pain in the neck to have to deal with such a difficult customer.

Most of the customers are fine. Someone will tell you to put your food in the right place, take a picture, and you won't have to wait. And the customers would say, "well, it's been hard for you guys to deliver food, and I think that's very sweet. ".

Once a customer ordered soup buns and noodles. I thought I'd deliver them quickly. The noodles wouldn't taste good once they were dry. After they arrived, he gave me a reward of $8.80. I don't care about the money, but the customers give me good reviews. Another time, I sent a single to the SWAT team, the order of the sister wrote on the remarks: The husband remember to pay attention to protection, and then busy also have a good rest, eat on time. I find all of this heartwarming.

There are two hospitals around our station, one is Nangang Hospital, the other is Zhongda Hospital. I have been there many times. Before nervous, Nangang Hospital from a distance from the gate there is a temperature measurement point, but also to register identity card number, food delivery should be placed in the food, can not go upstairs. You can send it upstairs in the next two days.

These two hospitals are not designated hospitals, now very few people. I don't feel nervous either. I just need to be protected. There's no need to stress myself out.

Most of the orders at the hospital are from the paramedics. I sent to the hospital, a nurse sister ordered a few fried rice, she told me, now the epidemic is serious, you out of food delivery is not easy, also gave me a bottle of yogurt, my heart is very warm. I didn't have anything else, I had to bring them food, and it wasn't easy for them, and I thought to myself, let's get it over to them so they can have a hot meal.

After the beauty industry, a month in Nanjing can get a few thousand, but the competition is still fierce, also very hard. It's open at 9:00 every morning, and if anyone comes in for a perm at night, it'll have to wait until it's done.

I didn't think much of it when I was looking for a job as a rider, and I figured as long as the protection was good, I should be okay. Because the delivery guy was always at work, and I wasn't alone, and the street sweeper was working. The shops on the street have been slowly opening for the past two days.

I used to think it wasn't easy for the takeout industry to run around every day. Now I work eight or nine hours a day, three shifts in the morning, noon and night, and can choose to take a day off each week. I am a novice, every day to send 30 or 40 single bar, calculate, plus bonuses and subsidies and so on, should be able to get four or five thousand dollars.

I am an only child, parents were very worried at first, they said the delivery contact people, I explained to them, will do their own protection, the site will also give us disinfection. They haven't even started their factories yet. They're back home.

I figured I'd stick around for a while after the epidemic, deliver the food, save some money for myself. After that, I still want to learn a trade, see if there is any good industry. Many of my family members open restaurants here, and other industries to work, I may also consider learning to cook something.

People have a little dream, I still want to have some savings, to support their little dream.
