Jingjing is one of several people who have come to me for help. In the most helpless days, she was suddenly remembered by me, is she firmly said on the phone, "I have lost grandma, I can not lose dad. "

The day before, her grandmother, who had brought her to the hospital since she was a child, died 10 hours later, without waiting for a nucleic acid test. In the initial call, she couldn't hear her grief over losing her grandmother, but it was clear that she was determined to get her father, who was already symptomatic, to take a nucleic acid test.

I kept in touch with her, my father's nucleic acid test came back, went to the quarantine site, has been admitted to the hospital, transferred to the Golden Pool, stable condition... 12 days after receiving her first call for help, we have this long talk. At this point, she's isolated at home. I thought I knew most of her story, but by the time I heard it, there was so much I didn't know.

January 23: Never Mind

Hello everyone, I am Jing Jing, a native of Wuhan, this year 37 years old, working in the bank.

On January 10th, I received a message on my friend's Wechat group saying, don't go to a public place, don't go to a crowded place, there might be SARS.

I didn't even think about it. I didn't even think about it. It's still normal. Going to the mall on weekends, going to the movies, going to dinner, living a normal life, not caring; not caring much, even if the medical staff in my circle of friends were already talking about it.

On January 22, the day before the city was sealed off, I was working in my office. Officials have raised the possibility of human-to-human transmission, and say that Wuhan's citizens go wherever they go and do whatever they do.

Leaders began to attach importance to this issue, let us quickly buy some masks, alcohol back, but also think about how to maintain the following class, do not mess.

We've been on leave since the 23rd, so the 23rd is actually on leave. On the night of the 22nd, I went back to my home in Hankou, where my grandmother, my father and my mother lived. My Grandmother is 83, my father is 64,65, and my mother is 60.

I took grandma out for a walk around the store, the supermarket, to buy what she liked to eat. Thinking about the coming New Year, I bought some beetroot fruits, pistachios, and Longan, sugar oranges and so on. My grandmother is usually very attention to exercise, I think she is still relatively strong, walking, appetite is very normal, appetite is very good.

By the 23rd, the bus was out of service, and we were still trying to figure out how to get to work? Should I send a driver inside or something. I was still thinking about it.

Because our home is in Hankou, from the city six hospitals, Long Airlines Hospital, Children's Hospital is very close. I was thinking, all these people with fever are going to the hospital, and I'm worried about my grandma. On repeated instructions, call mom and dad and grandma every day, told them not to go out, contact them every day. They were fine, even grandma. Grandma had a slight cough, but she usually coughed, too, so we didn't pay attention, and we never did.

On the 22nd, when I bought medicine and mask at work, I also bought one for my family. What vitamin C, Lotus purgative ah... is on the market that can prevent those drugs. I sent it back the night of the 22nd. After the "closed city" , I told them every day, "do not go out" , "I bought those preventive medicine you have to eat AH, " every day to call them. And they really, really didn't leave the house.

January 31: Grandma has a fever

On the fourth day of the first lunar month, I called my grandmother. She was Gasp. I said, what's wrong with you? Why can't you breathe?

I remember very well that day when the sun came out, grandma went out. She was walking up the stairs when I got back. I called her. "I don't want to eat, " she said. "I just want to go down and get two packets of instant noodles. "

In fact, when I think back, it was the 28th, she might have lost her appetite, but we didn't care.

I called her again after a while, and she got better. She had asthma herself, she said. Maybe she had a little asthma attack, and now she was breathing badly and had no appetite. She thought it was because she didn't want to eat noodles at home and ran down to buy instant noodles. But instant noodles bought back do not want to eat, "not delicious. ".

And I was like, "well, you get some rest, and you can tell my dad what you want for dinner, and he'll make it for you. ".

I always take a break up front. I have to go to work on the fifth day. The unit sent a car to pick up, I let the driver master at my door for a while, in the roadside to dad and sent a little medicine, a little mask. I didn't see my grandma that day, and my dad was fine. I said that you should take care of yourselves at home, go out and buy more food at a time, throw away the mask as soon as you use it, don't leave it at home, I also told him.

The result of the fifth day to call, my father has taken grandma to the community hospital, we know an old doctor opened a private clinic, give her an anti-inflammatory injection. When I told him to watch out, he said, don't talk nonsense, which means don't let grandma think she might have it. And he got impatient and yelled at me. We people in Wuhan have a rather violent temper, I dare not say, that you accompany grandma every day injection, you two people have to put on a mask, he said, "know. ".

28th, 29th, 30th, but by the 31st, my grandmother had a fever.

I was facetiming with my dad that afternoon, and he was at the Changhang Hospital. I said, what's wrong? He said your grandmother's in the hospital shooting.

By the time the scans came back, both lungs were infected, and it was pretty bad. The hospital said that in this case they could not give her injections, but only gave her some medicine and asked us to find a way to stay in the hospital as soon as possible.

My fourth aunt in the Second Hospital of Wuhan Steel, we first contact her, the grandmother's film to Her, she showed them to the director of infectious disease. See directly after the diagnosis, said grandma this situation is already very serious, to find a way to get her to their hospital as soon as possible, this is the 31st said.

Then, on February 1, my aunt called my aunt again, saying she couldn't get through, that my grandmother hadn't had her nucleic acid tested yet, and that she had to test positive for nucleic acid before she could be taken to their hospital.

Since I was at work, my aunt went everywhere and alerted the community to what the nucleic acid test was all about. The Community said to go to Concord, only Tongji, concord side to do. My Aunt Ran, but nothing came of it. There was no bike. She rode a bike. My Aunt's forty-six.

She thought it was because she didn't want to eat noodles at home and ran down to buy instant noodles. But instant noodles bought back do not want to eat, "not delicious. ".

And I was like, "well, you get some rest, and you can tell my dad what you want for dinner, and he'll make it for you. ".

I always take a break up front. I have to go to work on the fifth day. The unit sent a car to pick up, I let the driver master at my door for a while, in the roadside to dad and sent a little medicine, a little mask. I didn't see my grandma that day, and my dad was fine. I said that you should take care of yourselves at home, go out and buy more food at a time, throw away the mask as soon as you use it, don't leave it at home, I also told him.

The result of the fifth day to call, my father has taken grandma to the community hospital, we know an old doctor opened a private clinic, give her an anti-inflammatory injection. When I told him to watch out, he said, don't talk nonsense, which means don't let grandma think she might have it. And he got impatient and yelled at me. We people in Wuhan have a rather violent temper, I dare not say, that you accompany grandma every day injection, you two people have to put on a mask, he said, "know. ".

28th, 29th, 30th, but by the 31st, my grandmother had a fever.

I was facetiming with my dad that afternoon, and he was at the Changhang Hospital. I said, what's wrong? He said your grandmother's in the hospital shooting.

By the time the scans came back, both lungs were infected, and it was pretty bad. The hospital said that in this case they could not give her injections, but only gave her some medicine and asked us to find a way to stay in the hospital as soon as possible.

My fourth aunt in the Second Hospital of Wuhan Steel, we first contact her, the grandmother's film to Her, she showed them to the director of infectious disease. See directly after the diagnosis, said grandma this situation is already very serious, to find a way to get her to their hospital as soon as possible, this is the 31st said.

Then, on February 1, my aunt called my aunt again, saying she couldn't get through, that my grandmother hadn't had her nucleic acid tested yet, and that she had to test positive for nucleic acid before she could be taken to their hospital.

Since I was at work, my aunt went everywhere and alerted the community to what the nucleic acid test was all about. The Community said to go to Concord, only Tongji, concord side to do. My Aunt Ran, but nothing came of it. There was no bike. She rode a bike. My Aunt's forty-six.

Feb. 3: I haven't had a chance to grieve

I asked my aunt, I said I can now go buy medicine, can give grandma some of that Gamma Globulin or something. And then my aunt, she said, "you don't have to buy it, you don't have to call it, it's no use. ". When I said it didn't work, she told me the truth.

She said on the phone, your grandmother is 83 years old, and this film, their director looked, flower lung, which means it is very serious, very serious, there is no cure.

I listened at that time, because too suddenly, can not accept, I cry inside the unit. And everybody at work knows about it, so just get me home. One is also worried about my body, two are also worried that I have had contact with them Ah, they are also worried that I have been infected? Right?

February 2nd. I'm still trying to figure out if I can get an oxygenator? They're asking people where they sell oxygen. By 8 o'clock in the evening, my grandmother was already breathing very unsmoothly, very difficult. In fact, I (that is, aunt) on the 2nd day also begged their hospital leadership, but the hospital was also taken over, there is no right to arrange for patients to be hospitalized immediately. It wasn't until 11 pm that a 120 ambulance was called to Hankou and my grandmother was taken to the second Wugang Hospital in Baiyushan, Qingshan District, Wuhan, a long drive of more than an hour.

At 1:00 am on the 3rd, my aunt and my father were in the ambulance and took my grandmother to Wugang No. 2 Hospital, where she died at 2:03 pm just over 10 hours later.

My aunt wasn't on line one, and she couldn't get into the ward. She's been asking around, too, and the last time I heard from her, it was 2:30, and she said that my grandmother had passed away at 2:03.

I was in my own house in Wuchang, and I couldn't grieve. The first thing that came to my mind was that, although grandma didn't even have a nucleic acid test at the end, that was the disease on her film. I worry about me, my father, my mother and my aunt, all four of whom are in close contact with my grandmother. I arrived in Hankou just after 3:00 p.m. , went to the Changhang hospital with my mom and dad, waited in line for blood tests and x rays.

Early on the morning of February 4th, my dad went to the hospital to get the results and told me that my mom and I were fine. He's not okay. He's got inflammation. He's got inflammation in his lungs.

He sent the scans to my aunt, and then he went to the chief of surgery, and when she was done, he told me, "Your Dad's been diagnosed, too, and that's what's wrong, so you need to get your dad in the hospital.

I said, "If you can get my grandmother into your hospital, you can get my father into your hospital. ". She said it wasn't going to work, that she had pulled all the strings for her last visit, all the strings she could pull, and that it had been a long meeting, but there was nothing I could do about your father. She said you have to figure it out, you have to figure it out as soon as possible, and your father is one of those people who has a primary disease, which is a disease that people with a primary disease develop very quickly.

I asked my aunt, I said I can now go buy medicine, can give grandma some of that Gamma Globulin or something. And then my aunt, she said, "you don't have to buy it, you don't have to call it, it's no use. ". When I said it didn't work, she told me the truth.

February 4: All of today's test strips are gone

My father had a history of diabetes for more than a decade, and in 2016 he had a severe case of high blood pressure, stage III, and a little coronary heart disease. As soon as I heard that, I started to panic. I didn't know what to do.

Because of grandma's experience before, insisted on the nucleic acid test, I knew only concord, Tongji. But these two hospitals are very crowded, I had to find a leader on the Internet, friends to help me ask if there are resources, at least tell me where fewer people, I want to take my father as soon as possible to do nucleic acid testing. The result asked to Wuchang District seven hospitals.

Within an hour, I was at seven hospital, the first hospital I'd ever been to. And then after the clinic, the doctor asked for our home address. He said Your Dad's from Hankou, you can't treat him across districts. You're going to a hospital in Hankou. I mean, can't we even take a test? He said no, no, no. They have rules now.

I don't know what to do. I got ta get to Hankou. I posted a friend circle on the way, asking for help. Because I was really at a loss, and I didn't even know where to go for the fastest nucleic acid test. And the lung hospital only takes patients who were there when they first came in. Then a lot of people told me that a hospital could do a nucleic acid test.

An Arrow at the door of a hospital pointed me to another place: The fever clinic. It's probably a few hundred meters from the hospital, a small, isolated compound. When I got there, I saw two long lines, one on the left, one on the right. I was GONNA ask a paramedic, but there was no one there, just patients. Paramedics could be in that room.

I was too embarrassed to jump the queue to ask, so I asked the friend in my circle who told me to go to this hospital. She stood in line with her mother-in-law the day before yesterday and told me how to do this: First Take my father's film to a clinic. There are two paramedics at that door. One to check in, one to Holler. He said, "your number is very far back, it may have to wait until evening, the first 147 people, it may have to wait until evening, can you wait? "?

I said I have no way, can not wait is not to have to wait, I said, "wait" .

There were a lot of people waiting in line, many of them with little stools. The line stretched all the way to the sidewalk outside the yard. Everyone was waiting anxiously. I had no choice but to wait there. Some patients are directly in the platoon, there are some families like me to help patients platoon, have.

While standing in line, people kept telling me, telling me to look for reporters, and so on, and I kept sending them some requests for help, AH, kept calling, and my cell phone died. I ran to a today supermarket near the hospital to recharge my batteries.

Until more than seven o'clock in the evening, I lined up to the th, opened the nucleic acid test list, I quickly ran to the right side of the line, and saw that there were fewer people. After half an hour, the staff came out and told us, don't wait, today is done, today's test paper is gone, you'd better go home, come early tomorrow.

February 7: I signed myself up

We were wondering if we could get this number in front of us? He said No. He wants to come in early tomorrow to get his number. So I got there at half past five the next morning. Because the day before I had opened the nucleic acid test check list, so I directly in the nucleic acid test line. At that time, there were very few people, three or three or two people, I counted, I was the sixth.

I asked them the night before, and they said they'd start at half past eight, and I thought it must be before half past eight, the sooner the better.

5:30. It's still dark, just like at night, and it's cold. I remember it well. It was cold. I waited there until nine o'clock. My husband drove and picked up my dad at 8:00.

I actually heard it while I was waiting in line. Someone said it was the third time. The first two tests were negative, but he still had the symptoms, so he had to do it again. I thought, well, my dad isn't sure about this either, next time I'll get the results on the 7th in 48 hours, I'll still have to be there at that time (because there will be fewer people there) , but I'll have to send him to another clinic, and I'll have to do it again as I get the results.

I dropped my dad off on the 5th after the shoot, so I went down the street by myself. She gave a general account of the situation, saying that my father had a very serious underlying disease, and that someone in the family had been diagnosed, and indeed it was this disease that killed him. My father had close contact with her, and the CT scans also showed bilateral lung infections, that is, this disease, ask them if they can help me get my dad in the hospital.

At that time the staff said that their community who has been two nucleic acid tests are positive, so far there is no way, still inside the house isolation. I told you it was a bad idea. My grandmother died because of it, and now I can't even grieve.

I cry when I think of my grandma, but I can't rub my eyes when I cry in the hospital, so I can't think of her. I just wanted to focus all my energy on helping my dad get to the hospital as soon as possible, so I was really excited.

Later, uh, director Deng said, I can understand your filial piety, but, uh, now there are too many people asking to be hospitalized, and there are many people crying in my place every day.

On the 6th, I was at home all day, and I just kept calling around, reporting things, "four groups of people" and stuff like that. And then on the morning of the 7th, I went to get the results, and I registered two more numbers, and I registered one for myself, and one for my dad. Because I also doubt whether I have a problem, thirty, the beginning of the first symptoms of chest tightness cough, but did not think that way.

We were wondering if we could get this number in front of us? He said No. He wants to come in early tomorrow to get his number. So I got there at half past five the next morning. Because the day before I had opened the nucleic acid test check list, so I directly in the nucleic acid test line.

February 8: Mom just writes the will

When the doctor saw my scans, he said you were fine, so he didn't give me a nucleic acid test, just my dad. He gave me some more medicine. He said you should take it at home first. If the medicine can stop it, it will prove that it is OK. If you take it for a few days and see if it is still wrong, then you can take an X-ray.

Dad's test came back positive, so I ran another nucleic acid test. Then immediately go to the community line, directly to the doctor's diagnosis to them, the doctor advised to go to a designated hospital immediately. The Community Worker said to put your dad in the front row, and to move your dad in as soon as a bed was available.

On the 6th, the news on the Internet has said that many shelter hospitals have been built, but in fact the community has not started to send patients. People in the community say, "not if your dad goes to a shelter hospital, which is for people under 65, who have no underlying disease, who can move on their own. ". Had to put him in the hospital.

I called around again, one by one, to report back to them on my father's condition. My father has not yet been effectively quarantined, and he still lives in the same room with my mother, and can only be quarantined by a mask. I put this very seriously, i hope they can solve it as soon as possible, and they all are, "report your case as soon as possible, report your case as soon as possible, " and these are the results.

On the 7th, my mom freaked out, and she always calls me with a growl, a growl. Because first grandma was diagnosed, and then she died, and then my dad was diagnosed, and she was scared, and she was scared. On the 8th, my mother had a complete... mental breakdown. First she called the community, and then she got into an argument on the phone, and it didn't work out.

She just wrote her will. She's at home with my dad, consulting with a friend of hers whose husband is a judge. She was afraid that if something happened to them, it would be very difficult for me to take care of them. She wrote one, and my dad wrote one and gave it to me.

And then she took my dad straight to the street. There's no car. They're on foot. 15 If they're fast, 20 if they're slow. I stopped in the phone is no use, I called the street duty staff, said you here is not an elderly couple at the door, I said that it is my family, XXX sick, you hurry to persuade her to go home.

It turned out that they were not at the place where I had called, but at the duty station in another community, where two elderly people were waiting outside. There was no sun, no wind, and the temperature was low. My mother found a stool for my father to sit, my mother just stood outside the noise, but no one cares about her. They just stood there awkwardly for an hour or two.

I was in a hurry, so I begged my mom, and I said, "you can't fix this. ". I could not go out again, for I myself was at home, and had already begun to have a low-grade fever, and I dared not go out. The street office kept the door shut in the room and would not let them in.

The street called 110, want 110 to take my parents away, take home. And then 110 saw that and turned around and helped my mom and dad. Put pressure on the street. The patient's in this area. There's no quarantine. You have to do something.

February 8: Dad is sent to quarantine and returned

We all understand that the hospital is a bit tight, but you have to at least be able to give my dad a place to go. The street says, "okay, we'll make contact. We'll figure it out. ".

At 4:30 in the afternoon, I got a call from the community, "Now that the connection is made, send a car to your house to pick up your father and meet you half an hour later at the bottom of your building. Take Your father to a quarantined hotel. "

I immediately told my mother the news, my mother said, "I know, I know, we are on our way back. ". They still have to walk. It's nearly 20 minutes. The bus came downstairs at 5:00 and picked up my dad.

Within the group, my mother was still "oops, I can breathe a sigh of relief when your Father Leaves" , only to get another call from my father at 5:30, saying the hotel had no beds, and sent my father back.

I was devastated. How could they do that? I made contact and sent my dad to a hotel to be quarantined, but then I turned around, and 120 guys left, and that's what they did.

So I cried and told my dad, "go upstairs and forget about it for the day. ". I said tomorrow, I'M GONNA get the results of that second nucleic acid test, and I'm going to the street, and I'm not leaving until I get it done.

And then my dad said he wasn't going up, and he said if he went up, in case mom was worried and scared, he'd be downstairs. My mother is also the same idea, said that has come to this point, come up then how about.

My mother at home under a bowl of chicken noodle soup, brought down to my father to eat. My father couldn't eat either, so he ate an egg and continued to sit down. And then I got angry, and I called the number on that street, and I started crying to them, and then they just hung up on me, and when I called back, they didn't pick up.

So I called the mayor's hotline again, and I called the number of the previous two days, and I called them all one by one, and I told them again about the current situation. I said they had people who were seriously ill standing outside, said they were going to the quarantine point, and then they turned around and sent them back. "report it as soon as possible, " the men said.

There was a kind man from the government, he said, we've already reported the matter, it must be able to help your father out, you own the degree. This matter complains to complain to go to, finally must go to the street, go to the community to deal with, must not offend them now.

Maybe they did help me with the paperwork after all. Later that evening, they came to pick up my father again. This time, they took him to a temporary hospital, but there were no medical staff inside, which was equivalent to an isolation point.

February 9: Dad is taken to Golden Pond Hospital

On the morning of the 9th, I went to get the results, and it was negative again. That's when I started to doubt myself. I was thinking, is my dad okay? What about the way we've been acting, the way we've been acting, the way we've been acting? I kind of blame myself.

I went back to my aunt and asked, did you really diagnose this disease from the film? My aunt sent me the exact words of their head of infectious diseases, which means, don't look at the list of nucleic acids, your father has it, and he's going to the hospital. He said that the quarantine wasn't working, and once your dad's condition had progressed, if his sats were below 93% , it was serious.

Didn't dad go to the quarantine on the 8th, and I asked him what his sats were in the morning of the 9th, and he said 96% , and I reported it to my aunt. 98% is normal, 96% is low, but anything below 93% is critical. She said you can't be sloppy, you can't be careless, you got ta keep an eye on the community, you got ta get him admitted to the hospital.

On the night of the 9th, in the early hours of the 10th, they took my father to the hospital, and that was that.

In retrospect, I thought the community workers were great, but if my mom hadn't had a complete mental breakdown and taken my dad for a fight, I don't think my dad would be in the hospital right now. It just feels like the baby's GonNa get fed.

I talk to my dad every day now. He's got it, but it's not that bad. My Aunt also told my dad to ask the doctor if he needed any globulins, and if he did, he told us to go and get some. I also asked, did not give him the ball protein, is to take their medicine inside, slowly pressure blood sugar and blood pressure, control his basic diseases, slowly recover.

He was telling me this morning that his chest was feeling better, and that he was going to have another CT scan, and another nucleic acid scan, and that if there was no problem, I would be discharged, and then I would be in isolation for another 14 days, he told me.

He lives in an extra bed, where he has his blood pressure, blood sugar, and oxygen monitored daily by a paramedic and sent to him by Three Meals a Day.

He doesn't have a fever anymore. Only on the 7th. The day I took his temperature, I found myself in a fever, low fever, the highest temperature of 37 degrees 8, so 8 dare not go out at home.

We all understand that the hospital is a bit tight, but you have to at least be able to give my dad a place to go. The street says, "okay, we'll make contact. We'll figure it out. ".

At 4:30 in the afternoon, I got a call from the community, "Now that the connection is made, send a car to your house to pick up your father and meet you half an hour later at the bottom of your building. Take Your father to a quarantined hotel. "

I immediately told my mother the news, my mother said, "I know, I know, we are on our way back. ". They still have to walk. It's nearly 20 minutes. The bus came downstairs at 5:00 and picked up my dad.

Within the group, my mother was still "oops, I can breathe a sigh of relief when your Father Leaves" , only to get another call from my father at 5:30, saying the hotel had no beds, and sent my father back.

I was devastated. How could they do that? I made contact and sent my dad to a hotel to be quarantined, but then I turned around, and 120 guys left, and that's what they did.

So I cried and told my dad, "go upstairs and forget about it for the day. ". I said tomorrow, I'M GONNA get the results of that second nucleic acid test, and I'm going to the street, and I'm not leaving until I get it done.

And then my dad said he wasn't going up, and he said if he went up, in case mom was worried and scared, he'd be downstairs. My mother is also the same idea, said that has come to this point, come up then how about.

My mother at home under a bowl of chicken noodle soup, brought down to my father to eat. My father couldn't eat either, so he ate an egg and continued to sit down. And then I got angry, and I called the number on that street, and I started crying to them, and then they just hung up on me, and when I called back, they didn't pick up.

So I called the mayor's hotline again, and I called the number of the previous two days, and I called them all one by one, and I told them again about the current situation. I said they had people who were seriously ill standing outside, said they were going to the quarantine point, and then they turned around and sent them back. "report it as soon as possible, " the men said.

There was a kind man from the government, he said, we've already reported the matter, it must be able to help your father out, you own the degree. This matter complains to complain to go to, finally must go to the street, go to the community to deal with, must not offend them now.

Maybe they did help me with the paperwork after all. Later that evening, they came to pick up my father again. This time, they took him to a temporary hospital, but there were no medical staff inside, which was equivalent to an isolation point.

February 9: Dad is taken to Golden Pond Hospital

On the morning of the 9th, I went to get the results, and it was negative again. That's when I started to doubt myself. I was thinking, is my dad okay? What about the way we've been acting, the way we've been acting, the way we've been acting? I kind of blame myself.

I went back to my aunt and asked, did you really diagnose this disease from the film? My aunt sent me the exact words of their head of infectious diseases, which means, don't look at the list of nucleic acids, your father has it, and he's going to the hospital. He said that the quarantine wasn't working, and once your dad's condition had progressed, if his sats were below 93% , it was serious.

Didn't dad go to the quarantine on the 8th, and I asked him what his sats were in the morning of the 9th, and he said 96% , and I reported it to my aunt. 98% is normal, 96% is low, but anything below 93% is critical.

Maybe it's grandma in heaven

At home, I shut myself in my room, afraid to touch my children. My husband lets him sleep in the living room, too. I can't go to the bathroom. We only have one bathroom. But I'M GONNA keep spraying 84 in there. These two days my own symptoms have gone, may be the hospital to give me the drug effect, I just relax a little vigilance. But I still have very little contact with children, and I wear a mask at home.

My mother-in-law puts food in my bowl, and I serve it myself. My bowls were washed and placed separately, and they were not asked to handle them.

My aunt went for a second visit, and it turned out to be bronchitis. She's at home, taking her meds, and then she's staying with us, not at home, in quarantine. You let her stay for at least 14 days, so now it's my mom and my aunt living there. I ask about my mom every day. She's fine for now, no problem.

After my dad went to the hospital, I reached out to people around me, people I know who have been in this situation, and I told them what I did. They both had mild illnesses, and they both went to the shelter hospital, and they both worked it out. It's better now. At least I'm not panicking at home.

You don't know, I used to buy a lot of medicine at home, I can not remember how much money spent, anyway, each time is more than 1,000, each time is more than 1,000. I bought my medicine many, many times. What Lotus clear pestilence, Oseltamivir, this is someone told me, said that if there is a mild infection, take these two drugs combined with eating can be cured. And then said something about vitamin C, I also ran a few pharmacies, as long as there is vitamin C, I bought all of them, because my family is many.

There's a big pharmacy where I work, and they have hard-to-find supplies, but it's limited, one per person at a time. After my grandmother got sick, I tried to get our colleagues to help me, to line up, to buy my medicine. My boss and colleagues are very good, they go to help me line up, help me to buy.

After my dad went to the hospital, I started thinking about grandma, and I cried at home for a few nights. Because I have a great relationship with my grandmother, more than I have with my parents, so to speak. I grew up with my grandmother.

My birthday is January 14th. January 14 this year, I use the lunch break time, the father, mother, grandmother together, eat a Hunan cuisine, because our hometown is in Hunan. That was the last meal I ever took grandma out to.

The last time we saw each other was the night of the 22nd, when I took her out. At that time because I started from the 20th in the chest tightness, I also worried that I was infected, in the unit also wear a mask, go home with grandma is also wearing a mask, afraid that I infected her.

I walked her slowly down the street and took her to the supermarket. I told her, grandma, this situation I can not bring home the fruit (fruit is my son, her great-grandson) , I said, "I buy you some food, you want to eat what you say, you eat more, " I said slowly to her.

I said don't go out, Florida, because my grandma cooks, and she doesn't eat with my mom and dad, so I kept saying, don't make it Yourself, tell my dad what you want to eat, my dad makes it. And she said, "Oh, my food is better than your father's. ". Because she's a very independent Old Lady, and she doesn't want to get anyone in trouble. She is really a very selfless person, she has the ability to do their own time, no trouble to anyone.

On the 2nd, I also said to video-chat with my grandma when she was in good spirits, but things weren't going so well, so I took one look at her. And then I heard she was dead.

Because of this epidemic, what I can't accept most is that my grandmother, a good person, a person who loves us so much, finally left me in this way. I can't stand it. There was no one around. We couldn't even see her one last time. I really can't stand it.

The good news for now is that my dad is stable and moving in the right direction. I thought maybe grandma was watching over him from above.

Later, my aunt also advised me a lot, said grandma old, meaning, perhaps this is a relief to my grandma.

In the last few days, I've seen order begin to set in on our side. By my dad's time, there were a little more hospitals doing nucleic acid tests. After another day or two, what shelter hospital also came out, what this policy and that policy also came out.

I think if my grandma had gotten sick a few days later, maybe we could have saved her.
