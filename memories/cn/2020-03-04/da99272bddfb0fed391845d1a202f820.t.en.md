This morning's diary, in order not to occupy my mother's tracking equipment, early morning passion typing, feeling is more efficient than in the dark at night in the keyboard. During the Spring Festival, I once mentioned a shopkeeper who ran a strawberry garden. During that time, she was very worried. Her family could not sell strawberries. The whole family ate strawberries from morning to night. Now things are getting better. She and her husband are busy sending group purchase orders to neighboring communities every day, 100 Yuan 7 Jin, a basin full, I asked if I could send to the Wuchang District, she is in Jiangxia District, too far away, although for the van to get a pass, but the surrounding orders are not sent, too busy to take care of other areas.

Now strawberries have become a scarce fruit. Most of the fruit in the fruit group are apples, oranges and honeydew melons. Originally, when a large number of strawberries came into the market, the owner of the Strawberry Garden explained to me that because many shop owners around Wuhan had rotten strawberries, the quality was very poor, she introduced strawberry picking in time, can not let the fruit directly rot in the field, otherwise the new fruit will continue to rot, still not grow, several rounds of harvest have been wasted, she ran to the field every day before picking, handling in time, now will not be affected, regular deliveries to the neighborhood.

The community pondered the matter of starting a group to buy vegetables next week, and saw the contents of the set meal sent. It was also cabbage, green pepper, cabbage and Cabbage Moss. The first time I ate cabbage, I was sick of it. After the epidemic ended, I didn't want to touch cabbage and green pepper for a long time, the family has changed the style of stir-fried cabbage: Braised cabbage, braised cabbage, sour and hot cabbage, spicy cabbage with Rice; stir-fried cabbage, shredded cabbage, fried cabbage.., was surprised to eat vegetables every day are ordinary leafy vegetables, in fact, do not reach the standard of green leaves, suddenly feel that eating fried spinach is a luxury.

My name was Daniel Wu, and every time I went to the door to get something, and gave the clerk my name and room number, I had to shout out that I was Daniel Wu. Luckily I was wearing a mask, and my face was so dry that several familiar doormen looked at me and said, hey, daniel Wu's out.

The landlord urged me to pay the second quarter rent, to try to negotiate a reduction, the landlord replied, "I can give you rent-free, then who gives me a free mortgage" , the attitude is relatively strong, I also do not want to continue to struggle with this issue, said the transfer right away. The landlord is actually a very reliable person, before the house things broke, the first time home maintenance, sometimes in the middle of the night unexpected events, such as power cut off, water heater does not give hot water, the stove does not fire, and so on, all immediately reply to me, also shoot video guide me how to check the reason, usually love in friends circle show baby, weekend often with her daughter to climb mountains around.

Pay Treasure to the landlord to transfer the rent and broadband fee (more and more realize the value of the Reserve Relief Fund...) , think about the first half of the year I may only live for more than a month, the rest of the time empty, my heart is like a big mouthful of dry rice, blocked in the throat, "sister, the secondary disaster of the epidemic has spread to my head, the end of the blockade may just be a harder beginning, please work hard to earn money, give the sister redemption, " the friend rolled his eyes, "I also want you to make more money to take me" , she worked in the securities industry, this period of the same trouble, aware that the year-end KPI may not be up to standard, the work of anxiety spent in the kitchen.

If I had known I wouldn't go back for such a long time, at least I would have pulled out the plug ahead of time and cut off the power. Then I would have covered the SOFA and the bed with a dust cover. After Liberation, I would have gone back home and it would have been covered with dust. I would have needed a thorough cleaning. The living room windows were a little drafty. As long as I didn't sweep the floor for a few days, there were always little mosquito corpses under the windowsill, and the cat played with them as toys, pawing them back and forth. At first I thought he ate them, but later I found he was playing with them in his hands, the customers are all over the place (Virgo's Germaphobia happens in strange places) .

The plan is to take advantage of Taobao to do activities, buy an IPAD first aid, and half-dead computer fight too tired, the whole person is not good. Yesterday and call customer service, asked Wuhan after the lifting of the seal can quickly appointment genius bar maintenance, suddenly last week can open, these days and died. Customer Service can not determine the time to change parts, also can not determine the Hubei region staff to work time, explained that can open most of the "Light Return" , "dying struggle. I bought a three-year warranty. During the warranty period, the replacement hardware should be sent back to Shanghai for further disassembly and inspection by the engineers. If I am in a hurry to use it during this period, I can make do with the external display screen. I said I didn't bring my conversion line home, customer service in soft Taiwanese Mandarin replied I'm sorry, there is no other way, I said the shop to buy a new delivery, she said can shoot the goods, can send, I said Ok, I look, and then opened the official website to see the tablet.

Good Pastry, no Taihang Mountains, try soufflé at home, it's not fluffy, it's well organized, she says it's like a honey cake that used to cost a few bucks on the side of the road, I say it's not old-fashioned, it's not a total loss when you The Wrong Mans an old-fashioned, plain cupcake. I, on the other hand, was shunned by the whole family. I guess it was not to my parents'taste. The dishes I cooked were either novel or too Westernized. Every time I saw them eating reluctantly, I continued to eat snacks after dinner, and I was the only one sitting there with my head buried in bitterness, hold on to the empty plate, now they are rushing home to cook, I said nothing I do at home, they said worry that I can not cook, cooking is not good... so think of my taste buds may be really strange, master of dark cuisine, cooking in Xi'an feel very delicious, looking forward to the weekend when the rest at home cooking, cooking at home show is the result of collective disfavor.

Chocolate blogger ate a whole box of unpalatable tea-flavored chocolate, finally opened the new packaging, read the text you know very satisfied, is a five-star praise of a box of chocolate. The brand is Criollo by Antoine Santos, a Frenchman who makes desserts in Japan, the first of its kind to enjoy the silky texture of the original, munching chocolate as it slides off the chair, and the Ganna Sandwich is a very delicate chocolate that you want to chew, beg It to put all the rich in the mouth out. Sweet Sister Amway's Caramel Pudding, soft and tender, Duang Duang, tender as a three-year-old's ass, gills of fish, freshly brewed sedge, steamed tea bowls in Kaiseki, my sister, whom I strongly recommended for a career as a food writer, each of her Amway sentences made me want to fly out of the window to Tokyo for a taste, to see her hair in a big tub of brown sauce, which I thought was melted chocolate syrup, and to burrow my face in, sister, stop right there. This is hot caramel sauce.

I Miss Miss Miss Miss Tony. He's back in Xiaogan. He's fishing every day. I couldn't wait to dye my hair when the epidemic was over, and I hesitated between red, pink, purple, blue, and Gray, all bold colors that my colleagues thought I'd lost my mind when I got back to work. Originally wanted to buy an Amorel hair dye at home to do, see the review said color fast, hand mutilated is easy to dye uneven, I think what if dyed into a Yin and Yang head... or wait for teacher Tony to adjust my color.

In an interview, Zhou Lian recommended books about the epidemic, in addition to the Post Truth era and Paul Blume's getting rid of empathy, to share another way of thinking about empathy. Empathy may not expand our world, but it can place us in a narrower position: 1. Empathy is like a spotlight that allows you to see and care only for a few people in front of you. 2. Empathy is biased and tends to be parochial or nationalistic. 3. Empathy is short-sighted, it allows you to focus on the present, which seems to have many benefits in the present and may have disastrous consequences in the future. 4. Empathy costs more than it costs. It allows people to take care of one person's feelings while ignoring the interests of others. 5. Empathy can corrode relationships, overwhelm people, and undermine their ability to be kind and loving. 6. Empathy leads to violence, and caring for loved ones and kin often leads to war and cruelty to others. In conflict, empathy tends to be the gas pedal rather than the brake, because we empathize with "friends, " "relatives, " not "enemies, " and the author is not calling for a hard-hearted, radical departure from empathy, but a combination of empathy and reason, to achieve mutual understanding.

These days on the Internet, "Chinese Women" , "Chinese men" speech, funny and jokes like, is not some children did not start school, at home classes, suffocated, romance novel see too much, mind is "Fengguanxia Pei, waiting for a good son to ride the white horse married" , I read the ancient romance also do not have these scenes Ah, is it because the former popular abuse, the main male and female toss of the dead to come and go, I abuse in the quilt tears, where there is a white horse rescue dust drama, only the war horse love kill each other, now popular silly white sweet, sweet cookies, do not want money, harm, it is better to see more dog blood abuse, several pot of dog blood poured on the top of the head, will not count on Chinese men this play.

In a screenshot, when asked what to do about domestic violence, the Chinese man replied that it was a family matter, not a "state matter. " He happened to read a report about an increase in domestic violence during pneumonia. Victims of domestic violence were trapped at home, even if they ran out in time, there are no hotel shelters open outside, even a convenience store or fast food restaurant can not hide for a while. If you are injured, it is difficult to find a hospital or clinic that is willing to issue a certificate for dealing with the injury, the police force prioritizes cases related to pneumonia, and is rarely willing to visit people's homes for safety reasons, mostly on the phone and in mud; being locked up at home is stressful, anxious and irritable, with incomes falling and expenses rising, it makes the abuser take out his anger on the victim more frequently, the number of domestic violence is more frequent, and the physical and psychological damage is greater. A social worker who works as an anti-domestic violence worker has copied the anti-domestic violence proposal and posted it on the ground floor of the community. He hung up for several days without being torn down by the cleaning lady, i think I also copy a few copies, each unit posted, but we community elderly people, young couples quite rare, the elderly have no energy to beat, at most is a verbal insult?

A 1926 newspaper article on Women's dress still reads well: Modern Women, only clear mind, sound physique, lively spirit... Let's look back at the lessons of thousands of years past, before it was wearing ring wear Jingdang, bow shoes thin, only make Iraq inch difficult to move, now the dress is exquisite lively, generous behavior, to make Iraq everywhere... really beautiful, not entirely by decoration out, most always from the reflection of the heart, therefore, to be truly beautiful, one must first cultivate one's inner self, benefiting from the outside world, such as warm sunshine, fresh air, and benefiting from one's own, such as lively thoughts, lively life, this is really beautiful... I often think there must be a lot of women, often occurred to a feeling, I can grow up to be extremely beautiful on... sure, natural beauty, is a very lucky thing in life, but I think beauty is in many ways, it can be said that there are no standards, because each has its own characteristics, each has its own strengths, so if Yi really understands that Yi has no strengths at all, of course it is irreversible, but I think it would never be so cruel, our country has always praised beautiful women, so many cruel things have happened. Up to now this kind of despotic thought can be completely eliminated. A woman only needs to understand in what way she is good at something, just go to the one side of his own situation, the result will not be a failure.

These days on the Internet, "Chinese Women" , "Chinese men" speech, funny and jokes like, is not some children did not start school, at home classes, suffocated, romance novel see too much, mind is "Fengguanxia Pei, waiting for a good son to ride the white horse married" , I read the ancient romance also do not have these scenes Ah, is it because the former popular abuse, the main male and female toss of the dead to come and go, I abuse in the quilt tears, where there is a white horse rescue dust drama, only the war horse love kill each other, now popular silly white sweet, sweet cookies, do not want money, harm, it is better to see more dog blood abuse, several pot of dog blood poured on the top of the head, will not count on Chinese men this play.

In a screenshot, when asked what to do about domestic violence, the Chinese man replied that it was a family matter, not a "state matter. " He happened to read a report about an increase in domestic violence during pneumonia. Victims of domestic violence were trapped at home, even if they ran out in time, there are no hotel shelters open outside, even a convenience store or fast food restaurant can not hide for a while. If you are injured, it is difficult to find a hospital or clinic that is willing to issue a certificate for dealing with the injury, the police force prioritizes cases related to pneumonia, and is rarely willing to visit people's homes for safety reasons, mostly on the phone and in mud; being locked up at home is stressful, anxious and irritable, with incomes falling and expenses rising, it makes the abuser take out his anger on the victim more frequently, the number of domestic violence is more frequent, and the physical and psychological damage is greater. A social worker who works as an anti-domestic violence worker has copied the anti-domestic violence proposal and posted it on the ground floor of the community. He hung up for several days without being torn down by the cleaning lady, i think I also copy a few copies, each unit posted, but we community elderly people, young couples quite rare, the elderly have no energy to beat, at most is a verbal insult?

A 1926 newspaper article on Women's dress still reads well: Modern Women, only clear mind, sound physique, lively spirit... Let's look back at the lessons of thousands of years past, before it was wearing ring wear Jingdang, bow shoes thin, only make Iraq inch difficult to move, now the dress is exquisite lively, generous behavior, to make Iraq everywhere... really beautiful, not entirely by decoration out, most always from the reflection of the heart, therefore, to be truly beautiful, one must first cultivate one's inner self, benefiting from the outside world, such as warm sunshine, fresh air, and benefiting from one's own, such as lively thoughts, lively life, this is really beautiful... I often think there must be a lot of women, often occurred to a feeling, I can grow up to be extremely beautiful on... sure, natural beauty, is a very lucky thing in life, but I think beauty is in many ways, it can be said that there are no standards, because each has its own characteristics, each has its own strengths, so if Yi really understands that Yi has no strengths at all, of course it is irreversible, but I think it would never be so cruel, our country has always praised beautiful women, so many cruel things have happened. Up to now this kind of despotic thought can be completely eliminated. A woman only needs to understand in what way she is good at something, just go to the one side of his own situation, the result will not be a failure.
