"Two children are only six months away from 'death! ' " Was the title of a public article on August 21 last year by Yiwu's two children's Daily Products Co. , Ltd. . This quote-unquote "death" in six months, actually became a lot of enterprises in the immediate plight.

It is urgent to resume work, but the new crown epidemic is still, from the government to enterprises to individuals, are bound hand and foot.

When Yiwu went ahead and became one of the first cities to push for the resumption of work, public opinion gave a voice: "Yiwu people deserve to earn money! " This was a compliment with a contrasting mentality, and people hoped to compare their samples, to move forward more quickly and safely on what must be done.

In mid-february, the Zhejiang provincial government began to hire cars, charter flights and organize high-speed trains to pick up migrant workers and return to work, from which we can feel the urgency of the province and the ability to act.

On Feb. 24,170 passengers, including a passenger named Zhu gang and four of his fellow villagers, returned to Yiwu from Shaanxi Province on a special rework plane that landed in Yiwu from Hanzhong Chenggu Airport, on the same flight back to work.

The return flight from Shaanxi to Yiwu

However, "returning" is not entirely accurate. Among the five, Zhu gang also brought new employees from his hometown, because Zhu gang felt that "the welfare benefits of the factory are still acceptable. " Plus the company for the "old with the new" also launched incentive policies, the factory needs workers, workers need to work, smoothly.

With the workers in place, the total number of children Straw employees back to work at the end of February reached two-thirds, and production capacity has recovered to 70 percent of the same period last year.

This is the data given to us by Lou Zhongping, chairman of Shuangtong Straw, and according to his division of the pace of the resumption of work in the factory, the positioning of Zhu gang and his fellow villagers indicates that the Enterprise has entered the third stage of full resumption of work. As one of the first companies in Yiwu to be allowed to resume work, Lou Zhongping told us that virtually all the preparations had started on February 4.

A little background on the Double Baby Straw. Founded in 1994, this private enterprise specializes in the research, development, production and sales of drinking straws. The company covers an area of 15,000 square meters and has more than 200 production lines of various kinds of straws. The enterprise employs more than 450 people and produces nearly 10,000 tons (over 20 billion straws) of various kinds of straws every year, the product supplies the domestic and foreign, is in the Global Straw profession to be in the leading position.

Can stand in the back echelon of the premise is large enough, which also answers the question why back to work is a double child Straw.

All the answers, of course, go beyond that. Why two children? Why Zhejiang? Does going back to work mean everything's back to normal?

Under these questions, chairman Lou Zhongping talked to us about his experience and thinking in the process of resuming work in the enterprise.

Early fast, late bottleneck

We were one of the first six companies in Yiwu to allow us to go back to work.

On February 3, Zhejiang Province issued a document, "Zhejiang enterprises to resume work and epidemic prevention and control of 17 provisions" (17 for short) , at that time the city has convened a part of the enterprise meeting, our enterprise as the first batch to be convened. At that time, enterprises were encouraged to declare voluntarily, and the government conducted risk assessment and then approved it through the guidance of enterprises on epidemic prevention.

Between February 3rd and 4th, we reached about half of the management and business levels, section administrators, including technicians, to sixty people, and start work to around the 10th, to about a third of the General Staff, altogether there were about a hundred people, about one-fourth to one-fifth of the total staff of our factory at that time.

After the 10th, our government introduced various support policies, set up 10 working groups, to the provinces, major labor export provinces, to help our enterprises bring back employees. In the beginning, there was a bus, a chartered bus, then a high-speed train, then a chartered plane. During this process, one after another, the employee's ports are opened.

From the 10th to the 20th, the situation of our entire staff is that 95% of the administrative staff, department staff, technical staff and sales staff are in place, and the average staff is only about half.

Employees arrive at Yiwu airport by charter flight

After the 20th, the staff came in very slowly. The reason it's so slow is that the places that are coming out, through our encouragement, through the efforts of the government, are coming out.

There's all kinds of reasons why you can't get out.

There are places where employees have to get health certificates. During the process of getting health certificates, we learned that many employees are very difficult. During the process of doing this, three or four official seals may have to be stamped in the town, and one department has to sign by another department, that's not something that a junior employee can do, and they don't have a car.

There are places that can come out, and the staff really wants to come out, but he doesn't have a bus, or he doesn't even have a road in town, and some people close it, but no one recovers, and it just keeps cutting off. Anyway, all kinds of questions.

Now Yiwu has expanded from 10 working groups to 50 working groups, and has been detailed to various regions. Our factory has also set up a working group, specifically to resume work as an important thing in the push. With our Yiwu team, to the local in addition to recalling the old staff, but also hope to open the entrance of new staff.

So far, we've added twenty new employees, all brought in by older employees, because we've also put in place some incentive hiring policies.

Why aren't there any new employees back there? The labor market is not fully open. One now requires up to 200 enterprises to enter and recruit workers, tens of thousands of enterprises across Yiwu; the other allows up to 800 people to enter and find jobs. Two hundred enterprises, one enterprise four people, the transaction rate is very low. We can not send a few people over, one person can not recruit a person, this is unacceptable for the enterprise.

Be A standard-setter

Our enterprises can be said to be the first batch of enterprises in the country to issue standardized re-work epidemic prevention process, and later we reported it to the National Standardization Committee.

We carry on the rapid organization structure temporary construction, is actually the original enterprise to the management of a set of standardized system, applied to our epidemic prevention. Because we all know, the progress and development of modern industry, depends on standardized thinking, that is, modularity.

In this way of thinking, we have formed a standard operating procedure before the 10th. First set up the epidemic prevention work temporary headquarters, and then divide the work to the flow control, isolation diagnosis and treatment, environmental eradication, publicity and education, material preparation five groups.

The organization structure of the anti-epidemic of double-child Straw

That's where people come in. When this working group was set up, on February 4, we had no one here. Only I and the general manager came back from Sanya. The other people were all ordinary employees staying in the factory. Only one or two cadres were left in the factory. At that time, there were no cadres available, so four out of five of our teams are using regular workers.

It is in critical moments that we are able to break through the hierarchy, to break down the boundaries of power, to empower. Put young people to use and hold them accountable in the process of empowering them. I think it's important when it comes down to it.

Crises don't just happen

I do not think that the crisis is a sudden thing, this law is not periodic, but it is periodic, that is, the crisis this thing, it must be a natural law, always will come.

Since it will come, either before or after you have to prepare.

Whether the organization's sense of crisis is strong or not determines whether your organization can survive the crisis. We usually attach importance to this crisis, there is a slogan is "two children left to die only six months. ". People are always aware, and when a crisis comes, we have a way to deal with it.

The crisis has had a big impact on two types of companies: the First, over-invested and over-leveraged; the second, in transition. In both cases, our company is right in the middle.

Last year, we just finished the construction of a new factory building. We just moved the machines in during the Spring Festival. Before the installation, the new factory building was 450,000 square meters, and a little over 100 million yuan was invested. We only made a straw for 26 years, but at the end of last year, we have definitely moved from Straw to biodegradable bags, which is the production of Biodegradable plastic bags, a part of the equipment has been pulled back years ago, is also a major investment in enterprise transformation.

But I'm not worried. Our sense of crisis is: First, be conservative financially; second, be conservative strategically and transform tactically.

The Place of closure is closed, financially closed. Where is it open? It's open in management technology and everything. After we completed the second phase of the plant last year, our enterprise still has not gone bankrupt, or has a cash reserve.

For us, there is fear, but no panic. Fear will motivate you, but panic will disorient you and make you misjudge.

As a business, do not die well that is the right. An enterprise is essentially the same as a human being. It is an organism that eats the weak, metabolizes the weak, and follows the laws of nature.

Why is Zhejiang "anxious" ?

I think this crisis from the national point of view, the enterprises in Zhejiang is the greatest harm. Because Zhejiang Enterprise individual is smallest, most dispersive, industrial chain is the least compact.

Like before February 20, what we want is nothing, after 20, the upstream supply chain is better, the downstream supply chain is still YTHT, what we want is nothing. Because a product is dozens of, hundreds of things combined together, missing a thing even a small label, is not a complete product.

These supply chain enterprises are grass-roots type, often very fine division of labor, they do not have the depth of the industrial chain. This compact ecosystem is very dynamic, but once destroyed, it is difficult to recover and takes a lot of time.

Since February 4th, the government has been pressing us hard, giving us a week to prepare, and we must resume work on the 10th. At the beginning, we had to declare before we could resume work. Later, according to the development of the epidemic, the conditions for resuming work have also been changing all the time. By the 15th or so, we can start the preparation work. After the 17th or 18th, I don't think it's necessary to report, all enterprises as long as they meet the conditions, and then ask the community to see if you have a mask, disinfectant, isolation clothes, isolation rooms, have set up this epidemic prevention work team, there can be started.

We have been raising a lot of supplies such as masks and disinfection water since years ago, and the government will distribute them to us. When we were short-handed, the government organized some volunteers to do temporary work for us to support our rapid recovery.

Volunteers enter factory building to help resume production

In the nine days between February 26th and March 5th, the government also demanded that teams be sent to various places, each bringing back 2,000 people and 50 teams bringing back 100,000 people. The head of the working group called us all day long: Do you have any employees over there? Give them to me as soon as possible. I'll pull them back for you. Or He's not GonNa get the job done.

Don't you think Zhejiang is the province with the most perfect market mechanism? The market is rational, I think Zhejiang or Yiwu, it is based on such a rational environment, made some judgments.

For the epidemic, for the recovery of the production economy, Zhejiang is two-pronged, two-pronged hard. This is based on the market-oriented, development-based administrative thinking. After all, we all realize that a pandemic, terrible as it is, is no worse than an economic collapse.

OurCity
Post-construction period

We have entered a stage after the resumption of work, order shortage these problems began to emerge at this stage, for our enterprises will have such pressure.

I believe that most businesses have stress, it must be a common problem.

The sales side has had a big impact on us at the moment. Our products are related to food. Our customers in the European Union are on the fence. Some of them have also returned their orders. Currently, orders for January and February are less than a quarter of those for the same period last year.

The current situation is that the futures can not dry out, there are goods can not be shipped out, shipped out of the ship is limited, all aspects of the problem. Our traditional markets are the European Union, Japan and South Korea, and if they get out of hand, the damage to companies like ours could be worse than the epidemic at home.

Because in the first half of the year we have to recruit enough staff, but after recruiting enough and no orders to do, it is very embarrassing things.

Crisis is a thing, its influence first, it is lag, second, it is recessive.

We now go to the streets to see, the proportion of shops up is extremely low, may really be less than 10% . In this case, you seem to be missing a month, two months of money, but in fact it is not so, the economy is an industrial chain, is an industrial scale resonance.

Why are there so few shops on the streets now? Because we are still in the wait-and-see between each other, to some extent, we are entering a vicious circle or a vicious circle. In other words, you think no one and no business, and then you don't drive and I don't drive, driving fewer and fewer people, fewer and fewer cases of consumers do not. A long time the entire industrial chain broken, broken after the recovery of the industrial chain needs time.

The process will have far-reaching consequences.

Charter, charter flights, organized high-speed rail special train, Zhejiang Province for the resumption of urgent work in a series of measures revealed. Why Zhejiang? Why the rush to get back to work? Does going back to work mean everything's back to normal? In order to answer these questions, we found Shuangtong Straw, a leading private enterprise in Yiwu City, Zhejiang Province, and talked with Chairman Lou Zhongping about his experience in returning to work.

"Two children are only six months away from 'death! ' " Was the title of a public article on August 21 last year by Yiwu's two children's Daily Products Co. , Ltd. . This quote-unquote "death" in six months, actually became a lot of enterprises in the immediate plight.

It is urgent to resume work, but the new crown epidemic is still, from the government to enterprises to individuals, are bound hand and foot.

When Yiwu went ahead and became one of the first cities to push for the resumption of work, public opinion gave a voice: "Yiwu people deserve to earn money! " This was a compliment with a contrasting mentality, and people hoped to compare their samples, to move forward more quickly and safely on what must be done.

In mid-february, the Zhejiang provincial government began to hire cars, charter flights and organize high-speed trains to pick up migrant workers and return to work, from which we can feel the urgency of the province and the ability to act.

On Feb. 24,170 passengers, including a passenger named Zhu gang and four of his fellow villagers, returned to Yiwu from Shaanxi Province on a special rework plane that landed in Yiwu from Hanzhong Chenggu Airport, on the same flight back to work.

In mid-february, the Zhejiang provincial government began to hire cars, charter flights and organize high-speed trains to pick up migrant workers and return to work, from which we can feel the urgency of the province and the ability to act.

On Feb. 24,170 passengers, including a passenger named Zhu gang and four of his fellow villagers, returned to Yiwu from Shaanxi Province on a special rework plane that landed in Yiwu from Hanzhong Chenggu Airport, on the same flight back to work.

The return flight from Shaanxi to Yiwu

However, "returning" is not entirely accurate. Among the five, Zhu gang also brought new employees from his hometown, because Zhu gang felt that "the welfare benefits of the factory are still acceptable. " Plus the company for the "old with the new" also launched incentive policies, the factory needs workers, workers need to work, smoothly.

With the workers in place, the total number of children Straw employees back to work at the end of February reached two-thirds, and production capacity has recovered to 70 percent of the same period last year.

This is the data given to us by Lou Zhongping, chairman of Shuangtong Straw, and according to his division of the pace of the resumption of work in the factory, the positioning of Zhu gang and his fellow villagers indicates that the Enterprise has entered the third stage of full resumption of work. As one of the first companies in Yiwu to be allowed to resume work, Lou Zhongping told us that virtually all the preparations had started on February 4.

A little background on the Double Baby Straw. Founded in 1994, this private enterprise specializes in the research, development, production and sales of drinking straws. The company covers an area of 15,000 square meters and has more than 200 production lines of various kinds of straws. The enterprise employs more than 450 people and produces nearly 10,000 tons (over 20 billion straws) of various kinds of straws every year, the product supplies the domestic and foreign, is in the Global Straw profession to be in the leading position.

Can stand in the back echelon of the premise is large enough, which also answers the question why back to work is a double child Straw.

All the answers, of course, go beyond that. Why two children? Why Zhejiang? Does going back to work mean everything's back to normal?

Under these questions, chairman Lou Zhongping talked to us about his experience and thinking in the process of resuming work in the enterprise.

Early fast, late bottleneck

We were one of the first six companies in Yiwu to allow us to go back to work.

On February 3, Zhejiang Province issued a document, "Zhejiang enterprises to resume work and epidemic prevention and control of 17 provisions" (17 for short) , at that time the city has convened a part of the enterprise meeting, our enterprise as the first batch to be convened. At that time, enterprises were encouraged to declare voluntarily, and the government conducted risk assessment and then approved it through the guidance of enterprises on epidemic prevention.

Between February 3rd and 4th, we reached about half of the management and business levels, section administrators, including technicians, to sixty people, and start work to around the 10th, to about a third of the General Staff, altogether there were about a hundred people, about one-fourth to one-fifth of the total staff of our factory at that time.

After the 10th, our government introduced various support policies, set up 10 working groups, to the provinces, major labor export provinces, to help our enterprises bring back employees. In the beginning, there was a bus, a chartered bus, then a high-speed train, then a chartered plane. During this process, one after another, the employee's ports are opened.

From the 10th to the 20th, the situation of our entire staff is that 95% of the administrative staff, department staff, technical staff and sales staff are in place, and the average staff is only about half.

Employees arrive at Yiwu airport by charter flight

After the 20th, the staff came in very slowly. The reason it's so slow is that the places that are coming out, through our encouragement, through the efforts of the government, are coming out.

There's all kinds of reasons why you can't get out.

There are places where employees have to get health certificates. During the process of getting health certificates, we learned that many employees are very difficult. During the process of doing this, three or four official seals may have to be stamped in the town, and one department has to sign by another department, that's not something that a junior employee can do, and they don't have a car.

There are places that can come out, and the staff really wants to come out, but he doesn't have a bus, or he doesn't even have a road in town, and some people close it, but no one recovers, and it just keeps cutting off. Anyway, all kinds of questions.

Now Yiwu has expanded from 10 working groups to 50 working groups, and has been detailed to various regions. Our factory has also set up a working group, specifically to resume work as an important thing in the push. With our Yiwu team, to the local in addition to recalling the old staff, but also hope to open the entrance of new staff.

So far, we've added twenty new employees, all brought in by older employees, because we've also put in place some incentive hiring policies.

Why aren't there any new employees back there? The labor market is not fully open. One now requires up to 200 enterprises to enter and recruit workers, tens of thousands of enterprises across Yiwu; the other allows up to 800 people to enter and find jobs. Two hundred enterprises, one enterprise four people, the transaction rate is very low. We can not send a few people over, one person can not recruit a person, this is unacceptable for the enterprise.

Be A standard-setter

Be A standard-setter

Our enterprises can be said to be the first batch of enterprises in the country to issue standardized re-work epidemic prevention process, and later we reported it to the National Standardization Committee.

We carry on the rapid organization structure temporary construction, is actually the original enterprise to the management of a set of standardized system, applied to our epidemic prevention. Because we all know, the progress and development of modern industry, depends on standardized thinking, that is, modularity.

In this way of thinking, we have formed a standard operating procedure before the 10th. First set up the epidemic prevention work temporary headquarters, and then divide the work to the flow control, isolation diagnosis and treatment, environmental eradication, publicity and education, material preparation five groups.

The organization structure of the anti-epidemic of double-child Straw

That's where people come in. When this working group was set up, on February 4, we had no one here. Only I and the general manager came back from Sanya. The other people were all ordinary employees staying in the factory. Only one or two cadres were left in the factory. At that time, there were no cadres available, so four out of five of our teams are using regular workers.

It is in critical moments that we are able to break through the hierarchy, to break down the boundaries of power, to empower. Put young people to use and hold them accountable in the process of empowering them. I think it's important when it comes down to it.

Crises don't just happen

Crises don't just happen

I do not think that the crisis is a sudden thing, this law is not periodic, but it is periodic, that is, the crisis this thing, it must be a natural law, always will come.

Since it will come, either before or after you have to prepare.

Whether the organization's sense of crisis is strong or not determines whether your organization can survive the crisis. We usually attach importance to this crisis, there is a slogan is "two children left to die only six months. ". People are always aware, and when a crisis comes, we have a way to deal with it.

The crisis has had a big impact on two types of companies: the First, over-invested and over-leveraged; the second, in transition. In both cases, our company is right in the middle.

Last year, we just finished the construction of a new factory building. We just moved the machines in during the Spring Festival. Before the installation, the new factory building was 450,000 square meters, and a little over 100 million yuan was invested. We only made a straw for 26 years, but at the end of last year, we have definitely moved from Straw to biodegradable bags, which is the production of Biodegradable plastic bags, a part of the equipment has been pulled back years ago, is also a major investment in enterprise transformation.

But I'm not worried. Our sense of crisis is: First, be conservative financially; second, be conservative strategically and transform tactically.

The Place of closure is closed, financially closed. Where is it open? It's open in management technology and everything. After we completed the second phase of the plant last year, our enterprise still has not gone bankrupt, or has a cash reserve.

For us, there is fear, but no panic. Fear will motivate you, but panic will disorient you and make you misjudge.

As a business, do not die well that is the right. An enterprise is essentially the same as a human being. It is an organism that eats the weak, metabolizes the weak, and follows the laws of nature.

Why is Zhejiang "anxious" ?

Why is Zhejiang "anxious" ?

I think this crisis from the national point of view, the enterprises in Zhejiang is the greatest harm. Because Zhejiang Enterprise individual is smallest, most dispersive, industrial chain is the least compact.

Like before February 20, what we want is nothing, after 20, the upstream supply chain is better, the downstream supply chain is still YTHT, what we want is nothing. Because a product is dozens of, hundreds of things combined together, missing a thing even a small label, is not a complete product.

These supply chain enterprises are grass-roots type, often very fine division of labor, they do not have the depth of the industrial chain. This compact ecosystem is very dynamic, but once destroyed, it is difficult to recover and takes a lot of time.

Since February 4th, the government has been pressing us hard, giving us a week to prepare, and we must resume work on the 10th. At the beginning, we had to declare before we could resume work. Later, according to the development of the epidemic, the conditions for resuming work have also been changing all the time. By the 15th or so, we can start the preparation work. After the 17th or 18th, I don't think it's necessary to report, all enterprises as long as they meet the conditions, and then ask the community to see if you have a mask, disinfectant, isolation clothes, isolation rooms, have set up this epidemic prevention work team, there can be started.

We have been raising a lot of supplies such as masks and disinfection water since years ago, and the government will distribute them to us. When we were short-handed, the government organized some volunteers to do temporary work for us to support our rapid recovery.

Volunteers enter factory building to help resume production

In the nine days between February 26th and March 5th, the government also demanded that teams be sent to various places, each bringing back 2,000 people and 50 teams bringing back 100,000 people. The head of the working group called us all day long: Do you have any employees over there? Give them to me as soon as possible. I'll pull them back for you. Or He's not GonNa get the job done.

Don't you think Zhejiang is the province with the most perfect market mechanism? The market is rational, I think Zhejiang or Yiwu, it is based on such a rational environment, made some judgments.

For the epidemic, for the recovery of the production economy, Zhejiang is two-pronged, two-pronged hard. This is based on the market-oriented, development-based administrative thinking. After all, we all realize that a pandemic, terrible as it is, is no worse than an economic collapse.

Post-construction period

Post-construction period

We have entered a stage after the resumption of work, order shortage these problems began to emerge at this stage, for our enterprises will have such pressure.

I believe that most businesses have stress, it must be a common problem.

The sales side has had a big impact on us at the moment. Our products are related to food. Our customers in the European Union are on the fence. Some of them have also returned their orders. Currently, orders for January and February are less than a quarter of those for the same period last year.

The current situation is that the futures can not dry out, there are goods can not be shipped out, shipped out of the ship is limited, all aspects of the problem. Our traditional markets are the European Union, Japan and South Korea, and if they get out of hand, the damage to companies like ours could be worse than the epidemic at home.

Because in the first half of the year we have to recruit enough staff, but after recruiting enough and no orders to do, it is very embarrassing things.

Crisis is a thing, its influence first, it is lag, second, it is recessive.

We now go to the streets to see, the proportion of shops up is extremely low, may really be less than 10% . In this case, you seem to be missing a month, two months of money, but in fact it is not so, the economy is an industrial chain, is an industrial scale resonance.

Why are there so few shops on the streets now? Because we are still in the wait-and-see between each other, to some extent, we are entering a vicious circle or a vicious circle. In other words, you think no one and no business, and then you don't drive and I don't drive, driving fewer and fewer people, fewer and fewer cases of consumers do not. A long time the entire industrial chain broken, broken after the recovery of the industrial chain needs time.

The process will have far-reaching consequences.
