##Diary of the siege of Wuhan | Day 8

Techread

Features, Lanxi, founder of zhulu.com  , focuses on in-depth observations and business reviews of Internet startups, new media, and subcultures.

In the middle of the day, it was unprecedented to see Wallace and Pérignon dominate the top and second Western food rankings in their respective regions.

The Algorithm is also very helpless, only a few players in the competition, either you first or he second, really no way.

In addition to the handful of restaurants that have stayed open, the gaming industry has seen a slight uptick in sales as a result of the outbreak, and as far as I can tell, both end-of-the-month and mobile games companies have had better-than-expected pipeline growth this month, especially in the card game, the data is good enough to explode.

Some people say that this is the ultimate ideal for Otaku, the legal holiday time is constantly extended, the official ban on social gatherings, can only be justified at home to play video games, it seems not unreasonable.

It is a pity that the depression of the heart is not the counterbalance of this artificial happiness, the cost of living in a house, is that billions of people are living in fear and anxiety through this holiday, which is supposed to be a family reunion.

And when the eight people who first spread the rumor in Wuhan yesterday were all doctors, the beginning of the matter became a little more absurd.

Most people understand the so-called "rumor" of the picture, is nothing more than the idle society of the unemployed, fear the world is not in disorder, thoughtlessly random information on the Internet to attract attention, and then was a wise Public Security Bureau quickly arrested, confessed.

Who would have thought that such an attempt to seek a sterile environment would end up killing healthy cells as well as chemotherapy, and how many of them were killed in the first place as a result of this highly publicized "rumor-dispelling" and law enforcement, do you honestly believe that the case of pneumonia in Wuhan is not very dangerous?

I also do not understand, has come to this point, there are people in the mouth of the word "SARS" , said obviously is not SARS, the eight people said the wrong, false.

Come on, the COVID-19 wasn't named yet, and SARS was a coronavirus, under cognitive limitation, the expression ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— --.

Moreover, to stress that SARS was not about informing the public about the structure or composition of the virus, but rather about its inestimable infectiousness, is an extremely important warning that should not be dismissed as a rumor.

Besides, is it true that police enforcement procedures went to a biological laboratory to verify that the virus was not SARS, and then, in the spirit of Seek truth from facts science, summoned the eight doctors?

That's obviously not possible. The whole logic of the case is familiar to those who live in the land:

The key word SARS has a unique painful memory in China. Spreading the news that someone has contracted SARS in the society is bound to cause mass panic, disturb the stability of the masses, and add chaos to the government. Therefore, it is necessary to strangle the source of the spread, stop passing on the bad press that affects the whole situation.

In other words, in the optimistic judgment, Wuhan's original intention in dealing with the "rumour-mongering" incident was not to conceal the true situation, but rather to pursue stability in a Classical conditioning manner, unwilling to pose a social risk.

But it is this kind of mechanical manipulation that, after squashing social risk, unleashes the higher cost of addressing health risks, though perhaps no one is subjectively malevolent -- whether a police officer or an official, would be happy to see the virus go out of control, as if every single one of these participants was doing exactly what it was supposed to do, which was to push things in the wrong direction.

They say that practice is the sole test of truth, and I do not hold myself against it, nor do I hold myself against it, for the law enforcement powers that ever were, as they were, but I hope that your process of refuting rumors can abide by the principle of testing the truth through practice. Don't simply say so-and-so to fabricate rumors, list what he said, and also list the evidence that can prove what he said is not true, if the latter evidence is missing, then the former judgment is not valid.

In fact, I also very doubt, now how many people can distinguish what is rumor, what is wrong, in my opinion, confusing the two brought about by the ambiguity, perhaps even more problematic.
