February on the south coast is already beginning to feel like early summer, with Golden Pollen clearly falling from trees as the sun shines through the warm wind.

Every day at 2:00 pm, after typing in the latest help-seeking posts on Weibo, I walk out of the library and go home. Waiting for my fellow volunteers to wake up for more than two hours is my daily breathing space. But I could still escape, if only I could cover the screen and see the sun again.

Domestic seven or eight in the morning, the night before the partners have been waking up one after another. The information in the group also spins quickly:

"The old man from XX, who was entered yesterday, has passed away after receiving feedback. "
"XXX has been admitted. "
"I went to check... just called, posted yesterday, just died... "
"The XX old man who was entered yesterday has passed away. "
"A patient just got on the bus to the hospital and was gone. "
"Is there anything we can do about this patient's condition? "
"There's still one person who needs to make this half-page call. Who Will? "
"Can the situation at@xx  be flagged as critical? "
"We have a patient who reported xx for our reference. "

Under the constant bombardment of information, everyone is concentrating on his part of the work, some people turn to information, some people input, some people call to verify, some people fill out various forms to report, other requests that can not be categorized will try to find organizations that can be docked. Sometimes after a quick read of a few hundred messages, pressed the time to submit a form, discussed a problem with my friends late into the night, and was about to turn off the computer and go to sleep, I realized that I had been holding my breath.

No surprise, then, is a long time can not go to sleep, or wake up early in the night.

Since the outbreak began in early January, I haven't slept well, even though I'm 10,000 miles away in the United States. My husband studied in Wuhan, where we have a common good memory, never thought the mind of Spring Cherry and hot and dry surface of Wuhan will be associated with "pneumonia" , "epidemic" these two words.

For the first week, I watched domestic and international reports and microblogs, and worked with netizens to worry about medical staff, patients and people in Wuhan who had nowhere to stay, and to pursue the Red Cross for corruption. I still can't do anything after giving money to the alumni association. I realized that my anxiety was rooted in powerlessness, and that there was nothing I could do to alleviate it.

At the beginning of February, I was introduced by a friend to join the volunteer group, and then joined seven related groups one after another.

I was amazed by the power of the volunteers and their careful exploration of the needs of the patients. As soon as the outbreak began, volunteers gathered online and quickly divided themselves into teams based on their expertise and needs: to spread knowledge about the epidemic and ways to prevent it; to gather and compile information for help, medical, social workers and psychological volunteers will provide medical answers and help to the patients and their families who have not been hospitalized. Some patients will be provided with oxygen machines Collect and update bed information, hospitals and testing procedures for nucleic acid testing in Wuhan and surrounding counties and cities; Provide Hospital Information and assistance to pregnant women left behind in Wuhan; solicit local volunteers to provide and exchange information on supply and demand; Transport of medical supplies, transport of medical staff and patients, production of disease-related posters, and so on.

Because of the Awkward Jet Lag at home, I do a lot of things and see what I can do in my group. Sometimes I would call the hospital to ask about the admission process and contact the person seeking help to verify information. Most of the time I would travel between groups, collecting help information, filling out forms, and sending personal messages to the person seeking help to verify information, to help people find a way into a hospital.

Bad Sleep doesn't bother me anymore. There's so much to do, if you wake up in the morning, just get up and work with your buddies.

From time to time in the volunteer community, we see updates from members of the group about the person asking for help. We'd cheer for the person getting better or being hospitalized, but we'd also often receive a death notification. Every time we see a recorded patient die, there is a brief silence in the busy group, and then we comfort each other, cheer each other, and move on.

One day, we put a lot of energy into the death of a caller, we received the news is very sad. "The work we're doing is meaningful, and we're trying to get more people out of the numbers, " said one, a daily reason to keep going.

Walking down the sunlit boulevards and sitting in the spacious library collecting information for help, I often feel trapped in a schizophrenic dream. The spring is deep here and the clouds are gloomy there.

Even though the volunteers had collected a lot of help posts during the day, I could still see a dozen new ones in the early hours of the morning. Those rescues are heartbreaking, and so humble: "My grandfather is dead, my grandmother is dying, please help us, " "my husband is only thirty-five, help this family! " "We have three people infected, we can only hope to send dad to the hospital first. " "sorry to use public resources, I really tried everything. "I learned that in Wuhan they call my grandmother 'home' , unfortunately, the way I know the word is by asking for help: "GRANDPA is dead, my family is very ill, I don't want to lose my family again! " Many people lose several relatives in a month, but when asking for help, instead, they apologize for causing problems on the Internet.

One day at four in the morning in China, I sent a private message asking for the addresses and telephone numbers of three bloggers who asked for help. I immediately received a reply. Guess they're still up, holding out hope for the long night. One of them is a medical staff, the family does not have a bed, she has done atomization, medication, oxygen and other operations, but the elderly relatives or the situation is getting worse. After exchanging messages in private, she thanked me and gently told me to get some rest, too. In a short exchange, she gave me more warmth than I could ever give her. A few days later, I sneaked back to her page and saw that her family had been hospitalized and she was still fighting the virus herself.

Another day, a netizen posts a appeal for help, the elder dies a few days, the body has not been transported away. I sent her a list of all the local funeral homes, and I told her that I had collected the medical records of her relatives. She thanked me: "It's too much trouble. " I tried to tell her that no one should be ashamed to live sorry, to gain basic rights, only to reply clumsily: "No one should have to go through this. "

In the face of their pain, any language seems powerless, Pale.

In this half month, the most let my heart is always the old people.

When collecting help information from microblogs, many netizens want to "tell the truth frankly" , advising bloggers that the elderly are too old to be saved, which is a waste of medical resources, as well as those who say "it's better to be euthanized" . There are older people who are less likely to use micro-blog pictures, did not post medical bills, was besieged by netizens "rumors" , "No map on the report.

Another blogger suggested "sacrificing this generation of old people" to "preserve the generations to come" . My anger had turned into a deep well of pain, for in reality, the old had been the first to be sacrificed. Late at night a few days ago, a group of people sent for help. More than 30 old people who should have been sent to the shelter were rejected because they were too old. They were dragged near the railway station to lay down and freeze in the cold wind. Volunteers in different groups immediately began to look for a car to pick up, call contact, report the status of the elderly in the group again and again, finally at 1:30 in the morning to all the elderly home.

These old men are not alone. When the mandatory criteria required all confirmed patients to be admitted, there were elderly people who could not care for themselves at the isolation point and were not given medication and their condition worsened; there were elderly people who were sent home from the isolation point and had their families contact the bed themselves. Frustrated, the volunteers who were eventually admitted to the hospital or placed in isolation soon received several tearful family members complaining that the patient had been left unattended, without medication, and was getting sicker. However, as long as the patient is sent to the isolation point is not "untreated" , volunteers can not help. I didn't dare to think deeply, suspecting that I was also involved in creating their situation, fearing that what I called "help" was merely pushing the person in need into another abyss.

I was thrilled when we opened up new lines of care that would allow us to move some of our critically ill patients faster. I had just added the name of a person who asked for help on Wechat. Her name, which is the same as my friend's, made me feel very familiar. Ask The age, the original aunt more than 50, in their 70 or 80-year-old parents for help, filled out all the forms can be filled, but the parents have not been admitted, the illness has been very difficult to wait. I immediately asked my aunt for her medical records again, telling her firmly that I would report it. Did Not expect to fill out the form, the declaration of the rules will be updated: mainly to accept patients under 60 years of age, the elderly or other patients do not include the same wait, all back to square one. But most of the people on this list who are in critical condition are elderly. Waiting, in a way, means waiting to die. I felt guilty, I felt like I had let my aunt down, and I was afraid that telling her would make her more desperate. Every day since then, I've been sneaking in to see how she's doing, afraid of bad news. Fortunately, the day before yesterday, my aunt's mother finally admitted to the hospital, I was a little relieved.

The elderly are lucky to have relatives and children to help set things up. Many elderly people living alone, unattended, once sick, even there may be no chance of rescue, by the time the information of illness outside the world was known, already dying.

At a time when the number of infections is so large, I understand that the majority of the elderly have underlying diseases, that infections are dangerous, that young people are more likely to survive treatment, and that medical resources are in short supply. But while microblogs praise retirees and poor elderly people for donating their life savings, the elderly are the last to be considered. If we can not take into account the needs of the weakest in society, at least we can not rationalize this neglect. An elderly man plunged into despair -- as if his death sent the message to several volunteer groups, all of whom wanted to help his wife. She was sixty-eight and was admitted shortly after his death. Everyone should be ashamed of the society that makes the elderly pay such a terrible price for their families'beds.

The reason why some netizens can say "give up old people" confidently, but because our society is running according to this logic. This Social Darwin logic drains everyone, cuts off empathy and mutual aid, and ruthlessly abandons useless tools, even to the point of shame. But the young will eventually become the old, then how do we go into their own night?

Maybe we can give up old people for generations to come, but that kind of reproduction, cold death, but is the Zombie replacement iteration.

On the evening of June 6th, after the death of Dr Li, a wave of grief broke out on the Internet. Early in the morning to see the message, I have long backlog of sadness also burst out, crying for a long time. However, before dawn, the voice urged everyone not to "fan the wind and light the fire, " "make use of the issue, " to "rational view, " for Dr. Lee is in the end the "whistle-blower" debate, which is very sad.

Isn't the point to reflect on why Dr. Lee was admonished, how to avoid the next Dr. Lee, and how to contain the epidemic in a more timely manner? Why are we so afraid of and averse to the natural expression and discussion of people's emotions? Further research into the virus, how to defend, how to respond, how to better deploy supplies, how to better protect people, are practical issues, and technical issues should allow for feedback and discussion, how else can you improve it? When a policy is enacted, it can affect many people's lives, even if it is a matter of life or death. Why shouldn't the people affected be able to talk about their difficulties?

After reading hundreds of help-seeking Posts and feedback from family members, perhaps I can address some of the issues that remain.

After the closure of the city, transportation posed a great challenge to patients seeking treatment. Many families do not have cars, and the children of some elderly people may not be able to return because of the closure of the city. Several family members reported that they could not find a car to take them, and their elderly parents had to drag their sick bodies between the hospital and home in the cold wind. Still have old person by 120 take to the hospital to do a test, finish an examination to have no car to go home, can sit in the hospital hall till Dawn. There are women who give birth and don't have a car to go home. If the family member wants to send some urgent goods to the relatives in hospital, also must ask the person everywhere. Even if there was a community car, but because of the lack of first aid equipment in the car, a patient who was finally admitted to treatment died on the way to the hospital.

More generally, it's a long wait. Even if a CT scan shows a severe lung infection, a positive nucleic acid test is often necessary to gain admission. UNDIAGNOSED patients have difficulty getting a bed and have to wait in line for the next unknown test result. "My mom is finally in the hospital, but I know she's not coming back, " one family member said in a patient exchange group. Another family member said bitterly that his family has not been hospitalized so far and is he just waiting to die? She photographed a strange old man who had just died in a hospital hallway, and relatives of the old man wept over the body wearing a mask. At the end of the pneumonia, the person often dies from respiratory failure, unable to satisfy his or her physical needs by inhaling hard and in agony. Many people die with their mouths open, just like the old man in the photo, while their families watch them die.

While many patients struggle to survive, others are begging to die. A terminal cancer patient had to go home immediately after his hospital had been requisitioned. The patient does not have much time, every day is very torturous, the family member seeks the deathbed nursing, only hoped that the family member can be less painful to die. I suddenly realized that in this battle, it was also a luxury to want to die peacefully.

During admission, there were also cases of complex procedures, bodies playing tricks on each other and other patients being ignored. After a patient in hospital lost contact, family members can only in the group anxiously looking for patients with the same hospital, inquire about the status of family members. Some communities, hospitals blame each other, the community to their families to contact the hospital to find a bed, the hospital said there must be a referral list from the community, the community also replied that did not hear to write a referral list, the family can only make phone calls everywhere, back and forth. Some nurses with out-of-town Hukou had nowhere to stay when they became ill and had to sleep on the streets. Patients in need of intubation, dialysis and radiotherapy are dying because hospitals are being requisitioned and doctors are being transferred. We've seen several cases of people dying because they didn't get dialysis.

I know that for some people whose lives are not in danger, it is not difficult to say that, given the severity of the situation, the shortage of medical resources, "Some sacrifices are inevitable, " "we have to think about the big picture, " "we have to think about maximizing benefits. ". But a person is not a chess piece or a screw, every life has the qualification to live. After seeing what happened to so many patients, I was afraid that my loved ones and myself would one day become the ones who had to be sacrificed in the grand scheme of things, and more afraid that no one would speak up for us.

In this disaster, it is the health care workers pay, ordinary people keep watch over each other so that our society will not collapse in faith, plunged into darkness. However, these heartwarming, heartwarming moments should not cancel out our reflections on the problem. Any whitewashing, glorification, or chicken soup would be tantamount to second-guessing those who cry in distress. What they need is reflection, accountability, justice and improvement.

A friend who is also a volunteer told me that she was ashamed of having helped so many patients get admitted to hospital. ME, too. So many people asking for help, so many people in need of medical help, it may be a matter of hours, but there are only so many beds, and there are always some people who can not get help in time. A volunteer called to check, and the family members wept, saying that two of the family's octogenarians were dying and were just waiting to die. After I put down the phone, my friend asked me, this situation can be expedited? I felt my heart break. But I knew that even if I did, the elderly would probably give way to the young.

But who are we, mere mortals, to screen for human life? Those moments of comparison in the list showed me the deep cogs between destiny and destiny. I know that something inside of me has been changed forever, that there will never be joy without a shadow, that there will never be forgetfulness at my desk.

Sleepless Nights, I often hug the child, kiss his warm head, feel his body temperature. The thought of someone who would never be able to hold their child, someone who would never have a parent, and the weight of knowing that they were a survivor. I am not alive because I am smarter, harder working, and kinder than the dead, but because I am lucky. But I may not always be lucky.

I wish the time would go by quickly, but it is unbearable to think of the suffering of the dead, of the desperate, slowly forgotten, restored to peace as if nothing had happened.

I'm writing this in between volunteer work, but because I'm also a coward and a selfish person. I hope that when I or my relatives and friends, compatriots in any region above the country, in not so fortunate, can also be more perfect security. We, the survivors, must write and run for those who have died, and tell their stories aloud; for if we do not, the suffering will one day fall upon US unaltered.

Finally, as a volunteer, I would like to summarize some of the ways in which enthusiastic online users can better help those in need:

1. When you see the help-seeking information, click on the help-seeking person's latest status or comments below the post to see if they (or netizens) have reported the information to the People's Daily, Chutian metropolis daily, Xiake Island and other channels;

2. If not, help them fill out the help form. Many of them may not be able to use Weibo or Douban. After filling out the form, please write "submitted" in the comments so that the volunteer does not collect information repeatedly

3. Don't bombard them with text messages and phone calls when you can't clearly offer help, draining their energy and battery. They may be too sick to talk, or they may be waiting for information from a volunteer or community.

4. If you see that people don't know the hospital or the information, you can tell them by TWEETING@NCP  life support, or you can share the hospital bed information:
https://shimo.im/sheets/hPg9t9xT6GtkC3p8/MODOC
The content of this form is up to date and comprehensive. The only drawback is that it is not very convenient to view on your mobile phone.

If all else fails, don't beat yourself up. It's also important to love yourself and those around you as much as possible.

Since the outbreak began in early January, I haven't slept well, even though I'm 10,000 miles away in the United States. My husband studied in Wuhan, where we have a common good memory, never thought the mind of Spring Cherry and hot and dry surface of Wuhan will be associated with "pneumonia" , "epidemic" these two words.

Walking down the sunlit boulevards and sitting in the spacious library collecting information for help, I often feel trapped in a schizophrenic dream. The spring is deep here and the clouds are gloomy there.

Even though the volunteers had collected a lot of help posts during the day, I could still see a dozen new ones in the early hours of the morning. Those rescues are heartbreaking, and so humble: "My grandfather is dead, my grandmother is dying, please help us, " "my husband is only thirty-five, help this family! " "We have three people infected, we can only hope to send dad to the hospital first. " "sorry to use public resources, I really tried everything. "I learned that in Wuhan they call my grandmother 'home' , unfortunately, the way I know the word is by asking for help: "GRANDPA is dead, my family is very ill, I don't want to lose my family again!

After exchanging messages in private, she thanked me and gently told me to get some rest, too. In a short exchange, she gave me more warmth than I could ever give her. A few days later, I sneaked back to her page and saw that her family had been hospitalized and she was still fighting the virus herself.

Another day, a netizen posts a appeal for help, the elder dies a few days, the body has not been transported away.

" I tried to tell her that no one should be ashamed to live sorry, to gain basic rights, only to reply clumsily: "No one should have to go through this. "

In the face of their pain, any language seems powerless, Pale.

In this half month, the most let my heart is always the old people.

When collecting help information from microblogs, many netizens want to "tell the truth frankly" , advising bloggers that the elderly are too old to be saved, which is a waste of medical resources, as well as those who say "it's better to be euthanized" . There are older people who are less likely to use micro-blog pictures, did not post medical bills, was besieged by netizens "rumors" , "No map on the report.

Another blogger suggested "sacrificing this generation of old people" to "preserve the generations to come" . My anger had turned into a deep well of pain, for in reality, the old had been the first to be sacrificed. Late at night a few days ago, a group of people sent for help. More than 30 old people who should have been sent to the shelter were rejected because they were too old. They were dragged near the railway station to lay down and freeze in the cold wind. Volunteers in different groups immediately began to look for a car to pick up, call contact, report the status of the elderly in the group again and again, finally at 1:30 in the morning to all the elderly home.

These old men are not alone. When the mandatory criteria required all confirmed patients to be admitted, there were elderly people who could not care for themselves at the isolation point and were not given medication and their condition worsened; there were elderly people who were sent home from the isolation point and had their families contact the bed themselves. Frustrated, the volunteers who were eventually admitted to the hospital or placed in isolation soon received several tearful family members complaining that the patient had been left unattended, without medication, and was getting sicker. However, as long as the patient is sent to the isolation point is not "untreated" , volunteers can not help. I didn't dare to think deeply, suspecting that I was also involved in creating their situation, fearing that what I called "help" was merely pushing the person in need into another abyss.

I was thrilled when we opened up new lines of care that would allow us to move some of our critically ill patients faster. I had just added the name of a person who asked for help on Wechat. Her name, which is the same as my friend's, made me feel very familiar. Ask The age, the original aunt more than 50, in their 70 or 80-year-old parents for help, filled out all the forms can be filled, but the parents have not been admitted, the illness has been very difficult to wait. I immediately asked my aunt for her medical records again, telling her firmly that I would report it. Did Not expect to fill out the form, the declaration of the rules will be updated: mainly to accept patients under 60 years of age, the elderly or other patients do not include the same wait, all back to square one. But most of the people on this list who are in critical condition are elderly. Waiting, in a way, means waiting to die. I felt guilty, I felt like I had let my aunt down, and I was afraid that telling her would make her more desperate. Every day since then, I've been sneaking in to see how she's doing, afraid of bad news. Fortunately, the day before yesterday, my aunt's mother finally admitted to the hospital, I was a little relieved.

The elderly are lucky to have relatives and children to help set things up. Many elderly people living alone, unattended, once sick, even there may be no chance of rescue, by the time the information of illness outside the world was known, already dying.

At a time when the number of infections is so large, I understand that the majority of the elderly have underlying diseases, that infections are dangerous, that young people are more likely to survive treatment, and that medical resources are in short supply. But while microblogs praise retirees and poor elderly people for donating their life savings, the elderly are the last to be considered. If we can not take into account the needs of the weakest in society, at least we can not rationalize this neglect. An elderly man plunged into despair -- as if his death sent the message to several volunteer groups, all of whom wanted to help his wife. She was sixty-eight and was admitted shortly after his death. Everyone should be ashamed of the society that makes the elderly pay such a terrible price for their families'beds.

The reason why some netizens can say "give up old people" confidently, but because our society is running according to this logic. This Social Darwin logic drains everyone, cuts off empathy and mutual aid, and ruthlessly abandons useless tools, even to the point of shame. But the young will eventually become the old, then how do we go into their own night?

Maybe we can give up old people for generations to come, but that kind of reproduction, cold death, but is the Zombie replacement iteration.

On the evening of June 6th, after the death of Dr Li, a wave of grief broke out on the Internet. Early in the morning to see the message, I have long backlog of sadness also burst out, crying for a long time. However, before dawn, the voice urged everyone not to "fan the wind and light the fire, " "make use of the issue, " to "rational view, " for Dr. Lee is in the end the "whistle-blower" debate, which is very sad.

Isn't the point to reflect on why Dr. Lee was admonished, how to avoid the next Dr. Lee, and how to contain the epidemic in a more timely manner? Why are we so afraid of and averse to the natural expression and discussion of people's emotions? Further research into the virus, how to defend, how to respond, how to better deploy supplies, how to better protect people, are practical issues, and technical issues should allow for feedback and discussion, how else can you improve it? When a policy is enacted, it can affect many people's lives, even if it is a matter of life or death. Why shouldn't the people affected be able to talk about their difficulties?

After reading hundreds of help-seeking Posts and feedback from family members, perhaps I can address some of the issues that remain.

After the closure of the city, transportation posed a great challenge to patients seeking treatment. Many families do not have cars, and the children of some elderly people may not be able to return because of the closure of the city. Several family members reported that they could not find a car to take them, and their elderly parents had to drag their sick bodies between the hospital and home in the cold wind. Still have old person by 120 take to the hospital to do a test, finish an examination to have no car to go home, can sit in the hospital hall till Dawn. There are women who give birth and don't have a car to go home. If the family member wants to send some urgent goods to the relatives in hospital, also must ask the person everywhere. Even if there was a community car, but because of the lack of first aid equipment in the car, a patient who was finally admitted to treatment died on the way to the hospital.

More generally, it's a long wait. Even if a CT scan shows a severe lung infection, a positive nucleic acid test is often necessary to gain admission. UNDIAGNOSED patients have difficulty getting a bed and have to wait in line for the next unknown test result. "My mom is finally in the hospital, but I know she's not coming back, " one family member said in a patient exchange group. Another family member said bitterly that his family has not been hospitalized so far and is he just waiting to die? She photographed a strange old man who had just died in a hospital hallway, and relatives of the old man wept over the body wearing a mask. At the end of the pneumonia, the person often dies from respiratory failure, unable to satisfy his or her physical needs by inhaling hard and in agony. Many people die with their mouths open, just like the old man in the photo, while their families watch them die.

While many patients struggle to survive, others are begging to die. A terminal cancer patient had to go home immediately after his hospital had been requisitioned. The patient does not have much time, every day is very torturous, the family member seeks the deathbed nursing, only hoped that the family member can be less painful to die. I suddenly realized that in this battle, it was also a luxury to want to die peacefully.

During admission, there were also cases of complex procedures, bodies playing tricks on each other and other patients being ignored. After a patient in hospital lost contact, family members can only in the group anxiously looking for patients with the same hospital, inquire about the status of family members. Some communities, hospitals blame each other, the community to their families to contact the hospital to find a bed, the hospital said there must be a referral list from the community, the community also replied that did not hear to write a referral list, the family can only make phone calls everywhere, back and forth. Some nurses with out-of-town Hukou had nowhere to stay when they became ill and had to sleep on the streets. Patients in need of intubation, dialysis and radiotherapy are dying because hospitals are being requisitioned and doctors are being transferred. We've seen several cases of people dying because they didn't get dialysis.

I know that for some people whose lives are not in danger, it is not difficult to say that, given the severity of the situation, the shortage of medical resources, "Some sacrifices are inevitable, " "we have to think about the big picture, " "we have to think about maximizing benefits. ". But a person is not a chess piece or a screw, every life has the qualification to live. After seeing what happened to so many patients, I was afraid that my loved ones and myself would one day become the ones who had to be sacrificed in the grand scheme of things, and more afraid that no one would speak up for us.

In this disaster, it is the health care workers pay, ordinary people keep watch over each other so that our society will not collapse in faith, plunged into darkness. However, these heartwarming, heartwarming moments should not cancel out our reflections on the problem. Any whitewashing, glorification, or chicken soup would be tantamount to second-guessing those who cry in distress. What they need is reflection, accountability, justice and improvement.

A friend who is also a volunteer told me that she was ashamed of having helped so many patients get admitted to hospital. ME, too. So many people asking for help, so many people in need of medical help, it may be a matter of hours, but there are only so many beds, and there are always some people who can not get help in time. A volunteer called to check, and the family members wept, saying that two of the family's octogenarians were dying and were just waiting to die. After I put down the phone, my friend asked me, this situation can be expedited? I felt my heart break. But I knew that even if I did, the elderly would probably give way to the young.

But who are we, mere mortals, to screen for human life? Those moments of comparison in the list showed me the deep cogs between destiny and destiny. I know that something inside of me has been changed forever, that there will never be joy without a shadow, that there will never be forgetfulness at my desk.

Sleepless Nights, I often hug the child, kiss his warm head, feel his body temperature. The thought of someone who would never be able to hold their child, someone who would never have a parent, and the weight of knowing that they were a survivor. I am not alive because I am smarter, harder working, and kinder than the dead, but because I am lucky. But I may not always be lucky.

I wish the time would go by quickly, but it is unbearable to think of the suffering of the dead, of the desperate, slowly forgotten, restored to peace as if nothing had happened.

I'm writing this in between volunteer work, but because I'm also a coward and a selfish person. I hope that when I or my relatives and friends, compatriots in any region above the country, in not so fortunate, can also be more perfect security. We, the survivors, must write and run for those who have died, and tell their stories aloud; for if we do not, the suffering will one day fall upon US unaltered.

Finally, as a volunteer, I would like to summarize some of the ways in which enthusiastic online users can better help those in need:

1. When you see the help-seeking information, click on the help-seeking person's latest status or comments below the post to see if they (or netizens) have reported the information to the People's Daily, Chutian metropolis daily, Xiake Island and other channels;

2. If not, help them fill out the help form. Many of them may not be able to use Weibo or Douban. After filling out the form, please write "submitted" in the comments so that the volunteer does not collect information repeatedly

3. Don't bombard them with text messages and phone calls when you can't clearly offer help, draining their energy and battery. They may be too sick to talk, or they may be waiting for information from a volunteer or community.

4. If you see that people don't know the hospital or the information, you can tell them by TWEETING@NCP  life support, or you can share the hospital bed information:

The content of this form is up to date and comprehensive. The only drawback is that it is not very convenient to view on your mobile phone.

If all else fails, don't beat yourself up. It's also important to love yourself and those around you as much as possible.
