Seventeen years after the SARS epidemic, COVID-19 pneumonia is once again posing a serious challenge to China's and the global epidemic prevention system. Despite the effective medical control of the known infectious disease in the 20th century, new infectious diseases are still a major threat in the 21st century, as emphasized by the World Health Organization. What are the challenges posed by new infectious diseases? What challenges do the world's ubiquitous supercities pose for pandemic preparedness? How can health systems, societies and individuals respond?

Liu Shiyong is an expert in medical history, a distinguished professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and a visiting professor at the Center for Asian Studies at the University of Pittsburgh

COVID-19: According to the published data, the mortality rate from pneumonia is not very high compared to some malignant infectious diseases. Some experts also pointed out that the majority of patients with mild illness. However, the new crown disease still brought great fear and anxiety to people. How to understand this emotion from the perspective of Medical History?

Liu Shiyong: Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron, which depicts a group of men and women who flee to rural areas to escape the epidemic, attributes the epidemic to class conflict and religious corruption, reflecting humanity's instinctive reaction to blame others for unknown diseases. Before and after the closure of Wuhan, some residents "fled" to avoid the plague, and the outside world avoided those from Wuhan, is the "Decameron" modern version, projecting the human nature when faced with unknown threats instinctive response. Since fear is a human instinct in the face of the unknown, epidemic prevention has to take this into account and reduce its possible negative effects.

The most important thing to do to dispel this fear is to turn the unknown into the known, or at least the predictable. There are some lessons to be learned from the history of human influenza: The Spanish flu of 1918 was transmitted in an unknown and novel manner. Since 1960s, however, knowledge of influenza viruses and mutations has increased, and disease statistics have become more accurate, allowing epidemiologists to estimate the duration and characteristics of epidemics before 3 or 4 valent vaccines are available at different rates each year. The typical case is the variant B flu, which has killed more people than new pneumonia and is estimated to have caused nearly 6,000 related deaths since the winter of 2019, but has not caused public alarm, the reason is that influenza is generally considered to be a "known" and "manageable" epidemic.

In the face of new coronavirus pneumonia, human beings have no historical basis for analysis, and many speculations can only be compared with the different SARS experience except for the calculation based on the biological characteristics of the virus itself. This normal uncertainty of scientific argumentation, coupled with the SARS shadow in society was aroused, the public, and even the government, the inevitable fear of the unknown.

Sanlian Life Weekly: You have a point of view, before the 1850s, epidemic prevention work often rely on "clean" and "quarantine" two major work, the focus is to find and quarantine patients. By the second half of the 19th century, the establishment of a pathological relationship between bacteria and outbreaks had shifted the focus of epidemic prevention policy from isolating patients to preventing the spread of pathogens. Specifically, how has this shift in understanding and perception changed epidemic prevention practice?

Liu Shiyong: There are many examples of this, the most common is the change of quarantine regulations and behavior.

Specifically, how has this shift in understanding and perception changed epidemic prevention practice?

Liu Shiyong: There are many examples of this, the most common is the change of quarantine regulations and behavior.

In East Asia, in 1886, there was a national cholera epidemic in Japan. The Health Bureau of the Ministry of the Interior has introduced an extremely strict quarantine and regional blockade system into the capital, forcing residents to be quarantined or even relocated. Before the Second World War, when passengers were sick with Official infectious or ships from affected areas, leprosy, for example, had to be quarantined without proper health certificates. In the early years of the Republic of China, even Guangdong and Guangxi, there were also terrorist cases of mass shooting or burying suspected lepers alive. But with the confirmation of the biological characteristics and pathogenesis of M. Leprae and the development of effective drugs, people can develop and implement home-based treatment based on these knowledge. After the 1970s, the existing absolute isolation regulations, and even the corresponding establishment of Leper village, Leper House, gradually faded out of the isolation medical model, and into the mainstream of home and outpatient treatment model. There are many such examples.

With the identification of the pathogen, a clear vector of infection, and the invention of rapid reagents, most Official infectious went from 14 days of strict quarantine to self quarantine and home care; that's because the focus shifted to eradication, not The sick ones.

It is worth mentioning that in the past, before the emergence of effective drugs, isolation is not as good as the outside world imagined treatment and placement, which is more implicit in the "sit and wait for death, do not cause harm to others. ". The Isolation Hospital with active treatment and care has been around since 1970, and this is the beginning of home self-isolation. Therefore, the identification of pathogens and effective treatment are the key technical basis for changing this mode of epidemic prevention.

Sanlian Life Weekly: but in the face of new infectious diseases, we still returned to the "clean" and "quarantine" model, even, we adopted the "closed city. We note that this approach is not without controversy.

Liu Shiyong: it has become an important thinking logic in preventive medicine, especially in vaccines, immunoprophylaxis or treatment, to find out the pathogen and eliminate it, but such preventive measures are basically based on scientific medicine can be found in a timely manner and understand the basis of pathogenic bacteria. If the pathogen is unknown, how can it be effectively prevented or even treated? In the past, bacterial infections such as cholera, plague, or general parasitosis could be brought under control if microbiologists could understand the bacteria that cause them, this enables physicians and drug inventors to develop appropriate drugs for prevention, testing, and treatment. But the process took nearly a century.

In the past, bacterial infections such as cholera, plague, or general parasitosis could be brought under control if microbiologists could understand the bacteria that cause them, this enables physicians and drug inventors to develop appropriate drugs for prevention, testing, and treatment. But the process took nearly a century.

In 1910-1911, when the plague broke out in the northeast, laboratory tests required 7-10 days of bacterial culture. The problem was that, according to later medical historians, the 1911 pneumonic plague had an infection rate of R0 above 7. To put it simply, one person could infect about 7 people, so the 7 day test window was used to calculate that the outbreak had spread! In addition, in the antibiotic-free era, plague patients can only use support treatment, once the nutrition, medical treatment, of course, the case mortality rate will increase much. The sudden rise in the number of deaths and the mortality rate has inevitably caused a new wave of panic.

But in recent years, in several isolated outbreaks of plague, such as the one in northern India in 1992, doctors have been able to treat it with known methods and drugs, even when the cause is unknown and there are no antibiotics, the average number of days is more than five with the current standard supportive care alone. Modern plague detection technology only 3-5 days to identify and control plague bacteria, the medical community can be considered a serious plague in the past to control the situation within a certain range.

We are now faced with a situation in which medicine in the 20th century effectively controlled what was known as infectious disease, and since 1980 humans have shifted their focus to old age and genetic disorder diseases such as Alzheimer's, cancer, or Parkinson's disease. The SARS outbreak in 2003 was a wake-up call to a wave of near-century-old optimism about modern medicine, followed by avian influenza (H5N1) , Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (Mers) and even the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) , world Health Organization emphasizes that New Infectious Diseases are the 21st Century's disease killer. Understanding of coronaviruses in recent decades has made them difficult to detect clinically once they have invaded the human body, it also takes a considerable amount of time for the medical community to discover and understand its pathological features. Since 2003, only about 6-7 coronaviruses that cause human disease have been identified.

Tri-union Life Weekly: Today we are "quarantined" in the face of a new epidemic and face a new problem —— a modern city. Wuhan is a megalopolis, and there are many megacities in the world now. What are their challenges to epidemic prevention? Do Health experts still disagree on how to effectively prevent urban epidemics?
Liu Shiyong: First of all, this question involves how modern epidemiology carries on the quarantine and the epidemic prevention. In bacteriology thinking, once identified pathogens, according to its pathogenesis, transmission characteristics of quarantine and anti-blocking, or even treatment. These basic principles are as relevant in the case of viral infections as they are in the case of viral infections, but because the underlying logic of viral illness is still quite different from that of bacteria, their effects are sometimes more difficult to identify and predict. If people demand viral diseases based on optimism about the control of bacterial diseases in the past, an overconfident attitude can lead to excessive disappointment and fear.

From an epidemiological point of view, the outbreak of a severe cholera epidemic in 1854, London, England, is a precursor to modern public health. In this case, the physician John Snow found that the source of cholera infection is not the air, but contaminated water. The finding has influenced modern public health thinking since the 19th century and prompted governments to improve sanitation. Later, "epidemic centers" (epic) were defined as places that are conducive to the spread of infection. To be clear, Dr. Snowe is not a pioneer in bacteriology, but disease statistics and the spatial distribution of cases suggest that each is associated with a common tap. Snowe relied not so much on bacteriology as on statistics and observation.

Wuhan is classified as the focus of the epidemic, is this kind of thinking, analysis under the product. But relatively speaking, whether the detection of pathogens or statistical identification of behavioral Foci, there is a need for a large number of historical data as a basis. Faced with the new epidemic, epidemic prevention experts are facing an unknown and dynamic development of the epidemic. The scientific ignorance and ignorance represented by the "new type" , coupled with modern transportation and the environment of clustered cities, make it more difficult to identify the risk of bacterial mutation and behavioral transmission. Megacity is now ubiquitous from Tokyo to Shanghai. It is modern transportation and communication systems that sustain these megacities. Rapid transport is also a pipeline for the rapid circulation of pathogens, and a highly concentrated population is a hotbed for bacterial variation and cross-infection.

The traditional isolation method became the prototype of community isolation and closure when SARS appeared in the community. This was happening all over the world. But since 2007, more and more studies have found that many urban public sewers, sewage ducts, and even the lack of distance between homes, in fact, make the traditional isolation of the community ineffective. Therefore, some scholars believe that the decline of SARS epidemic, I am afraid that climate factors and the decay of the virus itself has a greater relationship.

So the new question is, what should be the basic unit of community segregation? Traditional thinking about residential segregation in population-based villages is inadequate. Is it based on public transportation and pipelines? I'm afraid that's not good enough. In Shanghai, for example, I have calculated that the average commuting distance in 1930s is 3.8 kilometers, and the average household has a water withdrawal radius of less than one kilometer. Now this distance is more than two subway stations and public water pipes, once the infected people carry out daily movement or the spread of contaminated water sources, the impact is bound to exceed the surface of the administrative zoning and community area. Therefore, regional control of epidemic prevention for residents along the Suzhou Creek and Huangpu Rivers at that time, or even the isolation of water sources in certain areas, was effective in epidemic prevention; such a modern approach is clearly not effective. In addition, the SARS period of Hong Kong community closed study, residential buildings common ventilation, public sewage pipes have been detected virus, become one of the reasons why the first floor block ineffective.

Sanlian Life Weekly: So now in the international response to Metropolitan Epidemic Prevention, what are the common practices? What's the focus?

Liu Shiyong: The current discussion on epidemic prevention is always thinking in the mode of war preparedness. To clarify the point is that "quarantine" is mainly preventive, and "Epidemic Prevention" is to pay attention to the outbreak of the enemy after the first opportunity. As far as I know, the United States has a basic model of wartime vaccination, drawing broadly on the experience of past gas wars and the concept of CBRN defense, which requires vaccination to be treated as a combat. Current CDC quarantine and epidemic prevention norms have also been transferred to overseas battlefields and returning military personnel, and even NASA astronauts. The details are so convoluted that references to the 1999 movie Virus and 2011's Infections both reveal sections of the process in action. Japan has a model for dealing with a downward-facing earthquake in the Guandong region, and there is some thinking about regional epidemic prevention. In addition to considering hardware construction, these considerations also focus on a great deal of basic data about its urban operating model and the movement of its urban population. These regular data are the key to the effectiveness and accuracy of emergency measures. This is not so much the study of viruses in preventive medicine as it is the understanding and application of social behavior, demography, and even the history of medicine and disease.

How to expand the collection of necessary information, strengthen the public's trust in official statistics, and even speed up the response time of epidemic prevention (rather than relying solely on the time of medical examination) , has Been The focus of public health debate for the past 20 years.

Sanlian Life Weekly: What do you think of the significance and function of Wuhan "Fengcheng" ?

Liu Shiyong: The city closure of Wuhan has an unprecedented significance of modern epidemic prevention experiments. We can examine it in the future to see if it is possible to deal with the spread of disease in large cities in the same way that traditional transport barriers and regional isolation have been used. It is difficult not to consider whether the traditional zoning blockade, as mentioned earlier, should be expanded to cover the whole city during the SARS epidemic. Moreover, although the relationship between the new pneumonia and the Spring Festival travel has not yet seen specific research, but the speed of domestic high-speed rail, the current convenience of self-drive, people have to consider the problem of accelerating proliferation, thus the establishment of a choke point (closure) is also an option.

At present, the effect of the blockade and the impact of the initial. From a relatively good point of view, Wuhan as the main focus of the image established, is conducive to the surrounding area and the country to do effective prevention of blockage. But from a global point of view, there are other problems. The medical diagnosis of NCP is mainly through the detection of virus nucleic acid, but which suspected cases need to be taken for examination are related to the standard of "suspected cases" set by the health authorities of various countries and regions.

The Taiwan region had previously used a 14-day history of travel or residence in mainland China as an epidemiological condition. Only those cases that meet the epidemiological criteria and have specific clinical symptoms will be tested for new coronavirus infection. If only 14 days ago to Japan or Thailand, such as travel, after returning to the flu-like symptoms of patients, generally only as a flu treatment institutions.

Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia and other places have adopted a similar approach. But some European countries, such as the UK, regard the travel history of Thailand, Japan and others as possible cases that need to be checked further. This difference is related to the results of different assessments of epidemic risks in other countries by national epidemic prevention and health authorities, and may also be related to the consideration of the total number of tourist population and their respective epidemic prevention capacity, but it may also affect the proportion of "confirmed cases" being "found" , or even inadvertently conceal the possibility of community-acquired NCP.

The key, perhaps, is that the WHO does not seem to have uniform criteria for how countries define suspected cases when it counts national epidemics. In this case of clinical suspected cases of new crown pneumonia classification, specific cities, countries, and even regions, will become a "point" in the thinking of the global epidemic network, and each to consider whether to block. Similar considerations apply to the disruption of air travel to China that many countries announced after February.

The World Health Organization emphasizes that New Infectious Diseases are the great enemies of epidemic prevention in the 21st century. In the face of this great enemy, what lessons do we still need to make up?

Liu: We need to re-examine our public health system. In terms of past public health achievements in Taiwan and the mainland, there are many similarities. From 1950 to 1970s, the public health systems on both sides of the Taiwan Strait were on the verge of becoming like a disease -- an epidemic -- but with great success. Cholera, dysentery, malaria, Japanese Encephalitis, tuberculosis, polio and other infectious diseases disappeared or were under control in Taiwan, while sexually transmitted diseases were successfully eradicated in the mainland, control Plague, malaria, Schistosomiasis, cholera, smallpox, diphtheria, tuberculosis and other diseases.

In the first 30 years of the People's Republic of China, the public health system followed the principle of "prevention first, medical treatment second" , while in Taiwan, "prevention is better than cure" was the supreme guideline. But later, the principle of giving priority to medical treatment and giving priority to prevention gradually dominated the trend of public health policies on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. In the past few decades, the public health systems on both sides of the Straits have all experienced the medicalization, commercialization, marketization and expansion of the public health system, the public health system is thus severely weakened, while society and government are more focused on medicine or medical prevention and treatment itself.

I would like to emphasize that the center of gravity of Public Health has always been to guard against the unknown and prepare for war in peacetime. And Preventive Medicine is to annihilate the enemy needs to be clear, or to prevent the occurrence of a plague, the two think quite different. The modern version of public health and epidemic prevention should not only be a reference or prescription of preventive medicine, but also involve education, behavior and even health culture.

Remember when SARS just disappeared, Secretary World Health Organization called on the world from the "epidemic" , to learn from the face of unknown infectious diseases should be the basic health habits and attitudes. But from 2003 to the current new pneumonia, the general public and the government will probably still deal with it in the face of the control of old infectious diseases, such as now placing their hopes on the market for new drugs to treat pneumonia, all this oversimplifies the complexity and time-consuming process of drug development and virus testing. Many folk practices also highlight a group of people can not distinguish between air infection, droplet infection, and the gap between contact infection. We also need to achieve health modernity.

Sanlian Life Weekly: How to understand the modernity of health?

Liu Shiyong: health modernization and health modernity are two groups of subjects. The former involves system, education, and social discipline, while the latter focuses on self-regulation, people and government consciousness.

For example, after China became rich, the middle class attached great importance to health preservation, so the traditional and folk ways of keeping in good health came out. Eating Venison is obviously not a western concept of health, but it may be in line with the traditional Chinese health preservation law. But personal hygiene is not necessarily a public health necessity. Early Japan, modern Russia and South Korea all had similar problems, but they gradually integrated traditional cleanliness with modern hygiene practices. The process of how to fuse is modernization, and the result of fuse is modernity.

Another example of a clash between traditional cultural values and public health is the Chinese emphasis on the value of hard work, the recognition of studying and going to work with an illness, and the taboo of preventing and controlling infectious diseases. When the Spanish flu hit in 1918, Japan -- a country with an emphasis on the value of hard work -- exploded more than six times as quickly as a national cluster of infections after school holidays, many of them at their source, from good students who don't want to Miss School. If the resumption of school work, we must do a good job protection measures.

There is another phenomenon of this epidemic. Chinese people, including Taiwan area and overseas Chinese, are similar. We wear masks to prevent epidemic diseases. We are afraid of inhaling germs. Therefore, we only wear masks when we are afraid of an outbreak. People's mentality is to have a mask on the protection of many, go out to walk all right. In the West, people wear masks to prevent self-transmission of germs, so it is a sign of medical advice or self-accountability. How did this awareness of modern hygiene come about?

In addition to the advancement of science and medicine, we also need to formulate modern health education, adjust the relationship between the individual body and the nation, and transform traditional social and cultural values. In short, public health is confronted not only with disease, but with the human factors that cause disease and infection.

In fact, each year during the Spring Festival travel and long holidays, returning home or back to school, work after some of the phenomenon of rising epidemic, in fact, these are predictable. How to learn from these historical data and experiences the necessity of self-management, and even the relevance of individual values to public interests and risks, is perhaps the most important thing we can do, a key link in the development of Health Modernity in China.
