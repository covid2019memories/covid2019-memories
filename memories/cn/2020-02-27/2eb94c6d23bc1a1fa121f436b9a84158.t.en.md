This number is extremely comfortable. I suggest you star it
In the outbreak of the epidemic, the advantage of market technology and efficiency filled the blind spot that the administrative power could not reach, and the administrative power then became the key element of overall direction. However, in the new stage, when the market economies themselves have more normalized demand, the administrative power to help the policy and one-size-fits-all constraints have formed a contradiction. After many rounds of top-down mobilization, bottom-up trade-offs, the pace of resumption is about some kind of balance.

From paying attention to the situation of fighting against the epidemic, to gazing at the "people" in the epidemic situation and their lives during the epidemic situation, to focusing on the "disaster situation" and the "full resumption of work" in all walks of life under the impact of the epidemic situation, the Chinese public opinion field during the period of fighting the epidemic situation, the expansion of core issues not only enriches the dimension of discussion, but also enlarges the threshold of influence of public opinion.

"Sansheng" (WECHAT PUBLIC ID: Tosansheng) once recorded in "Chinese public opinion field 3 during the anti-epidemic period" , when the focus of attention from the epidemic situation itself to focus on the epidemic "I" life, it means that "the immediate impact of the epidemic on every participant in public opinion is rising significantly" and "this matter is already everyone's business" .

Now the shift is happening again. The debate over the current state of economies under the impact of the epidemic continues to gain momentum. The discussion, whether focusing on the micro-life of individuals or the macro-economic context of the country, leads to a further strengthening of the social sentiment that "everyone is becoming a witness to the epidemic" . Along with this, with the coming of the resumption of construction, the discussion scene of "special period" is objectively shifting from "long vacation life" to the relatively abnormal daily work. The process of epidemic situation is deepening, the influence is deepening, and the discussion context is changing from "emergency time" to "new normal" .

This process has been accompanied by changes in the role of the commercial power as a subject in different times:

In the initial stage of anti-epidemic, the situation of epidemic situation is changing rapidly, and the measures of different enterprises to combat epidemic situation are focused on. Commercial power is one of many social forces responding to the epidemic.

Through the rapid release of information, the perspective of the report began to look at the epidemic affected the different individuals. This individual "natural person" to the "enterprise individual" . At this point, because of the epidemic and operating conditions are greatly affected, cash flow of a number of small and medium-sized enterprises become the leading role of public opinion ecology. Companies have gone from being the ones who fought the epidemic to being the victims of it.

With the coming of the resumption period and the public opinion fermentation, it calls for reducing the one-size-fits-all anti-epidemic control, and promotes the sound level of enterprises to resume work. People's focus on the enterprise, back to when the enterprise can assume its original role.

A hundred years ago, Lippmann wrote in the classic book of Public Opinion, Modern Society is so large and complex, so much so that we can only act on our mental picture of the world, a simulation of the world, woven together with all kinds of information. Public opinion is formed by the collection of the world's cognitive picture in the public mind. The field of public opinion and reality are always constructing and influencing each other.

A hundred years later, the same is true. The image of commercial power is constantly changing in the field of public opinion. Meanwhile, in the process of the continuous shaping of the face of commercial power, the huge tension formed by the combination of reality and public opinion field pushes each of us from a present occupied by epidemic situation, towards A pandemic-affected future.

01 | Mobilization and Response

January 20th is the cognitive origin of the whole people's anti-epidemic. In terms of social awareness, it was a public speech in Zhong Nanshan, while in terms of administrative awareness, it was the supreme leader's important instruction of the day on the outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia. Two lines are released from the mainstream media, "anti-epidemic" has become the main body of the community to release social mobilization.

On January 23rd, the city of Wuhan was sealed off. Wuhan is in a constant state of emergency. Helping Wuhan becomes the central task of the anti-epidemic work.

In the face of the still uncertain trend of the epidemic situation, some media have also written articles to analyze the tasks and challenges faced by Internet enterprises under the situation of fighting the epidemic situation, and summarize the enterprise's countermeasures. On January 22, Caijing published an article on its public account: "The internet fights the new pneumonia. ". The article concludes that in the area of medical supplies, masks are in short supply and prices are rising, and summarizes the announcements made by e-commerce platforms and upstream medical enterprises that do not allow price increases while announcing efforts to increase production. In the tourism sector, in the face of traffic, accommodation and other areas of a large number of unsubscribe, ctrip, flying pig, the same way elong almost all travel platform industry issued a notice of the security measures.

On January 23, Sansheng also published a report entitled "Commercial General Mobilization before and after the closure of the city" , which takes Wuhan as the central node and analyzes the relevant safeguards issued by the merchants before and after the closure of the city. In addition to taking stock of the protective measures against price increases, increasing the supply of masks and refunding tickets at preferential rates, issued by e-commerce and travel platforms before the closure of the city, sansheng also recorded the efforts made by enterprises to ensure the supply of daily life in Wuhan after the closure of the city. For example, in response to the shortage of materials for daily life in Wuhan, Wuhan Hema issued a public announcement that it would spare no efforts to ensure that prices would not be raised or closed.

However, before and after the closure of the city in the field of public opinion, the action of the business report and inventory is still less. For most of the media, the focus at this time is still on the rapid development of the epidemic form. At the same time, most of the enterprise's anti-epidemic measures are still in the declaration-based, concrete measures are in the initial stage.

On January 29, the The Economic Observer published a report, "Wuhan in the air, a relay race of enterprises fighting against the epidemic is going on. " In the form of a field interview with the enterprise back to the epidemic: the Article Interviewed Debon Express Management Staff Yan Dongfang. Under the leadership of chairman Cui Weixing, debang logistics immediately organized 47 emergency teams to transport disaster relief materials for the city of Wuhan using the company's own truck resources. The article also reported that on January 25, Cainiao Network, in conjunction with domestic and overseas logistics enterprises such as Zhongtong, Debang and AirCity, opened domestic and global green channels for the free transportation of donated relief materials from all over the world to the Wuhan area. On January 27, three SF planes brought in 70 tons of relief supplies for Wuhan.

At the same time, this paper also puts forward an important viewpoint on the phenomenon of efficient delivery of medical supplies by enterprises, "In Wuhan, the organisation is being deployed by the government to fill in the gaps where administrative power is hard to reach and to take on some of the responsibility for responding to the epidemic. They are generally more flexible and efficient than the administrative system and have more specialized equipment and technology reserves."

With this point of view cross-corroboration of a core public opinion hot spot is the people of Wuhan medical supplies shortage of concern. To January 23, a number of hospitals, including Wuchang Hospital and Wuhan Union Hospital, have posted on the Internet urgent requests for medical resources, asking for donations of safety products such as goggles and N95 face masks. Has Been widely discussed on the Internet.

On January 30, the "people of the day" report, "where are those medical supplies going? " , went a step further to address the crux of the medical supply problem: The supply side, it is inefficient to apply for approval at every level of the existing medical supply system: If there is an emergency response and the construction unit needs a mask, contact the government first, and the staff of the Government Emergency Response Office contact the Health Commission, health Council through a special department by the supplier layer to the factory. Factory production completed by the health and related departments to drive away contact follow-up transport. If resources are mobilized across provinces, there is a unified national deployment. The result was a huge material gap in Wuhan, severely testing the speed of administration. Official supplies will not arrive in time. "The speed of information exchange on the Internet, the ability to mobilize resources, coupled with the enthusiasm of citizens and action, may be faster than the administrative speed to run. "

Meanwhile, at the transportation level, both official relief supplies and social donations at home and abroad are also facing a shortage of transportation capacity, a doctor at Wuhan Puren Hospital responded to reporters after a call for help was sent, Sanlian Life Weekly reported in its investigative Article "Wuhan Medical Supplies: What can we do? " The hospital actually got a lot of calls about donations. Most of these calls, however, did not translate into effective relief because "supplies could not get in" .

Combined with the information presented by the public opinion field at that time, on the one hand, the basic information sharing platforms set up by the micro-blog, wechat and other communities successfully played the role of the aggregator of social donations; on the other hand, alibaba Jd.com and other e-commerce platform integration of medical production resources to speed up production, and Organization of Logistics Forces for distribution and a series of grasp, in the environment at the time reflected a very important value.

In addition to the transportation of goods and materials, we also found from the media's real-time reports that the commercial force also plays a role in other aspects of social mobilization, cooperating with the administrative force to make up for the absence of the administrative force.

On Jan. 24, Didi set up a "medical security team" of 100 drivers to connect with three hospitals in Wuhan to provide services to medical workers who had difficulty traveling during the city's closure due to the suspension of public transportation, the The Economic Observer reported. On January 25, the Beijing News, Nandu weekly and other media reported that the Wuhan Hotel Industry has organized to invite medical staff to stay nearby for free, and more than 235 Wuhan Hotels Receive Medical Staff for free.

In the case of the Red Cross in Hubei Province, which drew national attention in late January and early February, after it was revealed by almost all media that a large backlog of donated materials in Red Cross warehouses had been difficult to distribute to hospitals, on January 31, kyushu Medical Logistics Company officially assists Wuhan Red Cross in reloading supplies. A staff member at Kyushu Tong said emergency medical supplies could be delivered and distributed within two hours, according to a live Phoenix News report. At the same time, on February 3, the southern weekend also made a follow-up report on the distribution of materials after the arrival of Kyushu: "after foreign aid" assists the Wuhan Red Cross Society: Tally efficiency is improved, the distribution should listen to instructions" .

After the fact and Public Opinion Field Double Fermentation, the enterprise in the disaster relief technology and the efficiency superiority also gradually obtained the official affirmation and the response: February 10 news conference, chen Yueliang, director of the grass-roots Regime Building and Community Governance Department of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, called on Big Internet companies such as Alibaba tencent to develop community public software for community epidemic prevention workers and make it available to them. "A good cause is worth more than a billion dollars, " he said

Ali and tencent responded on Weibo, saying they were ready for Alibaba Cloud's response: Alibaba Cloud, together with alipay and nail, has launched a free smart community epidemic prevention and control program, can Help community front-line staff to complete the entry and exit registration, Health Punch card, epidemic notice and other work. TENCENT'S RESPONSE: Community Outbreak Management Tool Ready. February 8 tencent Haina Community Electronic Pass has been launched, all residents to declare health information, the realization of government departments to view the epidemic data.

02 | help yourself

When the time comes to the end of January, with the depth of media coverage and the gradual launch of anti-epidemic work, the focus of public opinion field from the focus on the situation to the epidemic of "people" concern. The fate of many small and micro enterprises has gradually attracted people's attention in the reports of visits to the subjects affected by the epidemic. The role of the entire business community in the public perception during the outbreak has gradually shifted from being a participant in the fight against the disease to being a risk taker.

The first industries to get attention are tourism and catering, two service industries that have lost large numbers of customers during the Spring Festival: January 31, the The Economic Observer article, "They in the stricken industry: Back to work for life, one hundred thousand per cent of monthly rent, and the policy of support in the hope" , reports on the plight of the couple, Bian Li, a tour guide, and kidney boy, who runs a barbecue restaurant in Chaoyang District. Similarly, burning finance and economics 240 hours to save yourself and him, a restaurant business, cAIXIN'S FOOD AND BEVERAGE INDUSTRY UNDER EPIDEMIC SITUATION: Hard to compress rental labor costs, high cash flow stress will be the food and beverage industry as the impact of the epidemic by the impact of the typical industry sample for analysis.

On Feb. 1, Jia Guolong, chairman of northwest naked face village, a large-scale chain restaurant, said in an interview with the China investment website that "the epidemic has left more than 20,000 employees unemployed, and their salaries can not last more than three months. ". "northwest naked oats village cash flow industry can not support three months. ". Large-scale catering enterprises in northwest naked face village for their own crisis of "self-exposure" further triggered a strong concern about the crisis of the catering industry.

In the field of industry, after a few days of Public Opinion Fermentation, focus on further expansion of the industry: The Economic Observer's February 4 report, "mother and baby shop closure caused by the industrial chain test: ready to endure for half a year, " the mother and baby industry as a perspective, it describes the dilemma faced by many manufacturing chains: "retail store suppliers are faced with stagnant returns due to terminal inactivity, and at the same time, money is pressed on the brand but can not get the goods, only to consume the inventory pressure; the brand side is carrying the burden of producing new goods can not come out, old goods can not circulate, but the cost is not a lot of burden a day. "

At the same time, in the field of venture capital, Zhu Xiaohu, Wang Ran, Wu Shichun and other investors to the venture investors and institutions gave almost the same advice: "strictly control costs, open source and save money, dead card cash flow. ". On the one hand, investment activities affected by the epidemic, the sharp decline in income. As investor Wang ran concluded in his speech, "Wang Ran: The impact of the current epidemic on start-up financing in the first half of the year, " "For all the financing that was originally planned to start after the festival, it is very likely that the actual external start-up due to the epidemic will not take place until March, and the completion of the transaction will almost certainly take until the second half of the year. ". At the same time, due to work stoppages, traffic control and other factors, new business is difficult to launch, income industry was greatly affected.

January 31st, the report, impact analysis and Policy Recommendations of the epidemic on the Chinese economy, published by Ren Zeping of the Evergrande Research Institute, systematizes the impact of the epidemic on the industry and the macro economic situation from a macro perspective: In the report, he analyzed, in medium-sized industries, the outbreak of food and beverage, tourism, film, transportation, education and training industries the biggest impact, medical, online games and other industries benefit. On the impact of micro-individuals, "production and business shutdown, income and cash flow disruption, but rent, wages, interest and other costs of rigid payments, enterprises will suffer huge losses. ". Disruption of operations may result in breach of contract and difficulty in capital turnover. Some small and medium-sized micro-, small-sized enterprises with weak anti-risk ability will face the predicament of bankruptcy and bankruptcy. Risks may also be transmitted up and down the supply chain and the guarantee chain as well as laterally, causing local crises.".

At the same time, macro-statistical data on the operating conditions of small and medium-sized enterprises also keep emerging. The data show that the situation is very grim: issued by china-europe Zhongchuang Platform, by Zhu Wuxiang, professor of the Department of Finance, School of Economics and management, Tsinghua University, in a survey of 995 small and medium sized enterprises, Liu Jun, general manager of Beijing Small and Micro Enterprises Comprehensive Financial Service Co. , and Wei Wei, a professor of management at Peking University's HSBC Business School, said: 85.1 per cent of smes indicated that the cash balance on their books could sustain them for less than three months. 29.58 per cent of businesses estimated that the epidemic had led to a decline in operating income of more than 50 per cent in 2020.

In the field of public opinion, the concern about the survival of smes has gradually become the mainstream. In the interaction between public opinion and reality, the two sides of the government and platform merchants have gradually introduced support policies for smes. On the one hand, real estate platforms such as Longhu District and Wanda have announced preferential rent policies, while Suzhou has also taken the lead in releasing the "Su 10" on February 4 to support small and micro enterprises in the city, some preferential methods, such as reducing or waiving rent and providing stable and low-interest loans, were put forward. At the same time, it also puts forward some measures to reduce the tax expense and social insurance expense of the employees for the small and medium-sized enterprises, so as to further reduce the amount of enterprise expenditure. For a period of time, various provinces, cities and platform businesses have issued protection policies for their small and medium-sized enterprises. Relevant financial media have summarized this: For example, protecting Small and medium-sized enterprises: A second front beyond epidemic prevention and control

At the same time, in the field of public opinion, business professionals such as Wu Xiaobo and Liang Xinjun have also expressed their views on ways for smes to save themselves: For example, the Public Channel Wu Xiaobo launched a series of "Go! Boss" live classes, 8 live-streaming sessions for SME owners on responding to the outbreak were recorded. On Feb. 21, Wu announced that it had completed four live online broadcasts, watched more than 10 million times, and received 59,987 applications.

Crises objectively open up new opportunities. Business links can deliver value as well as risk: in the marketplace, more and more of the emerging online economy is being reported and watched. And gradually led to the "home economy" heated discussion. Southern weekend published a report: "Fresh e-commerce "epidemic" outside the rise: reported the epidemic environment, such as daily excellent fresh e-commerce procurement and consumption of large growth. Sanlian life weekly has published a report entitled "The orgy of Boredom: Have you ever been to a disco? " Which tells the story of the popularity of the live-streaming disco music on Douyin. For the traditional online entertainment game field, the game media have been "the strongest hand Spring Festival file" describes the strong performance of hand tour.

In the online economy, online education and online work carry a lot of attention and expectation: Liang Xinjun pointed out in his open online course in Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business that it would "accelerate the growth" of both online education and online work, foster the maturity of the user and the supplier. The number of articles on both is enormous. However, judging from the trend of public opinion field, online and offline seems not so easy to split, there are still many problems to be solved.

Online education, February 10 to February 24, from the primary school to the university basically ushered in the "cloud open school" , social media often appear on the "teacher into the anchor" of the ridicule. But after the initial novelty wore off, some reports began to emerge about online education: on February 21st, after the publication on the Public Internet of Jianghu of the article "naked test, " online education was not "hot. " This paper analyzes the disadvantages of online education, such as poor conversion effect, difficulty of retention, and difficulty of online learning compared with offline teaching. And today, on public account, we published an article, "300 million students and teachers in the cloud: How to upgrade online education? " , which focuses on the difficulties encountered by teachers, parents and students in the new environment,

For the online office, in view of its inherent inefficiency and inapplicability, since February 10(Monday) large-scale resumption of Work Day, public opinion field on the "resumption of work matters needing attention" , "resumption of work tips" content is also significantly increased.

From the focus on the crisis, to discuss the future direction of the air, and then to the current offline appeal for guidance and response from the government. Business is gradually returning to normality and its original role.

However, for small and medium-sized enterprises, the crisis will still exist objectively for a long time. A brief boom in the online sector also depends on normalisation of the overall economic environment. For many industries of small and medium-sized enterprises, especially offline catering, tourism and other industries relying on offline flow, its consumption nature of irreplaceable can not be resolved objectively. In the ongoing impact of the epidemic, a large number of enterprises can not meet this temporary state, the need to ensure the smooth flow of cash on the one hand, while looking forward to the arrival of real normalcy soon.

03 | coordinates and balance

In the field of public opinion, while the whole people continue to strictly control the epidemic situation, a reflection on another phenomenon began to appear. On the one hand, the rate of case growth has objectively declined, on the other hand, the loss of too "one-size-fits-all" prevention and control measures is further seen through the media and social networks. In the field of public opinion, the Voice of public opinion calling for society to release itself from the wartime state of comprehensive prevention and control of epidemic situation began to appear obviously, and the viewpoint of taking care of epidemic prevention and economic life was gradually rising.

The phenomenon of one-size-fits-all and one-size-fits-all is embodied in the one-size-fits-all obstruction of the movement of people and materials by some grass-roots government departments, which has closed the located in the administrative territorial entity area mechanically. Such anti-epidemic measures, become imposed on the head of both the epidemic situation outside the apparent bondage.

As early as the end of January, the media to hard nuclear epidemic prevention in the NAME OF A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL EPIDEMIC PREVENTION MODEL TO BE REFLECTED:

On January 29, the Economic Information Daily published an editorial entitled "Epidemic Review | Upgrading Epidemic Prevention measures should not be carried out in a simple and crude "one-size-fits-all" . The article mentioned that, "Some local governments, especially grass-roots governments, have turned the epidemic prevention race into an all-out arms race. ". For example, the National Health and Welfare Commission has proposed that "entering the net and entering the family" should be the first line of defense for the prevention and control of the epidemic in the community; some local governments have arbitrarily upgraded epidemic prevention operations, acquiescing or encouraging village committees to dig roads to "close villages" or to affix slogans to "close households" , triggering discrimination and attacks against the returnees in Wuhan; and some county governments have issued red-headed documents prohibiting the entry of vehicles from Hubei, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Chongqing and other provinces, arousing antagonism between officials and residents in different provinces.

Once again, the individual became a point of reflection, and people published an investigative report, drifting on the highway, chronicling the story of freight driver Xiao Hongbing: As highways were closed everywhere, he could not enter the city for rest because his license plate was Hubei Province, so he drove on the highway for 4 days and 4 nights without interruption. Finally, he stayed in the service area in consultation with the traffic police.

Such "hard nuclear epidemic prevention" measures were originally designated for the most severe period of the epidemic in Hubei Province. However, with the resumption of work in various provinces on February 10 and the continuous reduction of new cases of the epidemic in areas outside Hubei, the strict control of some grass-roots "sports-style" has made the need for enterprises to resume work a castle in the air, which has led to growing opposition in the media.

On February 10, China News weekly published a report, "the first batch of enterprises to resume work is more than one-third difficult, small and medium-sized enterprises close to the red line of survival, " indicating that many enterprises because "migrant workers can not return to work, goods can not be delivered, simply can not start work. ".

Two days later, the policy signals from the China State Council Executive Meeting and the Standing Committee of the Politburo led to a series of articles on the "one size fits all" issue in the media field, it led to a series of policy changes.

In the China State Council executive meeting on February 12, requirements "to do a good job in various prevention and control work at the same time, in an orderly manner to promote the resumption of work and production, at the same time, clearly put forward "the main labor exports and imports to do a good job of migrant workers and other key groups back to work docking and services. ". We will correct the practice of "one-size-fits-all" persuading foreign vehicles and personnel to return

Subsequently, a press release issued by the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau also mentioned that non-epidemic prevention and control key areas should focus on the implementation of precise prevention and control by zoning, classification and control, and the overall planning of epidemic prevention and control and the restoration of economic and social order. According to the principle of scientific prevention and control, we should take the county as the unit, determine the risk level of different counties, and formulate the differentiated prevention and Control Strategy. Party committees and governments at all levels should do a good job in preventing and controlling the Seek truth from facts, correct biased and extreme practices in a timely manner, and do not simply close the door and shut it down, so as to minimize the impact of epidemic prevention and control on the production and livelihood of the people.

"co-ordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic and the restoration of economic and social order, " and rectify practices such as "one-size-fits-all" persuasion of foreign vehicles and personnel, which have become official administrative signals, it indicates that Chinese society is gradually beginning to release from the "wartime state" of fighting against epidemic disease in a comprehensive way.

Subsequently, the media for one-size-fits-all related reports continue to increase, calls for a full resumption of the voice gradually dominated the mainstream.

On February 13, "Zepin macro" released a related research report of the Evergrande Research Institute, "warning of the phenomenon of "one-size-fits-all, layer upon layer" in the prevention and control of epidemic situations in various places, " and directly named the "even with preferential policies, " But the current epidemic prevention and control system is still allowing enterprises to suffer a large number of losses. According to the report, the tight control of the epidemic has resulted in delays in the return of workers and the delivery of goods, as well as one-size-fits-all work stoppages still in use by many governments, causing a large number of service enterprises to suspend work and delay the resumption of work, although all kinds of supporting measures have been issued, but enterprises still need to pay for the loss of work stoppage, cash flow pressure increased sharply.

From Feb. 16, Hu Xijin, editor in chief of the Global Times, also issued a call to resume work on Weibo, a microblog service that said, "encouragement to return to work has also been shouted as a slogan, but many of the practical conditions for returning to work are still incomplete, or even lack the practical impetus for their rapid formation. For example, many places do not encourage workers from other places to return quickly, some units do not dare to let their employees go to work on a large scale, and local governments easily do not dare to encourage people to go out and spend on the basis of strengthening self-protection. No city dares to take the lead in restoring the normal state of society. "

In the interaction with the public opinion field, the pace of the resumption of work has been slowly pushed forward, a new round of local mobilization began: February 16, the first special train for migrant workers to resume work from Guiyang, Hangzhou to return to work. Subsequently, Sichuan, Chongqing, Henan, Hunan have opened a special train of migrant workers to return to work, help migrant workers return to the city. China's 21st Century Business Herald released a map of its data and news products on Thursday, charting the progress of industrial enterprises in various provinces. Overall, the industrial resumption rate in many provinces is already above 50% .

At the same time, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Gansu and other places have also announced that the catering industry, shopping malls can also open for business, in the wave of resumption of work, enterprises in the struggle to try to restore business life.

Since February 12, the resumption of production and full resumption of production has become the dominant theme in the media field: On February 24, Caixin weekly put the cover story on "preparation for resumption of work" to show the entire process of resumption of work and production, on February 27, "Sanlian life weekly" new crown special issue series of the third issue of the same omni-directional display of the theme of "ready to resume work. Meanwhile, the subtitle of the cover story "learn to live with the epidemic" is equally compelling.

For a large number of enterprises, the wave of resumption of work does not mean the end of the epidemic, but the arrival of a new round of tests. Next, they will face how to deal with the epidemic, balance will be the key.

Ren said that the loss of the Spring Festival archives and the delay in returning to work have caused irreparable and incalculable losses, with tourism, catering, hotels, transportation, real estate and other hard-hit industries accounting for as much as 30 percent of GDP and employment, what we have here is an uncertain future for GDP and employment. Liang Xinjun, in an open class at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business, predicted a second wave of demand and supply shocks from the outbreak, which could lead to the closure of small and medium sized businesses, an increase in unemployment, and a decline in household incomes. The shock is not expected to end in April or May.

When the focus of public opinion on the enterprise from the epidemic to start, itself has formed a fusion of the status quo and the future of the reminder. In the expectation of "the future will come" , the record of the current phenomenon has become a realistic lesson plan of the evolution of social organizations.

In the outbreak of the epidemic, the advantage of market technology and efficiency filled the blind spot that the administrative power could not reach, and the administrative power then became the key element of overall direction. However, in the new stage, when the market economies themselves have more normalized demand, the administrative power to help the policy and one-size-fits-all constraints have formed a contradiction. After many rounds of top-down mobilization, bottom-up trade-offs, the pace of resumption is about some kind of balance.

In the huge social governance system, the interaction between the market and the administrative coordinate system always needs the space to discuss and the will to optimize, and there is always the need to find the optimal solution.

In the outbreak of the epidemic, the advantage of market technology and efficiency filled the blind spot that the administrative power could not reach, and the administrative power then became the key element of overall direction. However, in the new stage, when the market economies themselves have more normalized demand, the administrative power to help the policy and one-size-fits-all constraints have formed a contradiction. After many rounds of top-down mobilization, bottom-up trade-offs, the pace of resumption is about some kind of balance.

From paying attention to the situation of fighting against the epidemic, to gazing at the "people" in the epidemic situation and their lives during the epidemic situation, to focusing on the "disaster situation" and the "full resumption of work" in all walks of life under the impact of the epidemic situation, the Chinese public opinion field during the period of fighting the epidemic situation, the expansion of core issues not only enriches the dimension of discussion, but also enlarges the threshold of influence of public opinion.

"Sansheng" (WECHAT PUBLIC ID: Tosansheng) once recorded in "Chinese public opinion field 3 during the anti-epidemic period" , when the focus of attention from the epidemic situation itself to focus on the epidemic "I" life, it means that "the immediate impact of the epidemic on every participant in public opinion is rising significantly" and "this matter is already everyone's business" .

Now the shift is happening again. The debate over the current state of economies under the impact of the epidemic continues to gain momentum. The discussion, whether focusing on the micro-life of individuals or the macro-economic context of the country, leads to a further strengthening of the social sentiment that "everyone is becoming a witness to the epidemic" . Along with this, with the coming of the resumption of construction, the discussion scene of "special period" is objectively shifting from "long vacation life" to the relatively abnormal daily work. The process of epidemic situation is deepening, the influence is deepening, and the discussion context is changing from "emergency time" to "new normal" .

This process has been accompanied by changes in the role of the commercial power as a subject in different times:

In the initial stage of anti-epidemic, the situation of epidemic situation is changing rapidly, and the measures of different enterprises to combat epidemic situation are focused on. Commercial power is one of many social forces responding to the epidemic.

Through the rapid release of information, the perspective of the report began to look at the epidemic affected the different individuals. This individual "natural person" to the "enterprise individual" . At this point, because of the epidemic and operating conditions are greatly affected, cash flow of a number of small and medium-sized enterprises become the leading role of public opinion ecology. Companies have gone from being the ones who fought the epidemic to being the victims of it.

With the coming of the resumption period and the public opinion fermentation, it calls for reducing the one-size-fits-all anti-epidemic control, and promotes the sound level of enterprises to resume work. People's focus on the enterprise, back to when the enterprise can assume its original role.

A hundred years ago, Lippmann wrote in the classic book of Public Opinion, Modern Society is so large and complex, so much so that we can only act on our mental picture of the world, a simulation of the world, woven together with all kinds of information. Public opinion is formed by the collection of the world's cognitive picture in the public mind. The field of public opinion and reality are always constructing and influencing each other.

A hundred years later, the same is true. The image of commercial power is constantly changing in the field of public opinion. Meanwhile, in the process of the continuous shaping of the face of commercial power, the huge tension formed by the combination of reality and public opinion field pushes each of us from a present occupied by epidemic situation, towards A pandemic-affected future.

01 | Mobilization and Response

January 20th is the cognitive origin of the whole people's anti-epidemic. In terms of social awareness, it was a public speech in Zhong Nanshan, while in terms of administrative awareness, it was the supreme leader's important instruction of the day on the outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia. Two lines are released from the mainstream media, "anti-epidemic" has become the main body of the community to release social mobilization.

On January 23rd, the city of Wuhan was sealed off. Wuhan is in a constant state of emergency. Helping Wuhan becomes the central task of the anti-epidemic work.

In the face of the still uncertain trend of the epidemic situation, some media have also written articles to analyze the tasks and challenges faced by Internet enterprises under the situation of fighting the epidemic situation, and summarize the enterprise's countermeasures. On January 22, Caijing published an article on its public account: "The internet fights the new pneumonia. ". The article concludes that in the area of medical supplies, masks are in short supply and prices are rising, and summarizes the announcements made by e-commerce platforms and upstream medical enterprises that do not allow price increases while announcing efforts to increase production. In the tourism sector, in the face of traffic, accommodation and other areas of a large number of unsubscribe, ctrip, flying pig, the same way elong almost all travel platform industry issued a notice of the security measures.

On January 23, Sansheng also published a report entitled "Commercial General Mobilization before and after the closure of the city" , which takes Wuhan as the central node and analyzes the relevant safeguards issued by the merchants before and after the closure of the city. In addition to taking stock of the protective measures against price increases, increasing the supply of masks and refunding tickets at preferential rates, issued by e-commerce and travel platforms before the closure of the city, sansheng also recorded the efforts made by enterprises to ensure the supply of daily life in Wuhan after the closure of the city. For example, in response to the shortage of materials for daily life in Wuhan, Wuhan Hema issued a public announcement that it would spare no efforts to ensure that prices would not be raised or closed.

However, before and after the closure of the city in the field of public opinion, the action of the business report and inventory is still less. For most of the media, the focus at this time is still on the rapid development of the epidemic form. At the same time, most of the enterprise's anti-epidemic measures are still in the declaration-based, concrete measures are in the initial stage.

On January 29, the The Economic Observer published a report, "Wuhan in the air, a relay race of enterprises fighting against the epidemic is going on. " In the form of a field interview with the enterprise back to the epidemic: the Article Interviewed Debon Express Management Staff Yan Dongfang. Under the leadership of chairman Cui Weixing, debang logistics immediately organized 47 emergency teams to transport disaster relief materials for the city of Wuhan using the company's own truck resources. The article also reported that on January 25, Cainiao Network, in conjunction with domestic and overseas logistics enterprises such as Zhongtong, Debang and AirCity, opened domestic and global green channels for the free transportation of donated relief materials from all over the world to the Wuhan area. On January 27, three SF planes brought in 70 tons of relief supplies for Wuhan.

At the same time, this paper also puts forward an important viewpoint on the phenomenon of efficient delivery of medical supplies by enterprises, "In Wuhan, the organisation is being deployed by the government to fill in the gaps where administrative power is hard to reach and to take on some of the responsibility for responding to the epidemic. They are generally more flexible and efficient than the administrative system and have more specialized equipment and technology reserves."

With this point of view cross-corroboration of a core public opinion hot spot is the people of Wuhan medical supplies shortage of concern. To January 23, a number of hospitals, including Wuchang Hospital and Wuhan Union Hospital, have posted on the Internet urgent requests for medical resources, asking for donations of safety products such as goggles and N95 face masks. Has Been widely discussed on the Internet.

On January 30, the "people of the day" report, "where are those medical supplies going? " , went a step further to address the crux of the medical supply problem: The supply side, it is inefficient to apply for approval at every level of the existing medical supply system: If there is an emergency response and the construction unit needs a mask, contact the government first, and the staff of the Government Emergency Response Office contact the Health Commission, health Council through a special department by the supplier layer to the factory. Factory production completed by the health and related departments to drive away contact follow-up transport. If resources are mobilized across provinces, there is a unified national deployment. The result was a huge material gap in Wuhan, severely testing the speed of administration. Official supplies will not arrive in time. "The speed of information exchange on the Internet, the ability to mobilize resources, coupled with the enthusiasm of citizens and action, may be faster than the administrative speed to run. "

Meanwhile, at the transportation level, both official relief supplies and social donations at home and abroad are also facing a shortage of transportation capacity, a doctor at Wuhan Puren Hospital responded to reporters after a call for help was sent, Sanlian Life Weekly reported in its investigative Article "Wuhan Medical Supplies: What can we do? " The hospital actually got a lot of calls about donations. Most of these calls, however, did not translate into effective relief because "supplies could not get in" .

Combined with the information presented by the public opinion field at that time, on the one hand, the basic information sharing platforms set up by the micro-blog, wechat and other communities successfully played the role of the aggregator of social donations; on the other hand, alibaba Jd.com and other e-commerce platform integration of medical production resources to speed up production, and Organization of Logistics Forces for distribution and a series of grasp, in the environment at the time reflected a very important value.

In addition to the transportation of goods and materials, we also found from the media's real-time reports that the commercial force also plays a role in other aspects of social mobilization, cooperating with the administrative force to make up for the absence of the administrative force.

On Jan. 24, Didi set up a "medical security team" of 100 drivers to connect with three hospitals in Wuhan to provide services to medical workers who had difficulty traveling during the city's closure due to the suspension of public transportation, the The Economic Observer reported. On January 25, the Beijing News, Nandu weekly and other media reported that the Wuhan Hotel Industry has organized to invite medical staff to stay nearby for free, and more than 235 Wuhan Hotels Receive Medical Staff for free.

In the case of the Red Cross in Hubei Province, which drew national attention in late January and early February, after it was revealed by almost all media that a large backlog of donated materials in Red Cross warehouses had been difficult to distribute to hospitals, on January 31, kyushu Medical Logistics Company officially assists Wuhan Red Cross in reloading supplies. A staff member at Kyushu Tong said emergency medical supplies could be delivered and distributed within two hours, according to a live Phoenix News report. At the same time, on February 3, the southern weekend also made a follow-up report on the distribution of materials after the arrival of Kyushu: "after foreign aid" assists the Wuhan Red Cross Society: Tally efficiency is improved, the distribution should listen to instructions" .

After the fact and Public Opinion Field Double Fermentation, the enterprise in the disaster relief technology and the efficiency superiority also gradually obtained the official affirmation and the response: February 10 news conference, chen Yueliang, director of the grass-roots Regime Building and Community Governance Department of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, called on Big Internet companies such as Alibaba tencent to develop community public software for community epidemic prevention workers and make it available to them. "A good cause is worth more than a billion dollars, " he said

Ali and tencent responded on Weibo, saying they were ready for Alibaba Cloud's response: Alibaba Cloud, together with alipay and nail, has launched a free smart community epidemic prevention and control program, can Help community front-line staff to complete the entry and exit registration, Health Punch card, epidemic notice and other work. TENCENT'S RESPONSE: Community Outbreak Management Tool Ready. February 8 tencent Haina Community Electronic Pass has been launched, all residents to declare health information, the realization of government departments to view the epidemic data.

January 20th is the cognitive origin of the whole people's anti-epidemic. In terms of social awareness, it was a public speech in Zhong Nanshan, while in terms of administrative awareness, it was the supreme leader's important instruction of the day on the outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia. Two lines are released from the mainstream media, "anti-epidemic" has become the main body of the community to release social mobilization.

On January 23rd, the city of Wuhan was sealed off. Wuhan is in a constant state of emergency. Helping Wuhan becomes the central task of the anti-epidemic work.

In the face of the still uncertain trend of the epidemic situation, some media have also written articles to analyze the tasks and challenges faced by Internet enterprises under the situation of fighting the epidemic situation, and summarize the enterprise's countermeasures. On January 22, Caijing published an article on its public account: "The internet fights the new pneumonia. ". The article concludes that in the area of medical supplies, masks are in short supply and prices are rising, and summarizes the announcements made by e-commerce platforms and upstream medical enterprises that do not allow price increases while announcing efforts to increase production.

02 | help yourself

When the time comes to the end of January, with the depth of media coverage and the gradual launch of anti-epidemic work, the focus of public opinion field from the focus on the situation to the epidemic of "people" concern. The fate of many small and micro enterprises has gradually attracted people's attention in the reports of visits to the subjects affected by the epidemic. The role of the entire business community in the public perception during the outbreak has gradually shifted from being a participant in the fight against the disease to being a risk taker.

The first industries to get attention are tourism and catering, two service industries that have lost large numbers of customers during the Spring Festival: January 31, the The Economic Observer article, "They in the stricken industry: Back to work for life, one hundred thousand per cent of monthly rent, and the policy of support in the hope" , reports on the plight of the couple, Bian Li, a tour guide, and kidney boy, who runs a barbecue restaurant in Chaoyang District. Similarly, burning finance and economics 240 hours to save yourself and him, a restaurant business, cAIXIN'S FOOD AND BEVERAGE INDUSTRY UNDER EPIDEMIC SITUATION: Hard to compress rental labor costs, high cash flow stress will be the food and beverage industry as the impact of the epidemic by the impact of the typical industry sample for analysis.

On Feb. 1, Jia Guolong, chairman of northwest naked face village, a large-scale chain restaurant, said in an interview with the China investment website that "the epidemic has left more than 20,000 employees unemployed, and their salaries can not last more than three months. ". "northwest naked oats village cash flow industry can not support three months. ". Large-scale catering enterprises in northwest naked face village for their own crisis of "self-exposure" further triggered a strong concern about the crisis of the catering industry.

In the field of industry, after a few days of Public Opinion Fermentation, focus on further expansion of the industry: The Economic Observer's February 4 report, "mother and baby shop closure caused by the industrial chain test: ready to endure for half a year, " the mother and baby industry as a perspective, it describes the dilemma faced by many manufacturing chains: "retail store suppliers are faced with stagnant returns due to terminal inactivity, and at the same time, money is pressed on the brand but can not get the goods, only to consume the inventory pressure; the brand side is carrying the burden of producing new goods can not come out, old goods can not circulate, but the cost is not a lot of burden a day. "

At the same time, in the field of venture capital, Zhu Xiaohu, Wang Ran, Wu Shichun and other investors to the venture investors and institutions gave almost the same advice: "strictly control costs, open source and save money, dead card cash flow. ". On the one hand, investment activities affected by the epidemic, the sharp decline in income. As investor Wang ran concluded in his speech, "Wang Ran: The impact of the current epidemic on start-up financing in the first half of the year, " "For all the financing that was originally planned to start after the festival, it is very likely that the actual external start-up due to the epidemic will not take place until March, and the completion of the transaction will almost certainly take until the second half of the year. ". At the same time, due to work stoppages, traffic control and other factors, new business is difficult to launch, income industry was greatly affected.

January 31st, the report, impact analysis and Policy Recommendations of the epidemic on the Chinese economy, published by Ren Zeping of the Evergrande Research Institute, systematizes the impact of the epidemic on the industry and the macro economic situation from a macro perspective: In the report, he analyzed, in medium-sized industries, the outbreak of food and beverage, tourism, film, transportation, education and training industries the biggest impact, medical, online games and other industries benefit. On the impact of micro-individuals, "production and business shutdown, income and cash flow disruption, but rent, wages, interest and other costs of rigid payments, enterprises will suffer huge losses. ". Disruption of operations may result in breach of contract and difficulty in capital turnover. Some small and medium-sized micro-, small-sized enterprises with weak anti-risk ability will face the predicament of bankruptcy and bankruptcy. Risks may also be transmitted up and down the supply chain and the guarantee chain as well as laterally, causing local crises.".

At the same time, macro-statistical data on the operating conditions of small and medium-sized enterprises also keep emerging. The data show that the situation is very grim: issued by china-europe Zhongchuang Platform, by Zhu Wuxiang, professor of the Department of Finance, School of Economics and management, Tsinghua University, in a survey of 995 small and medium sized enterprises, Liu Jun, general manager of Beijing Small and Micro Enterprises Comprehensive Financial Service Co. , and Wei Wei, a professor of management at Peking University's HSBC Business School, said: 85.1 per cent of smes indicated that the cash balance on their books could sustain them for less than three months. 29.58 per cent of businesses estimated that the epidemic had led to a decline in operating income of more than 50 per cent in 2020.

In the field of public opinion, the concern about the survival of smes has gradually become the mainstream. In the interaction between public opinion and reality, the two sides of the government and platform merchants have gradually introduced support policies for smes. On the one hand, real estate platforms such as Longhu District and Wanda have announced preferential rent policies, while Suzhou has also taken the lead in releasing the "Su 10" on February 4 to support small and micro enterprises in the city, some preferential methods, such as reducing or waiving rent and providing stable and low-interest loans, were put forward. At the same time, it also puts forward some measures to reduce the tax expense and social insurance expense of the employees for the small and medium-sized enterprises, so as to further reduce the amount of enterprise expenditure. For a period of time, various provinces, cities and platform businesses have issued protection policies for their small and medium-sized enterprises. Relevant financial media have summarized this: For example, protecting Small and medium-sized enterprises: A second front beyond epidemic prevention and control

At the same time, in the field of public opinion, business professionals such as Wu Xiaobo and Liang Xinjun have also expressed their views on ways for smes to save themselves: For example, the Public Channel Wu Xiaobo launched a series of "Go! Boss" live classes, 8 live-streaming sessions for SME owners on responding to the outbreak were recorded. On Feb. 21, Wu announced that it had completed four live online broadcasts, watched more than 10 million times, and received 59,987 applications.

Crises objectively open up new opportunities. Business links can deliver value as well as risk: in the marketplace, more and more of the emerging online economy is being reported and watched. And gradually led to the "home economy" heated discussion. Southern weekend published a report: "Fresh e-commerce "epidemic" outside the rise: reported the epidemic environment, such as daily excellent fresh e-commerce procurement and consumption of large growth. Sanlian life weekly has published a report entitled "The orgy of Boredom: Have you ever been to a disco? " Which tells the story of the popularity of the live-streaming disco music on Douyin. For the traditional online entertainment game field, the game media have been "the strongest hand Spring Festival file" describes the strong performance of hand tour.

In the online economy, online education and online work carry a lot of attention and expectation: Liang Xinjun pointed out in his open online course in Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business that it would "accelerate the growth" of both online education and online work, foster the maturity of the user and the supplier. The number of articles on both is enormous. However, judging from the trend of public opinion field, online and offline seems not so easy to split, there are still many problems to be solved.

Online education, February 10 to February 24, from the primary school to the university basically ushered in the "cloud open school" , social media often appear on the "teacher into the anchor" of the ridicule. But after the initial novelty wore off, some reports began to emerge about online education: on February 21st, after the publication on the Public Internet of Jianghu of the article "naked test, " online education was not "hot. " This paper analyzes the disadvantages of online education, such as poor conversion effect, difficulty of retention, and difficulty of online learning compared with offline teaching. And today, on public account, we published an article, "300 million students and teachers in the cloud: How to upgrade online education? " , which focuses on the difficulties encountered by teachers, parents and students in the new environment,

For the online office, in view of its inherent inefficiency and inapplicability, since February 10(Monday) large-scale resumption of Work Day, public opinion field on the "resumption of work matters needing attention" , "resumption of work tips" content is also significantly increased.

From the focus on the crisis, to discuss the future direction of the air, and then to the current offline appeal for guidance and response from the government. Business is gradually returning to normality and its original role.

However, for small and medium-sized enterprises, the crisis will still exist objectively for a long time. A brief boom in the online sector also depends on normalisation of the overall economic environment. For many industries of small and medium-sized enterprises, especially offline catering, tourism and other industries relying on offline flow, its consumption nature of irreplaceable can not be resolved objectively. In the ongoing impact of the epidemic, a large number of enterprises can not meet this temporary state, the need to ensure the smooth flow of cash on the one hand, while looking forward to the arrival of real normalcy soon.

03 | coordinates and balance

In the field of public opinion, while the whole people continue to strictly control the epidemic situation, a reflection on another phenomenon began to appear. On the one hand, the rate of case growth has objectively declined, on the other hand, the loss of too "one-size-fits-all" prevention and control measures is further seen through the media and social networks. In the field of public opinion, the Voice of public opinion calling for society to release itself from the wartime state of comprehensive prevention and control of epidemic situation began to appear obviously, and the viewpoint of taking care of epidemic prevention and economic life was gradually rising.

The phenomenon of one-size-fits-all and one-size-fits-all is embodied in the one-size-fits-all obstruction of the movement of people and materials by some grass-roots government departments, which has closed the located in the administrative territorial entity area mechanically. Such anti-epidemic measures, become imposed on the head of both the epidemic situation outside the apparent bondage.

As early as the end of January, the media to hard nuclear epidemic prevention in the NAME OF A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL EPIDEMIC PREVENTION MODEL TO BE REFLECTED:

On January 29, the Economic Information Daily published an editorial entitled "Epidemic Review | Upgrading Epidemic Prevention measures should not be carried out in a simple and crude "one-size-fits-all" . The article mentioned that, "Some local governments, especially grass-roots governments, have turned the epidemic prevention race into an all-out arms race. ". For example, the National Health and Welfare Commission has proposed that "entering the net and entering the family" should be the first line of defense for the prevention and control of the epidemic in the community; some local governments have arbitrarily upgraded epidemic prevention operations, acquiescing or encouraging village committees to dig roads to "close villages" or to affix slogans to "close households" , triggering discrimination and attacks against the returnees in Wuhan; and some county governments have issued red-headed documents prohibiting the entry of vehicles from Hubei, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Chongqing and other provinces, arousing antagonism between officials and residents in different provinces.

Once again, the individual became a point of reflection, and people published an investigative report, drifting on the highway, chronicling the story of freight driver Xiao Hongbing: As highways were closed everywhere, he could not enter the city for rest because his license plate was Hubei Province, so he drove on the highway for 4 days and 4 nights without interruption. Finally, he stayed in the service area in consultation with the traffic police.

Such "hard nuclear epidemic prevention" measures were originally designated for the most severe period of the epidemic in Hubei Province. However, with the resumption of work in various provinces on February 10 and the continuous reduction of new cases of the epidemic in areas outside Hubei, the strict control of some grass-roots "sports-style" has made the need for enterprises to resume work a castle in the air, which has led to growing opposition in the media.

On February 10, China News weekly published a report, "the first batch of enterprises to resume work is more than one-third difficult, small and medium-sized enterprises close to the red line of survival, " indicating that many enterprises because "migrant workers can not return to work, goods can not be delivered, simply can not start work. ".

Two days later, the policy signals from the China State Council Executive Meeting and the Standing Committee of the Politburo led to a series of articles on the "one size fits all" issue in the media field, it led to a series of policy changes.

In the China State Council executive meeting on February 12, requirements "to do a good job in various prevention and control work at the same time, in an orderly manner to promote the resumption of work and production, at the same time, clearly put forward "the main labor exports and imports to do a good job of migrant workers and other key groups back to work docking and services. ". We will correct the practice of "one-size-fits-all" persuading foreign vehicles and personnel to return

Subsequently, a press release issued by the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau also mentioned that non-epidemic prevention and control key areas should focus on the implementation of precise prevention and control by zoning, classification and control, and the overall planning of epidemic prevention and control and the restoration of economic and social order. According to the principle of scientific prevention and control, we should take the county as the unit, determine the risk level of different counties, and formulate the differentiated prevention and Control Strategy. Party committees and governments at all levels should do a good job in preventing and controlling the Seek truth from facts, correct biased and extreme practices in a timely manner, and do not simply close the door and shut it down, so as to minimize the impact of epidemic prevention and control on the production and livelihood of the people.

"co-ordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic and the restoration of economic and social order, " and rectify practices such as "one-size-fits-all" persuasion of foreign vehicles and personnel, which have become official administrative signals, it indicates that Chinese society is gradually beginning to release from the "wartime state" of fighting against epidemic disease in a comprehensive way.

Subsequently, the media for one-size-fits-all related reports continue to increase, calls for a full resumption of the voice gradually dominated the mainstream.

On February 13, "Zepin macro" released a related research report of the Evergrande Research Institute, "warning of the phenomenon of "one-size-fits-all, layer upon layer" in the prevention and control of epidemic situations in various places, " and directly named the "even with preferential policies, " But the current epidemic prevention and control system is still allowing enterprises to suffer a large number of losses. According to the report, the tight control of the epidemic has resulted in delays in the return of workers and the delivery of goods, as well as one-size-fits-all work stoppages still in use by many governments, causing a large number of service enterprises to suspend work and delay the resumption of work, although all kinds of supporting measures have been issued, but enterprises still need to pay for the loss of work stoppage, cash flow pressure increased sharply.

From Feb. 16, Hu Xijin, editor in chief of the Global Times, also issued a call to resume work on Weibo, a microblog service that said, "encouragement to return to work has also been shouted as a slogan, but many of the practical conditions for returning to work are still incomplete, or even lack the practical impetus for their rapid formation. For example, many places do not encourage workers from other places to return quickly, some units do not dare to let their employees go to work on a large scale, and local governments easily do not dare to encourage people to go out and spend on the basis of strengthening self-protection. No city dares to take the lead in restoring the normal state of society. "

In the interaction with the public opinion field, the pace of the resumption of work has been slowly pushed forward, a new round of local mobilization began: February 16, the first special train for migrant workers to resume work from Guiyang, Hangzhou to return to work. Subsequently, Sichuan, Chongqing, Henan, Hunan have opened a special train of migrant workers to return to work, help migrant workers return to the city. China's 21st Century Business Herald released a map of its data and news products on Thursday, charting the progress of industrial enterprises in various provinces. Overall, the industrial resumption rate in many provinces is already above 50% .

At the same time, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Gansu and other places have also announced that the catering industry, shopping malls can also open for business, in the wave of resumption of work, enterprises in the struggle to try to restore business life.

Since February 12, the resumption of production and full resumption of production has become the dominant theme in the media field: On February 24, Caixin weekly put the cover story on "preparation for resumption of work" to show the entire process of resumption of work and production, on February 27, "Sanlian life weekly" new crown special issue series of the third issue of the same omni-directional display of the theme of "ready to resume work. Meanwhile, the subtitle of the cover story "learn to live with the epidemic" is equally compelling.

For a large number of enterprises, the wave of resumption of work does not mean the end of the epidemic, but the arrival of a new round of tests. Next, they will face how to deal with the epidemic, balance will be the key.

Ren said that the loss of the Spring Festival archives and the delay in returning to work have caused irreparable and incalculable losses, with tourism, catering, hotels, transportation, real estate and other hard-hit industries accounting for as much as 30 percent of GDP and employment, what we have here is an uncertain future for GDP and employment. Liang Xinjun, in an open class at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business, predicted a second wave of demand and supply shocks from the outbreak, which could lead to the closure of small and medium sized businesses, an increase in unemployment, and a decline in household incomes. The shock is not expected to end in April or May.

When the focus of public opinion on the enterprise from the epidemic to start, itself has formed a fusion of the status quo and the future of the reminder. In the expectation of "the future will come" , the record of the current phenomenon has become a realistic lesson plan of the evolution of social organizations.

In the outbreak of the epidemic, the advantage of market technology and efficiency filled the blind spot that the administrative power could not reach, and the administrative power then became the key element of overall direction. However, in the new stage, when the market economies themselves have more normalized demand, the administrative power to help the policy and one-size-fits-all constraints have formed a contradiction. After many rounds of top-down mobilization, bottom-up trade-offs, the pace of resumption is about some kind of balance.

In the huge social governance system, the interaction between the market and the administrative coordinate system always needs the space to discuss and the will to optimize, and there is always the need to find the optimal solution.

In the field of public opinion, while the whole people continue to strictly control the epidemic situation, a reflection on another phenomenon began to appear. On the one hand, the rate of case growth has objectively declined, on the other hand, the loss of too "one-size-fits-all" prevention and control measures is further seen through the media and social networks. In the field of public opinion, the Voice of public opinion calling for society to release itself from the wartime state of comprehensive prevention and control of epidemic situation began to appear obviously, and the viewpoint of taking care of epidemic prevention and economic life was gradually rising.
