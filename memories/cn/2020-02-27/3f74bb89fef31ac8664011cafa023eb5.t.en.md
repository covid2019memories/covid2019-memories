More than two months into the new coronavirus epidemic, knowledge of the culprit remains limited.

On Feb. 22, Southern Medical University researchers studied the sequences of 39 new coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) and found that the virus was likely to appear around November 2019. This conclusion is consistent with what academics and officials believe to be the earliest case, with the first case generally accepted by the health sector and the CDC to have occurred on 8 December 2019, a paper in the Lancet puts the date at 1 December 2019.

After comparing the genetic sequences of 38 viral strains, the researchers found that the virus had changed little, though it had changed since the outbreak.

The researchers found 117 mutations, which are not clustered and are relatively evenly distributed across the genome, suggesting that the current mutations have not been particularly "radical" .

The research, which was first published online in the Journal of Southern Medical Public Health, was conducted by a team led by Professor Zhang Bao, associate director of the Southern Medical University's laboratory for Biosafety Protection III (P3) .

Teams of researchers around the world are trying to crack the new coronavirus. Many P3 laboratories in Zhejiang, Beijing, Hubei and Wuhan are conducting in Vivo virus related research.

Although the genome of the virus is being analyzed soon after the outbreak, and the genome is being revealed in layers, it is difficult to explain why the virus is so transmissible. When the virus appeared, whether there was an intermediate host, what the source of infection was, and whether the infection would persist, are also mysteries. These questions are also the key to unlock the strong transmission of new coronavirus password.

"To be honest, we still don't know where the virus came from. "

There is no word yet on who was the first new case of pneumonia, and some have even predicted, gloomily, that it will end up like the search for the first case of SARS.

From the first case, the epidemiological investigation can be used to deduce the origin of the virus and to find the source of infection. The paper, with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and prevention as its main participant, generally listed Dec. 8,2019, as the first hospital stay for patients with the outbreak, which is also officially recognized by the Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission.

In a paper published in the Lancet, Cao Bin, vice president of the China Japan Friendship Hospital, cited a case hospitalized on December 1,2019, as the first case of the outbreak.

Another way, is through the study of the viral gene sequence, through the characteristics of the virus genome, to estimate the emergence of the virus time. Zhang Bao's team used TempEst, an evolutionary time signal analysis software, to analyze the current genomic data, and then performed a TMRCA (time of last common ancestor) analysis.

According to the above idea, the best parameters of the nucleotide substitution model were selected and the sampling time was 23 January 2020 as the 10th day. The researchers finally calculated that the emergence time of the new coronavirus was from 38.9 days to 119.3 days, between September 23,2019 and December 15,2019. "according to the model, the virus appeared on average 73 days before January 23, and the 95% confidence interval was between 38 and 113 days. Therefore, November 10,2019 was the average, " Zhang Bao told CAIJING.

"The virus first appeared in November 2019, " a prediction that fits with a report in science.

On January 24, Cao Bin, Deputy Director of Beijing China-japan Friendship Hospital, and Huang Chaolin, chief physician of Thoracic Surgery, Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, published an online paper in the Lancet, the clinical symptoms of the 41 patients who were initially infected were analyzed and summarized. 27 of the 41 patients were found to have been exposed to the south China Seafood Market, and the case on December 1,2019 was considered as the earliest case of this epidemic.

Two days later, science quoted Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at the Georgetown University, as saying: If the first case occurs on December 1, there really is no history of exposure at the south China Wholesale Seafood Market, given the incubation period, the person most likely contracted the virus in November. "The virus was brought into the market and then taken out of the market, " he said.

Still, "to be honest, we still don't know where the virus came from, " Cao Bin told science.

Mutations have been occurring and no new strains have been created

More than 77,000 cases had been confirmed in China alone as of 18:00 on February 24, more than two months after the onset of the new coronavirus. The public is wondering if the virus is mutating fast, if it can do more damage. A number of recent studies have dispelled such fears.

Zhang Bao's team compared the genetic sequences of 38 strains of the virus and found that the differences between the nucleotides were very small, with a total of 117 variations, based on the earliest sequence determined, and that the mutations were not clustered, is relatively evenly distributed throughout the genome.

The Hong Kong researchers found that the Hong Kong strain was only six nucleotides short of the Wuhan Strain.

Nucleotides are the genetic material of viruses, controlling their replication and determining their properties. There are 30,000 nucleotides in the whole of Sars-cov-2, and there are currently six mutations, only a very small proportion.

On February 19, Yu Wenbin, a researcher at the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other scholars, the researchers found no reprogramming of the virus genome after studying genomic data from 93 new coronavirus samples, according to a paper published on Chinaxiv, a pre publication platform for scientific papers published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 120 nucleotides, or 0.41% of the length of the sequence, were mutated between 93 genomes, and the mutations were distributed evenly in 10 coding regions.

The good news, the researchers conclude, is that the new coronavirus genome has not been reprogrammed, meaning that no entirely new strains of the virus have been created.

In fact, the virus mutates all the time. The new coronavirus is an RNA virus. "unlike human genes, RNA viruses have no calibration mechanism in the replication process, " a researcher at the Shanghai Clinical Center for Public Health told CAIJING.

From an evolutionary point of view, the evolution of the virus to its own advantage, to become more "toxic" , will kill the host, oneself also have no place to hide, not conducive to reproduction. But it's spreading faster, and it's clearly the weapon of SARS-CoV-2.

Some scholars remind that after two months of the epidemic, we should be vigilant to accelerate the spread of the new coronavirus.

On February 18th Mu-ming Poo, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Wu Zhongyi, a professor at the National Sun Yat-sen University, wrote in the National Science Review that during the SARS epidemic in 2003, the virus spread more slowly in the early two months after it began to spread, into A medium-term acceleration phase. The first phase of the evolution of the SARS virus was just two months ago, the researchers caution, and the outbreak "worst case scenario is that after a two-month 'slow evolution' pattern, the 2019-nCoV 'fumbled' an evolutionary path and started to take off. "

Although the genome of the virus was quickly deciphered and many papers published at home and abroad also revealed the genomic features, these features could not explain the strong transmission of the new coronavirus.

Nih and University of Texas at Austin, NIH. Using freeze electron microscopy, McLellan's team found that SARS-COV-2 and SARS virus s protein had the same functional host cell Ace2, but the former had 10 times more extracellular domain attraction than SARS virus.

This is only one aspect of the explanation for the virus's power to spread. The whole process of transmission, including virus invasion, shedding, RNA transcription synthesis, protein translation and assembly, virus maturation and release, all determine the transmission ability. Strong transmission, the virus in the human has a good adaptability, perhaps it is time to change our surrounding environment and its own behavior.

"All virus sequences after January 22 are foreign. "

Does the new coronavirus continue to evolve in humans? If the answer is no, the virus does not mutate rapidly, which is a reassurance against the epidemic.

The change of the transmissibility of the virus is related to the change of the virus genome sequence, and the tracking of the change needs the scientists to compare the virus sequence of different phases and different regions of the epidemic. However, this work is being held back.

"As of February 10,2020, a total of 55 COVID-19 genomes had been published, of which 31 sequences obtained before January 22 were almost all from China. However, after January 22, the remaining 24 figures were all from outside the country,"said academician Mu-ming Poo and Professor Wu Zhongyi in the commentary, "The gaps in the data background make it difficult to find continuous patterns in time and geography. ".

The first team to publish the sequence of the new coronavirus on the virological.org  website for global researchers to share was a team led by Zhang Yongzhen, a researcher at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and an adjunct professor at the Public Health at the Fudan University. They submitted the sequence at China Standard Time on the morning of January 11. Virological is an open forum on Virology and Infectious Diseases.

"although the sequence submitted by Zhang Yongzhen's team does not have a sample collection date, his contribution is very large and the sequence analysis is very good, " Zhang Bao said. The sequence submission is very important, equivalent to the original data, it is a fundamental source for analyzing the evolution of viral mutations and traits, and having enough sequences is essential for scientific research, "The quality of the data is also critical, such as the date the sample was collected, the location of the patient, the relationship between the patient and the patient, and the state of the patient's illness. "

However, the P3 laboratory at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, where Zhang worked, was shut down on Jan. 13, according to people familiar with the matter. The laboratory did not receive a clear answer after it submitted a corrective report. "I don't know why, but everything happened after the sequence was made public. reapplying for the culture of live viruses and other related research could not be approved, " said a staff member at the Shanghai Clinical Center for Public Health.

"P3 needs regulatory approval to grow live viruses, such as for research to track their mutations. But their laboratory is still in the period of reorganization, can only do some clinical tests at present,"said a co-worker of the laboratory told CAIJING.".

What are the reasons for the closure of the laboratory, and when can the related test work be carried out after the rectification? As of press time, the Shanghai Municipal Health and Health Commission did not respond.

The prevention and control of SARS 17 years ago can provide reference for the control of this epidemic situation. But more viral genome research and sequencing is needed to allow scientists to compare the two viruses and understand their evolutionary dynamics.

As academician Mu-ming Poo and Professor Wu Zhongyi put it in the commentary: "given the current severe situation of the epidemic, it is against the ethics of scientific research to choose not to disclose data related to the virus. "

More than two months into the new coronavirus epidemic, knowledge of the culprit remains limited.

On Feb. 22, Southern Medical University researchers studied the sequences of 39 new coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) and found that the virus was likely to appear around November 2019. This conclusion is consistent with what academics and officials believe to be the earliest case, with the first case generally accepted by the health sector and the CDC to have occurred on 8 December 2019, a paper in the Lancet puts the date at 1 December 2019.

After comparing the genetic sequences of 38 viral strains, the researchers found that the virus had changed little, though it had changed since the outbreak.

The researchers found 117 mutations, which are not clustered and are relatively evenly distributed across the genome, suggesting that the current mutations have not been particularly "radical" .

The research, which was first published online in the Journal of Southern Medical Public Health, was conducted by a team led by Professor Zhang Bao, associate director of the Southern Medical University's laboratory for Biosafety Protection III (P3) .

Teams of researchers around the world are trying to crack the new coronavirus. Many P3 laboratories in Zhejiang, Beijing, Hubei and Wuhan are conducting in Vivo virus related research.

Although the genome of the virus is being analyzed soon after the outbreak, and the genome is being revealed in layers, it is difficult to explain why the virus is so transmissible. When the virus appeared, whether there was an intermediate host, what the source of infection was, and whether the infection would persist, are also mysteries. These questions are also the key to unlock the strong transmission of new coronavirus password.

These questions are also the key to unlock the strong transmission of new coronavirus password.

"To be honest, we still don't know where the virus came from. "

There is no word yet on who was the first new case of pneumonia, and some have even predicted, gloomily, that it will end up like the search for the first case of SARS.

From the first case, the epidemiological investigation can be used to deduce the origin of the virus and to find the source of infection. The paper, with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and prevention as its main participant, generally listed Dec. 8,2019, as the first hospital stay for patients with the outbreak, which is also officially recognized by the Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission.

In a paper published in the Lancet, Cao Bin, vice president of the China Japan Friendship Hospital, cited a case hospitalized on December 1,2019, as the first case of the outbreak.

Another way, is through the study of the viral gene sequence, through the characteristics of the virus genome, to estimate the emergence of the virus time. Zhang Bao's team used TempEst, an evolutionary time signal analysis software, to analyze the current genomic data, and then performed a TMRCA (time of last common ancestor) analysis.

According to the above idea, the best parameters of the nucleotide substitution model were selected and the sampling time was 23 January 2020 as the 10th day. The researchers finally calculated that the emergence time of the new coronavirus was from 38.9 days to 119.3 days, between September 23,2019 and December 15,2019. "according to the model, the virus appeared on average 73 days before January 23, and the 95% confidence interval was between 38 and 113 days. Therefore, November 10,2019 was the average, " Zhang Bao told CAIJING.

"The virus first appeared in November 2019, " a prediction that fits with a report in science.

On January 24, Cao Bin, Deputy Director of Beijing China-japan Friendship Hospital, and Huang Chaolin, chief physician of Thoracic Surgery, Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, published an online paper in the Lancet, the clinical symptoms of the 41 patients who were initially infected were analyzed and summarized. 27 of the 41 patients were found to have been exposed to the south China Seafood Market, and the case on December 1,2019 was considered as the earliest case of this epidemic.

Two days later, science quoted Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at the Georgetown University, as saying: If the first case occurs on December 1, there really is no history of exposure at the south China Wholesale Seafood Market, given the incubation period, the person most likely contracted the virus in November. "The virus was brought into the market and then taken out of the market, " he said.

Still, "to be honest, we still don't know where the virus came from, " Cao Bin told science.

Mutations have been occurring and no new strains have been created

More than 77,000 cases had been confirmed in China alone as of 18:00 on February 24, more than two months after the onset of the new coronavirus. The public is wondering if the virus is mutating fast, if it can do more damage. A number of recent studies have dispelled such fears.

Zhang Bao's team compared the genetic sequences of 38 strains of the virus and found that the differences between the nucleotides were very small, with a total of 117 variations, based on the earliest sequence determined, and that the mutations were not clustered, is relatively evenly distributed throughout the genome.

The Hong Kong researchers found that the Hong Kong strain was only six nucleotides short of the Wuhan Strain.

Nucleotides are the genetic material of viruses, controlling their replication and determining their properties. There are 30,000 nucleotides in the whole of Sars-cov-2, and there are currently six mutations, only a very small proportion.

On February 19, Yu Wenbin, a researcher at the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other scholars, the researchers found no reprogramming of the virus genome after studying genomic data from 93 new coronavirus samples, according to a paper published on Chinaxiv, a pre publication platform for scientific papers published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 120 nucleotides, or 0.41% of the length of the sequence, were mutated between 93 genomes, and the mutations were distributed evenly in 10 coding regions.

The good news, the researchers conclude, is that the new coronavirus genome has not been reprogrammed, meaning that no entirely new strains of the virus have been created.

In fact, the virus mutates all the time. The new coronavirus is an RNA virus. "unlike human genes, RNA viruses have no calibration mechanism in the replication process, " a researcher at the Shanghai Clinical Center for Public Health told CAIJING.

From an evolutionary point of view, the evolution of the virus to its own advantage, to become more "toxic" , will kill the host, oneself also have no place to hide, not conducive to reproduction. But it's spreading faster, and it's clearly the weapon of SARS-CoV-2.

Some scholars remind that after two months of the epidemic, we should be vigilant to accelerate the spread of the new coronavirus.

On February 18th Mu-ming Poo, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Wu Zhongyi, a professor at the National Sun Yat-sen University, wrote in the National Science Review that during the SARS epidemic in 2003, the virus spread more slowly in the early two months after it began to spread, into A medium-term acceleration phase. The first phase of the evolution of the SARS virus was just two months ago, the researchers caution, and the outbreak "worst case scenario is that after a two-month 'slow evolution' pattern, the 2019-nCoV 'fumbled' an evolutionary path and started to take off. "

Although the genome of the virus was quickly deciphered and many papers published at home and abroad also revealed the genomic features, these features could not explain the strong transmission of the new coronavirus.

Nih and University of Texas at Austin, NIH. Using freeze electron microscopy, McLellan's team found that SARS-COV-2 and SARS virus s protein had the same functional host cell Ace2, but the former had 10 times more extracellular domain attraction than SARS virus.

This is only one aspect of the explanation for the virus's power to spread. The whole process of transmission, including virus invasion, shedding, RNA transcription synthesis, protein translation and assembly, virus maturation and release, all determine the transmission ability. Strong transmission, the virus in the human has a good adaptability, perhaps it is time to change our surrounding environment and its own behavior.

Nucleotides are the genetic material of viruses, controlling their replication and determining their properties. There are 30,000 nucleotides in the whole of Sars-cov-2, and there are currently six mutations, only a very small proportion.

On February 19, Yu Wenbin, a researcher at the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other scholars, the researchers found no reprogramming of the virus genome after studying genomic data from 93 new coronavirus samples, according to a paper published on Chinaxiv, a pre publication platform for scientific papers published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 120 nucleotides, or 0.41% of the length of the sequence, were mutated between 93 genomes, and the mutations were distributed evenly in 10 coding regions.

The good news, the researchers conclude, is that the new coronavirus genome has not been reprogrammed, meaning that no entirely new strains of the virus have been created.

In fact, the virus mutates all the time. The new coronavirus is an RNA virus. "unlike human genes, RNA viruses have no calibration mechanism in the replication process, " a researcher at the Shanghai Clinical Center for Public Health told CAIJING.

From an evolutionary point of view, the evolution of the virus to its own advantage, to become more "toxic" , will kill the host, oneself also have no place to hide, not conducive to reproduction. But it's spreading faster, and it's clearly the weapon of SARS-CoV-2.

Some scholars remind that after two months of the epidemic, we should be vigilant to accelerate the spread of the new coronavirus.

On February 18th Mu-ming Poo, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Wu Zhongyi, a professor at the National Sun Yat-sen University, wrote in the National Science Review that during the SARS epidemic in 2003, the virus spread more slowly in the early two months after it began to spread, into A medium-term acceleration phase. The first phase of the evolution of the SARS virus was just two months ago, the researchers caution, and the outbreak "worst case scenario is that after a two-month 'slow evolution' pattern, the 2019-nCoV 'fumbled' an evolutionary path and started to take off. "

Although the genome of the virus was quickly deciphered and many papers published at home and abroad also revealed the genomic features, these features could not explain the strong transmission of the new coronavirus.

Nih and University of Texas at Austin, NIH. Using freeze electron microscopy, McLellan's team found that SARS-COV-2 and SARS virus s protein had the same functional host cell Ace2, but the former had 10 times more extracellular domain attraction than SARS virus.

This is only one aspect of the explanation for the virus's power to spread. The whole process of transmission, including virus invasion, shedding, RNA transcription synthesis, protein translation and assembly, virus maturation and release, all determine the transmission ability. Strong transmission, the virus in the human has a good adaptability, perhaps it is time to change our surrounding environment and its own behavior.

"All virus sequences after January 22 are foreign. "

Does the new coronavirus continue to evolve in humans? If the answer is no, the virus does not mutate rapidly, which is a reassurance against the epidemic.

The change of the transmissibility of the virus is related to the change of the virus genome sequence, and the tracking of the change needs the scientists to compare the virus sequence of different phases and different regions of the epidemic. However, this work is being held back.

"As of February 10,2020, a total of 55 COVID-19 genomes had been published, of which 31 sequences obtained before January 22 were almost all from China. However, after January 22, the remaining 24 figures were all from outside the country,"said academician Mu-ming Poo and Professor Wu Zhongyi in the commentary, "The gaps in the data background make it difficult to find continuous patterns in time and geography. ".

The first team to publish the sequence of the new coronavirus on the virological.org  website for global researchers to share was a team led by Zhang Yongzhen, a researcher at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and an adjunct professor at the Public Health at the Fudan University. They submitted the sequence at China Standard Time on the morning of January 11. Virological is an open forum on Virology and Infectious Diseases.

"although the sequence submitted by Zhang Yongzhen's team does not have a sample collection date, his contribution is very large and the sequence analysis is very good, " Zhang Bao said. The sequence submission is very important, equivalent to the original data, it is a fundamental source for analyzing the evolution of viral mutations and traits, and having enough sequences is essential for scientific research, "The quality of the data is also critical, such as the date the sample was collected, the location of the patient, the relationship between the patient and the patient, and the state of the patient's illness. "

However, the P3 laboratory at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, where Zhang worked, was shut down on Jan. 13, according to people familiar with the matter. The laboratory did not receive a clear answer after it submitted a corrective report. "I don't know why, but everything happened after the sequence was made public. reapplying for the culture of live viruses and other related research could not be approved, " said a staff member at the Shanghai Clinical Center for Public Health.

"P3 needs regulatory approval to grow live viruses, such as for research to track their mutations. But their laboratory is still in the period of reorganization, can only do some clinical tests at present,"said a co-worker of the laboratory told CAIJING.".

What are the reasons for the closure of the laboratory, and when can the related test work be carried out after the rectification? As of press time, the Shanghai Municipal Health and Health Commission did not respond.

The prevention and control of SARS 17 years ago can provide reference for the control of this epidemic situation. But more viral genome research and sequencing is needed to allow scientists to compare the two viruses and understand their evolutionary dynamics.

As academician Mu-ming Poo and Professor Wu Zhongyi put it in the commentary: "given the current severe situation of the epidemic, it is against the ethics of scientific research to choose not to disclose data related to the virus. "

Will patients with new coronary disease "relapse" ? The nucleic acid test of a few discharged patients was suspected to be false negative
The timing, duration and difficulty of seeing a doctor of these patients varied, but they still did not know whether they were "relapsing" or not cured? They had been counted as cured and discharged from the hospital, and the sudden onset of symptoms and retesting meant they were not actually cured.

With 505 confirmed and 11 removed from their posts, how can prisons prevent an outbreak?
As of 2400 hours on February 20, five prisons in Hubei, Zhejiang and Shandong had reported outbreaks of new coronavirus infection, all of which were imported cases. Of the 505 confirmed cases, no deaths had been reported.
Dialogue Yang Gonghuan: It is very likely that the new coronavirus will coexist with humans for a long time
"New coronaviruses are more likely to eventually co-exist with humans in the same way as influenza viruses and rely on vaccines for prevention and control. "

From the cold bench to the spotlight, chloroquine and other "chicken ribs" medicine into the new scheme of diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia
ABIDOL and chloroquine phosphate are still needed to be tested in clinical trials for the treatment of new coronary pneumonia. Clinical trials of the drugs should continue even after the outbreak is over, to prevent a relapse.

TAKATOMI RESPONDS TO CONTROVERSY: Can't fight on the Internet, working on a cunning virus
TAKATOMI's previous claims have been challenged by the new pneumonia outbreak, which has now surpassed SARS in both confirmed cases and deaths. Whether Takatomi and the CDC "failed in their duty" is at the center of the controversy.

Who was the first person to be genetically tested for new coronavirus pneumonia?
After the first "unclassified coronavirus" was detected by a third-party testing agency, the hospital was informed only by telephone. Three days later, the second case report read "SARS coronavirus. ". No one thought at the time that it was a COVID-19 attack.
Two new cases of coronary pneumonia with pathology results are available, and the autopsy is still under way
Researchers are trying to reveal the pathogenicity and lethality of the new coronavirus and provide new evidence for clinical treatment. The phase result is that the pathogenicity of the new coronavirus is similar to SARS, and the further result may be revealed by dissection.

Analysis of 70,000 new coronary disease cases: crude case-fatality rate 2.3% 
So far, there is no evidence of a superspreader event like the SARS outbreak, but the exact cause of the infection and the failure to prevent remains to be investigated.

From the lab to the ward, stop the new coronavirus
The tracing of the virus, the route of transmission from animal to human, and the mode of transmission from human to human are still in progress, and the development and validation of anti-viral vaccines and specific drugs are just beginning.
Dr Li Wenliang's last 40 days
There are no heroes who fall from the sky, only mortals who rise to the occasion, one netizen wrote. The young doctor, who has since died, is a reminder to those still fighting the epidemic that the battle is still hard.
Doctors and nurses in Hubei face the toughest month as infections mount
Unknown to the virus, lack of medical supplies, but also because of high-intensity work pressure to affect immunity, leading to the peak of medical infection. With the enhancement of the awareness and knowledge of virus, the relative protective measures are put in place, fewer and fewer medical staff should be infected in the later period.
