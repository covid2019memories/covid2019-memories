The machines are roaring again

Fuquan road in Ouhai District, five or six kilometers from Wenzhou South Railway Station, is dotted with shoe factories, supermarkets and fast food restaurants. Once bustling streets, now in the shadow of the epidemic appears a bit lonely.
Near the restaurant, employees of an electronics factory at the southern end of the road walk into a nearby fast food restaurant called Foshan, which is owned by a native of Hubei Province. Unable to return to Wenzhou, the factory temporarily rented the shop as a canteen for its employees. "I was forced to do it, so I had to figure it out, " a manager at the factory, surnamed Wang, said by telephone.
Wang has been very busy recently. Every day, he is doing various docking with the local government on the resumption of work, including reporting the situation, negotiating chartered buses to pick up employees from other provinces and cities to return to the factory, as well as recruiting new people urgently. With more than 110 employees returning from all over the country, the machines at his factory finally rumble again in the quiet industrial park.
The city of Wenzhou, 900 kilometers away from Wuhan, was once a city with a severe epidemic of new coronavirus. So far, its cumulative confirmed cases of more than 500 cases, is the largest city in Zhejiang Province infected. Binhai, once a city of factories and private businesses, is under pressure to return to work after the outbreak.
Wang's electronics factory mainly produces circuit boards, which are widely used in all kinds of electrical appliances. Last year, he said, the factory's output value of over 100 million, in the town of similar enterprises, can rank very high. The electronics factory has more than 200 employees, except for 34 administrative staff, the rest are line operators. "This time of year, workers have already returned to work, but this year the gap is quite big, " he said helplessly.
Circuit board industry is a strict order-based business model, by the customer orders after the factory is responsible for production, "unlike clothing, as can do more, more production of circuit board is not worth a penny, is a pile of garbage. " Manager Wang is very worried about, wenzhou has only recently resumed work, while other provinces have returned to work earlier in the same industry, if their factory can not meet the order, then the customer suddenly no.
February 22, Ningdu County, Ganzhou, Jiangxi. Two chartered cars sent by Wenzhou's Ouhai District government took 36 employees back to the city. That was a relief to Wang. This is the first batch of Ouhai district organization outside the Staff Charter, after getting the list of employees submitted by the enterprise, the vehicle went to Ganzhou the night before, waiting to meet the staff back to Zhejiang.
"I have been communicating with the staff of the district government, so our factory has more information and moves faster, " he said happily.
At the same time, only a handful of companies in the park have returned to work. Although many enterprises shout the slogan of returning to work, but in fact the difficulties are still numerous. On this road, crowded with businesses and factories, it is still more of a depression.

Charter bus

Wenzhou is a large city in Zhejiang with a floating population, with more than 2 million migrant workers. Last year, there were 330,000 migrant manufacturing workers from Hubei alone. The current epidemic prevention and control of the grim situation, no doubt blocked the Hubei Staff's way back to work.

According to Wang, there are 31 employees at his factory in Hubei Province, including eight senior executives. He revealed that the Ouhai district government's previous attitude is that the key epidemic area managers can first report, by the government to try to solve. But after he reported the names of Eight hubei-based executives, no action has been taken.
"It's probably because the government can't negotiate. Now Wenzhou doesn't allow Hubei employees to return to work, Hubei doesn't allow locals to come out, and both sides have strict controls. " While expressing understanding, but "the executives were all in a hurry, and everyone was getting scared and wanted to get out early. A lot of things in the factory were not done by computers, but had to be done on the spot. "
According to the current regulations of the Ouhai district government, before sending charters to other provinces and cities, enterprises first report the need for receiving people, indicating the province, city and county where they are located, and then the local staff stationed in the Ouhai district are unified deployed, return to Wenzhou after 20 employees. When there was no hope of picking someone up from Hubei, Wang had to consider the staff from other provinces first. The trouble is that not every trip is as smooth as Ganzhou.
The Electronics Factory has seven employees in Guizhou, who live scattered, Bijie, Liupanshui and other places. The area span is big, the unification collection is inconvenient. Although charters have long been sent to the local, but has not been able to gather enough people, this part of the staff can not pick up. "Ouhai District's hiring managers in Guizhou tell me it is not easy to pick up people from other places. Some local governments cooperate, some do not cooperate at all, that is very embarrassing. He ate steamed bread and instant noodles for several days in a row, and called almost all day every day to co-ordinate the demands of the government and business."
Perhaps as a result, Wang appreciated the district government's charter program. In his mind, Wenzhou and Ouhai District were among the first regions in Zhejiang to send cars to pick up workers and return to work. He thinks the government is ahead of its time and realizes that after the epidemic, employees will be the biggest problem for companies to get back to work. As a result, Ouhai District units in the first time to send special staff to bring back the field, but also on-site recruitment, to ease the pressure on enterprise employment. He remembers well that the day after the electronics factory picked up the workers from Ganzhou, the mayor of Wenzhou took his own team to the provinces to recruit workers.
In addition to the free car pick-up, Ouhai district also issued a return to work preferential policies, self-driving and car back to Ouhai District employees, car fares are subsidized by the government; if the enterprise concentrated rental of more than 10% of the total number of employees, rent subsidies of 10% ; For those "New Ouhai people" , if early return to work will also have the corresponding points, follow-up and children will benefit from school and so on.

"The mask won't take more than a few days. "

In the past week, the epidemic situation in Wenzhou has stabilized and there have been no new cases. As of February 26, there are 7 counties (cities, districts) epidemic risk reduction, the province's most. But with the resumption of work enterprises, personnel began to flow again, the pressure has not eased.
Wenzhou has been using the "health code" as an electronic passport since February 16. The health code is divided into green, yellow and red codes according to information such as the risk level of the epidemic throughout the country, the number of times an individual has stayed in an area where the epidemic is serious, and the state of his or her contact with close contacts, for authentication when passing through and returning to work in Wenzhou area.
Wang explained that the color of yards will change dynamically. Now only Green Code direct access, Yellow Code and red code to home or concentrated isolation for 7 days, 14 days. Employees returning from their factories are allowed to return to work only if their health code is green and their body temperature is normal.
In accordance with the previous Ouhai district government defined the resumption of work requirements, including this electronic plant and other key enterprises and high-tech enterprises is the first batch of resumption of work. Before the resumption of work, the management committee or the street will come to check whether the resumption of standards, each enterprise and the government has a grid operator responsible for docking. "Now we need to focus on epidemic prevention and control, and we also need to focus on resuming work. If we only consider resuming work, if there is one case, then the factories will all be closed down, but if we only focus on epidemic prevention, many factories will surely die again, " he said.
Nervous electronics factories have to tread carefully. According to Wang, at present, only one person is allowed to eat at each table, two meters apart and facing the same direction, strictly forbidden to eat face to face. But the most important thing is the shortage of protective equipment after the resumption of work, the most scarce of which is still a mask.
Fortunately, because of the nature of circuit board production, employees are required to wear masks at work, so the factory's warehouse had 2,000 units in stock until this year. "these masks are for industrial use and can only be given to one person per day. I put in a material request to the management committee, the other side said that can report first, but there is no guarantee that can be resolved. You can't get it on the market now, and I guess they don't have it there either."
And companies are not alone in fretting about the difficulties of returning to work. Labour-intensive smes are particularly slow to return to work compared with large or capital-and technology-intensive firms. The smaller the enterprise, the lower the rate of return to work. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) , which monitors 2.4 million small and medium-sized enterprises using cloud and e-commerce platforms, has found that only about 30 percent of the country's small and medium-sized enterprises have returned to work. Among them, the flow of people blocked, funding difficulties, order delivery difficulties and industrial chain supporting difficult, become the main obstacles.
In order to facilitate the resumption of work, Wenzhou has abolished any form of resumption of work review and approval procedures. In Ouhai District's Wu Tian Street, all 111 anti-epidemic bayonets were changed into service stations overnight to ensure registration of workers returning to work and registration of enterprises returning to work.
Nevertheless, Wang still has a heavy burden on his mind.
"We had orders years ago and delivery was slow, so we planned to finish them years later, but we didn't expect such a big outbreak. There are more regular customers, but if you keep missing work and the customer is in a hurry to get the goods, then the orders must be lost,"he says worriedly.
If the outbreak lasts another two months, he estimates, many small factories that lost customers will have to close. "This year, " he said, a little wistfully, "it's not about how much money you make, it's about staying alive. "
Amid the same anxiety, the city of Rui'an, which is part of the city, has put out a notice saying that it will distribute five days'worth of protective materials free of charge to companies returning to work before the end of February if they are in short supply. Migrant workers who are employed and insured locally for the first time will receive 500-1,000 yuan. Yiwu, 200 kilometers away from Wenzhou, has also sent a number of chartered buses to rush to Yunnan, Hunan, Anhui and Gansu to "recruit and rob" workers Some Wenzhou factories have also been posting job postings online, offering free rides across the country and paying car fares in hopes of attracting more front-line workers. They don't want to be left to die.
Wang is still working hard for the resumption of work in the Electronics Factory. The factory's production lines are starting up, but the masks in stock won't last more than a few days. What happens after that? He doesn't know. But he kept on hiring -- as if the factory would be more promising if enough people returned to work.
