Here comes the rumor. Here comes the counterrumor. This time it's about a miracle drug.

Hope

"The patient improved by more than 90 per cent in 17-40 hours after RADZIVIR was administered. "

This is a drug being developed by Gilead, formerly known as Remdesivir. It arrived in China on February 4th. It is currently undergoing clinical trials in Wuhan.

A total of 761 patients were enrolled in the trial, including 308 mild and moderate cases, 453 severe cases. The patients were randomized (Placebo, full-dose, half-dose) and double-blind (doctors and patients did not know whether they were taking a drug or a placebo) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug.

The results are inconclusive. News of the drug's effectiveness has begun to circulate on social media. On the evening of February 6, Cao Bin, deputy director of the china-japan Friendship Hospital, responded to media interviews by clarifying that "the clinical study started today, how can we possibly know the results? " He and his team are mainly responsible for the clinical research plan. He stressed that scientific research takes time.

This is an official announcement to dispel rumors. That night, the tencent news team also received some information from close to the clinical trial staff, saying that the first patient in the Ridgeville trial had recovered from severe illness in less than 24 hours. However, it said in the article that, like patients in the United States who have been declared cured by the drug, they are now isolated cases, with no controlled trials and enough clinical samples to prove that a "wonder drug" worked.

Earlier, on January 31, the prestigious Medical Journal The New England Journal of Medicine (Nejm) published a paper on the diagnosis and treatment of the first confirmed case in the United States, noting that the patient's condition improved rapidly after taking Ridgeville as an experimental treatment, body temperature dropped from 39.4 to 37.3 degrees Celsius. SATS range from 94% to 96% .

It is worth noting, however, that the study did not provide data on changes in viral load in the peripheral blood before and after, that there was no rigorous evidence of a direct drug-related symptom reduction, and that the patient's 12th day nasal test was still positive for the virus, does Not yet meet the national criteria for cure.

There is no vaccine, there is no cure. It is still a glimmer of hope.

By 2400 hours on February 6, the COVID-19 had reported more than 30,000 confirmed cases and more than 26,000 suspected cases. "Tsinghua AI team" dynamics model predicted that the number of national infection will reach a peak in February 12-19, February 16 around the inflection point, the highest cumulative number of confirmed cases of 42,000-60,000.

In an interview with Bai Yansong on the evening of Feb. 5, Chinese Academy of Engineering, a respiratory and critical care specialist, said that based on preliminary results, they had high hopes for Radzivir, and, of course, the ultimate efficacy of clinical observation. Previously, the china-japan Friendship Hospital has said that the clinical research technology for the end of April 27.

Program

According to international practice, before a new drug is released to the public, it has to go through animal experiments and four stages of Phase I, II and III clinical trials in "human beings" . The first two steps verify safety, the last two steps verify efficacy. Landed in China, Ridgway skipped Phase I and II clinical trials and went straight to phase III.

The drug, originally developed to treat Zaire Ebolavirus, has previously been shown to inhibit both Atypical pneumonia and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) in vitro and in animal models. Chinese researchers have also found that the antiviral activity of Redoxivir against COVID-19 is also good at the cellular level.

Lucy Liu, a new Drug Review Committee member at the State Drug Administration, has said publicly that it takes at least six months for a new drug to go through the normal approval process. "In times of emergency, if the SFDA takes special care to speed up the approval process, Ridgeville may only conduct three hundred clinical trial in the country and be able to obtain import approval as soon as one or two months. "

Despite the urgency of the public on new drugs and vaccines, the laws and standards of drug development can not be overstepped. Dr. Zhong Nanshan made it clear that clinical trials could speed up the green path, but that procedures must be followed, "A lot of labs get a head start and they want to go into the clinic right away, " he said. "Be careful. The ethical review has to go through. The clinician has to follow clinical protocol. ".

In 2003, during the period of SARS, China issued the regulations on dealing with public health emergencies and later adopted the law on dealing with public health emergencies. In 2005, the special examination and approval procedures of the State Food and Drug Administration were promulgated and put into effect, which clearly stipulated the management of examination and approval of drugs in case of public health emergencies, the principle of "no reduction in standards and procedures" is required to complete the pharmacological and toxicological studies and Phase III clinical trials.

Up to now, our country has not formed the similar other country's "compassionate medication" mechanism. On December 1,2019, the newly revised "Drug Administration Law" is regarded as the legal basis for establishing the system of "compassionate use of drugs" in principle.

Its Article 23 provides that for the treatment of seriously life-threatening diseases for which no effective treatment is available and for drugs of urgent public health need for which data from interim clinical trials have been available to show efficacy and to predict clinical value, it may be approved with conditions, and the relevant matters may be stated in the drug registration certificate.

However, there has not been a complete set of implementation methods for the implementation of landing. Some media analysis that, in the current situation of severe epidemic situation, can only hope that special events may be done.

Patent

On the evening of February 4, the day the drug arrived in China, the Official Journal of the Wuhan Institute of Virology said, "We filed a Chinese invention patent (for use against the 2019 COVID-19) on January 21 in accordance with international practice and from the perspective of protecting national interests, and will enter major countries in the world through the PCT (patent cooperation agreement) route for the drug, which is not yet listed in China and has intellectual property barriers. "

For a time, "Red Xiwei" by the Wuhan Virus Research Institute "Rush To Patent Invention, " the short message spread widely. On the issue of patent disputes, Cheng Fang, a property rights lawyer at Zhonglun Law Firm, responded to "business people" by saying that the same drug can have multiple patents at the same time, and the Wuhan Virus Research Institute can apply for patents, its application is the use of the patent ridgeville compounds, is a second-class patent.

In the industry, chemical drugs are often divided into first-class patents, which usually refer to patents that protect pharmaceutical compounds, and second-class patents, which refer to a series of patents that derive from pharmaceutical compounds, the invention comprises a pharmaceutical composition, a pharmaceutical use, a preparation method, a crystal structure, etc. .

In response to the patent issue, Gilead CEO Danyll said the priority is to find the right clinical trial program for Ridgway, increase productivity, and not get involved in a patent battle.

On March 1,2019, O<sup>â€²</sup>Dea took over as chairman and CEO of Gilead from his position as head of Roche. Gilead's revenue had fallen for three years in a row, and its stock price had fallen from a peak of $130 to $63. O'day is charged with change and transformation, and a change in leadership is a key part of his 2019 campaign.

Gilead reported revenue of $22.49 billion for 2019, up 1.5 percent from the previous year. Revenue from AIDS products totaled $16.438 billion, up 12 percent from the previous year and accounting for 73.32 percent of the company's revenue, it closed at $2.936 billion, down 20 percent from a year earlier.

For now, Gilead is also benefiting from further expansion in the Chinese market. With the approval of Hepatitis B drug Vemlidy in China, Gilead achieved 52% growth. The company expects Vemlidy to generate $1 billion in revenue by 2022 as it penetrates the U.S. market and pulls in China. Since 2017, Gilead has approved eight drugs and added four new ones to the national health insurance list.

Gilead, the world's most innovative biopharmaceutical company, now has $25.02 BN IN R & D, a return of $175bn, not counting the value of its products. In 2018, Gilead got 60% of its revenue from new drugs. Historically, Gilead's new drugs have been a blockbuster for two or three years.

Inflection point

It took Gilead less than 30 years to become one of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in the world. It was founded in 1987, headquartered in foster city, California, the United States, has been known as the "Pharmaceutical Industry Apple. ". Of the 11,000 employees in the world, there are about 6,000 R & D personnel, accounting for nearly 55% , and less than 3,000 sales and marketing personnel.

Founder Mikell holds a Bachelor of science in Chemistry from the University of Washington, a doctorate in medicine from the Johns Hopkins University, and an MBA from Harvard business school. After graduation, he joined Menlo Ventures, a venture capital firm based in Monroe. In 1987, at the age of 29, he resigned to found Gilead. For five years, Gilead was neither profitable nor profitable, relying entirely on Revordan's fund-raising success.

In 1988, $2 million; in 1989, $10 million; in 1991, $40 million; in 1992, $86 million; in 1995, $94 million through the stock market; in 1996, Gilead finally had vistede, its first drug, gilead raised nearly $250 million from the stock market.

Capital and listing are Gilead's first inflection point. In 1997, he brought in Martin to take over as CEO. After that, Gilead launched nearly 10 large-scale mergers and acquisitions, the completion of AIDS, hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and other pharmaceutical sector layout. The fact proves, acquired project also basically became"cash cow"later.

When the company was founded, Gilead signed an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline to develop "antisense" drugs to treat genetic diseases. In 1998, Jilly ended his partnership with Glaxo, selling the intellectual property of the "antisense" drug and the oncology business to two other drug companies, and focusing on antiviral drug research and development.

It was Gilead's second inflection point -- a defining strategic stage and core business, becoming a company specializing in AIDS, hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and infectious diseases. Gilead's sales have increased thousands of fold over the past few decades, including the Hepatitis C drug Sofosbuvir, the AIDS drug Betadine and the popular flu drug Duffy, gilead has repeatedly rewritten the course of treatment for major human diseases.

But in recent years it, too, is facing a crisis. Once the First Minister of Hepatitis C drug business shrinking rapidly, HIV drugs encountered a giant strong chase, the stock price fell. And its heavily-funded Zaire ebolavirus drug, Radzivir, has failed to deliver the expected clinical results. Until now, Ridgway has not been approved for listing in any country in the world.

"there seems to have been a particularly critical 'deterioration' in several cases of surviving or unfortunate deaths... the American cure was given in the case of a sudden deterioration, " Yan Ning, a structural biologist, said in a statement posted on Weibo, it is too early to say if ridgway is effective against the new crown, given the only case so far, which is not statistically significant.

Of course, both the public and Gilead are expecting an inflection point.
