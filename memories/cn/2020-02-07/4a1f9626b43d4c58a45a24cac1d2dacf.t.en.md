Speaking of Fang Fang the day before yesterday, she was told today that she had been silenced for 14 days, the same amount of time as in isolation. Her Personal Weibo Account, which has no voice, continues to record on Wechat's public account.

These two days Wuhan Change Day again, the temperature drops suddenly, the finger is frozen red when holding an umbrella, the spring idea that accumulates finally, be again by acrid cold fight back, dissipate.

Since the announcement of door-to-door Inspection and temperature measurement in Wuhan, my classmate has become more nervous. Her wisdom teeth have become a little inflamed these days. She takes temperature in the morning and at night, and sometimes she has a low-grade fever, but often she has a slight fever in the morning and returns to normal in the evening, maybe it's psychological. But if her home temperature catches up with her fever, she might have to register with the community and send her to a central quarantine. She did not want to live in a shelter hospital, where conditions were poor and there was a fear that if she went in, she would not come out. "The priority for the establishment of the hospital is the people on the outside, not the people on the inside, " she said, although photos and videos were posted to prove that conditions in the hospital were good, living conditions are not too bad, follow-up materials and management will follow, the two of us are still clear-cut, do not go, is [ silencer ] .

I received an email from my school yesterday asking me to submit a motivation letter by Friday. The application system needed to be over the wall. I opened my laptop, which was filled with water, and buried it in a rice bag for more than 10 days, it just magically turned on and worked. I jumped to my feet in a moment of excitement and took a photo to send to my mother with the good news, along with several lines of "AH AH AH" exclamations. All morning, my chest was filled with "God has eyes" Ecstasy.

I started to write the supplementary materials last night. I wrote half of them, and I intend to write the rest today. I will transfer the layout to PDF and upload them. Only 62% of the updated Japanese dramas on the Internet have been downloaded. I am reluctant to close the LID, thought I'd finally be able to watch youtube videos on my computer tomorrow morning (I've been using my cell phone for a few days now, the screen is small, and my eyes hurt from watching it for too long) .

I didn't expect to open the computer again this morning, everything went back to the beginning, the switch was unresponsive, the screen was black, occasionally there was a bright light, my heart suddenly fell to the bottom, just was thrown into the clouds, did not feel the sky well, was thrown down without mercy, heavily smashed into the mud, head first, head first, head first, head first, head first. What about the half-written material, which has to be uploaded today, with no backup and no way to get over the wall, the only thing you can use is a brick machine that will jam in Chinese and delay the video subtitles and sound by more than 10 seconds. I feel so bad, my mother and I sent Wechat, said it might as well be a straight sentence to death, a knife in Slow slicing is my heart, only 24 hours of false hope, let my heart filled with joy to usher in a void.

Emotional turmoil over personal matters has yet to be digested, and another wave of wailing over Dr. Li Wenliang has swept in. Last night, before going to bed, about 9:30 in the micro-blog to read the content of his death, I also forwarded the message, "hope this is only false rumors, " this morning at five o'clock, the phone is full of mourning his death, each one hit me in the heart, i couldn't help crying loudly in bed, crying the short and tragic life of Dr. Li Wenliang, crying every ordinary person trapped in this city, we can still hold a candle when it is dark, after the Dawn, all of this will be quietly erased.

In the quilt to cry dazed, barely stopped tears (told myself to cry down eyes swollen to open) , while eating breakfast, and again silent tears, I did not cry out loud, every time I can not help but make a little noise, immediately put some food into my mouth to stop up, because I know my parents can not really understand and empathy, at most, comfort me a few words, advised that things do not change. I sometimes hate myself not cold-hearted enough, what things have to cry a few, if the heart has seen the world, the practice of invulnerability, as hard as stone, perhaps do not have to self-guilt in the repeated torture.

This was followed by the aforementioned laptop strike two, which struck me as "spring seems to be an illusion, " even though the start of spring is not until mid-to-late March, it's even later where we go north. After seven or eight o'clock, the circle of friends also slowly woke up. People all paid tribute to Dr. Li Wenliang. At first, I also posted a message, which was deleted after more than 10 minutes. I had a hunch that the contents would be subject to discussion and argumentation from friends and colleagues. The mood now is not suitable for theory, maybe if we don't get along, I can go back to fighting.

After reading Dr. Li Wenliang's micro blog, the ordinary and trivial daily life made me continue to cry, and I couldn't stop wiping with my hands. I turned off my mobile phone and tried to escape from the tsunami of emotion that was about to burst out, but my mind was still full of his story, pictures and text from other bloggers, and a song you can't listen to. My fingers, mechanically, numbly pressed a few buttons on my laptop, tried to recover my laptop from the Internet Post, "what if my MacBook doesn't work with a black screen? ".

Try All the key combinations are useless, perhaps yesterday's boot is just a reflection, the computer experience and Dr. Li Wenliang's death was somehow linked to me, overlap. I have tried very hard to save it, but I still can't save it, I still don't want to believe that the computer is completely broken, with the vague hope that it might be able to recover, and Dr. Li Wenliang, who "can not die / Can Not die as expected and can not die as required, " What's the difference. The photo went viral on Weibo: A man stamping words in the snow in memory of Dr. Li Wenliang. The last exclamation mark was made by him lying on the ground. I suddenly felt like falling straight down, too. I fell in the snow and made some marks.

Let us not forget that on the night of February 6th, we are beams of light, the road we have traveled is bright, behind us is dark, the darkness can easily swallow the light, but the light can not change the darkness, it can only illuminate this part of the road, when the light is gone, it is still dark, and we have to gather more light and twist it into a brilliant beam to light up the wider area.

Wish Dr. Li Wenliang can go to a better world, with crispy fried chicken legs, cheap cherubs, hot eggs and cakes, and a sequel to the celebration of the Lunar New Year, with all the good things waiting for him.
