Ask a few friends who are also sealed in the community, since the big year twenty-nine to the present, what is the feeling in the heart, the answer is "Numb, do not know what feeling, I do not know, a bit blocked up" , I have the same feeling, the more later the more numb, passively adapted to the life of a closed city.

The initial inconveniences, now can come up with solutions, once felt difficulties, and now slowly overcome. Look on the bright side, the hard days are over, there will be no insurmountable obstacles, look on the bad side, the exception to the norm, I have no choice but to become one of them.

The more strict, short two days issued several orders, now in addition to medical, commercial super, logistics and other special workers, all other personnel are not allowed to go out, even if there is a work unit resume certificate also do not recognize the account. Today, I went to the Property Office to get vegetables, the side door was strictly guarded by six staff members. An old man also wanted to go out. He quarreled for a long time at the door. Later, the staff said that there are now patrols on the street, even if he is let out, i was stopped by a patrol and had to be persuaded to return without proof. Some people on the internet said they would be taken to the gymnasium for centralized quarantine. I haven't received this notice yet. The gymnasium has been changed into a shelter hospital. There is no room for people running around.

It is believed that many people in Wuhan are almost desperate. Yesterday, Free Baocai was distributed in residential areas. A family could get up to three pieces of Baocai. Most of the Baocai were wilted and yellow. At ordinary times, it was the crooked melon and split dates that rarely came into contact with in the supermarket vegetable market. No one is now picking them up, as long as it is fresh vegetables on the line, cabbage also storable, the balcony can be put for 10 days and half a month.

When I saw the notice, I put on a mask and went downstairs. I thought I was going fast enough, but I underestimated the boredom of the residents being cooped up at home. Many people just went downstairs in their pajamas and slippers. A middle-aged man in front of me stood aside after receiving the cabbage. The property staff told him that he could not take more than three vegetables from each family. The man was holding three vegetables in his arms and quickly nodded to clarify, "stay at home for more than 20 days, sitting lying down can not stand, rarely downstairs, let me breathe, " he said as he moved out, the property heard no longer say anything, buried in the hair. When I walked to see more than a few men, he stood in the property door, the body of a small swing from side to side, carrying cabbage in hand, and holding a child like, eyes to side door direction, do not know what to think.

For the convenience of shopping, I added a few delivery boys to Wechat, they are one of the few people still able to travel freely, now can not go out, online orders more and more, more and more heavy, often a single packet. They deliver from morning to night, the trunk of a heavy stuffed, to the residents of the community sent all food, they have no chance to eat, because not many masks, one a day, also have to save.

I was talking to a delivery guy, and I gave him a red envelope, saying, "thank you so much for buying food and delivering food in the storm. " He never responded. I was worried, "did you get picked up by the patrol on the way here? Be careful. " It took him a long time to order it, said he had too many orders and didn't have time to check his phone. First thing in the morning, you have to get up early to fix your bike, the motorcycle has trouble when it runs too much, fix it, go to the community to open a certificate, then go to the supermarket to help buy food, after buying a single item and delivering it, many neighborhoods won't even let you put it at the door, if you have to call someone to come down and get it, he has to stand at the door, when the residents change their clothes and wear masks, it is often more than 10 or 20 minutes.

Over the past two days, there have been a few news items. After reading them, they are very sad. They are all tragedies of the family's passing away. When exactly can we see the truly gratifying good news? Every day is a critical time for epidemic prevention. How many people are discharged from the hospital and how many people are cured, the data from other provinces has been falling for several times. The data from outer space is hanging in the air. I am skeptical. I do not dare to be overly optimistic. I am afraid that it is a false hope. I also think it is all general talk, and it is difficult to put into practice the propaganda techniques.

Whenever I see such reports, I ask myself, "and I, and Hubei Wuhan how much of a relationship" , "our situation has improved" , "the response of the problem is solved one by one? ". In the face of the epidemic prevention war of coronavirus, there is no such thing as "winning" or "not winning" . If the virus loses to us, it has nothing to lose. If we lose to the virus (although we will "win" in the end no matter what) , our losses are unimaginable. In contrast to several defeats in Chinese history, Qin said, "in the face of disease and natural disasters... human beings always win, and as winners, they can not ask for "freedom" from the virus, nor can they obtain compensation and territory from the virus. ". Since we can not claim compensation from the virus, then the measure of the "Battle of the Bulge" that we pay the price, is at all costs, or to the minimum.

Sex Appeal and disease are the two main themes of the body, "The opposite of disease isn't health, it's sex. Illness is a private matter, it is introverted, it is ambushed by individuals, it is both dangerous and sad, it has to be bound again and again in the context of their own loneliness; the sexy body is loud, it is excited, it can rush out of their narrow territory, at any time to let the body in the sexual atmosphere, i can not buy food and eat one or two meals every day. I am only thankful that I can still eat fresh food at home. I am also more aware of the importance of keeping healthy. I see that many girls on Weibo still persist in losing weight, we still struggle with the numbers on the scale, we still care whether our bodies are perfect or not, but we have suffered the double blow of the siege and the epidemic, i feel myself to the outward appearance and the body's toleration several cents again, treasures the hard-won health, cherishes protects me to breathe freely and the movement body.

The unit finally got the certificate of resumption of work and today officially resumed its work. The colleagues originally had high morale and welcomed the production mobilization and work deployment after the festival, "receive property notice, the entire floor needs to be cleaned today, the office should not be left with too many people, please all departments according to the arrangement to step by step" , a notice of human resources, also douses colleagues'enthusiasm to resume work (although in the mind does not want to go to the unit, is afraid to gather spreads) .

Now want to return to work is also difficult, first regional epidemic prevention headquarters approved, approved then to the property approved, the property approved also had to kill daily cleaning, good records. Today a colleague reaction, only allow 15-20 people in and out of the company every day, have to apply for the list in advance, not in the list of personnel not allowed to enter, after communication can be a collective access card, we take the pass, ID card, work to and from work. If there is an outbreak, no one wants to take responsibility, a floor case, the entire office block, the entire company to accept quarantine. Local and enterprise in the resumption of work and stand-by dilemma, not only to protect indicators and performance, and fear of an epidemic, can only "step by step, gradually, conditional" resumption of work.

As a dog owner and cat owner, I really can't watch a video of beating a dog and torturing a cat. I made it clear long ago that cats and dogs are not contagious. I also threw cats and dogs, or beat a house cat and dog to death. Once I slipped and accidentally opened the video, heard the puppy purr for mercy, heart-broken. However, there are also many people who care about small animals. I have posted some pictures of stray cats on Weibo. Yesterday, a girl sent me a private message saying that an orange cat with a white glove looks like her cat. It was placed in a foster home at a friend's house during the Chinese New Year. It ran away when the window was open for ventilation, unfortunately, our last addresses did not match up. The address was too far away from each other to be the same cat. She said that after the cat was lost, she had searched every day on Weibo in the same city in Wuhan for key words one by one. In the past four or five days, the hope of finding the cat was rather slim, but she said she would keep looking, hoping the girl would get her cat back.

It seems that the notice to resume work after the 20th will not be delayed any longer. This week, at the latest, is over, and it is not known when cross-provincial traffic will resume, the "self-defeating" outcome has left the city weakened, the epidemic temporarily contained (perhaps because we co-exist with the virus) , and other deep wounds waiting to heal.

"All my life I have done my duty for my son, my father, my husband, my wife, and my people. Farewell, my beloved and my beloved. ".
