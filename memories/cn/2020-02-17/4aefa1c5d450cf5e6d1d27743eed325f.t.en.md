Today's medical history is tomorrow's medical history

Press
On New Year's Eve, the first medical team of 136 medical workers from Shanghai rushed to Wuhan. The author, Renji Hospital, has worked in the intensive care unit of Gintan hospital since Jan. 24. In the completion of high-intensity, busy and difficult medical work, she insisted on keeping a diary of his daily work experience and perception, which is undoubtedly the most true anti-epidemic front.


Day  3
29 patients, mostly hard cases on suction.

At 6 a.m. on January 27, the alarm clock went off before dawn.
The drive from the hotel to the hospital was empty, with no pedestrians, except for the 10 or so doctors we had hurried past. We followed Zheng Junhua leader, Zhou Xin director, Chen Dechang together to the North 3 floor of the Intensive Care Unit, into the ward outside the doctor's office, began the busy work.

As the situation is very serious, we put on overalls after the start of non-stop shift. Currently, most of the 29 patients in the ward are hard cases who are hooked up to the machines. Yesterday's busy night shift, Ward has a critical patient died because of ineffective rescue, which makes us feel the pressure and responsibility.

After a brief shift, all the doctors discussed the treatment plan for the critically ill patients admitted to the ward and the problems existing in the current work, and arranged the next work arrangement. Next is ward round in groups. Our Group 1 is led by Director Chen Dechang. Hand Sanitizers, hats, shoe covers, gloves, hand sanitizers, disposable protective clothing... the whole process takes about 20 minutes.

My team covers three I.C.U.'s, 10 patients in all. Walks into the ward, in all is on the non-invasive aspiration machine patient. One patient seemed to know that a Shanghai specialist would be in charge of their care, so he held out great hope. He said he has been here for many days, but still does not feel better, and hopes that the Shanghai medical staff can save him. We tried to reassure the patient that he was going to be OK, that he was going to be OK.

At the same time, we according to the parameters on the patient ECG monitor, the parameters of the breathing machine made some adjustments. During the rest of the rounds, each patient we encountered was critically ill, the only difference being the degree. Another John doe was picked up by the on-call doctor last night, brought in unconscious from hypoxia. After a night of intensive care by the night shift doctors, the patient has regained consciousness and is able to answer some of our simple questions. The search for his family is also under way and can not be relaxed for a moment.

Day  4
Over 85% of the ward is critically ill, and the rest is critically ill.

January 28 was the fourth day of aid to Hubei, and the work was gradually getting on track.

Today, I was on day shift. At the end of my shift, the assistant team leader did a patient count. There are now dozens of patients in the entire ward: more than 85% critically ill, the rest critically ill. At present the medical team hopes to be able to carry out tracheal intubation and other operations, to do more to save the lives of patients. However, the reality is that these operations can not be carried out without concern that safeguards are not in place.

Director Chen Dechang asks us to learn tracheal intubation and deep vein puncture in the morning, hope that besides the doctor of intensive care unit, aspiration doctor also can be on duty at any time.

Zhou Xin director said, if the protection is in place, the first case of INTUBATION, he came!

Today after rounds with the patient's family to report the situation by telephone, carry on the doctor-patient communication. Bed 7 is a middle aged man in critical condition, his wife asked the doctor on the phone, said she is not afraid of infection, hope to be able to accompany the patient; there are also patients'family members to answer the phone to inform themselves are also quarantined; there are also said not to want to increase the patient's pain, ... Give up on... The world is a warm and cold place.

Day 6
Our team leader criticized us for the death of a patient.

January 30, the sixth day of aid to Hubei.

Roommate worked the night shift at 2:00 a.m. last night, and I was asleep when she left. I was worried that roommate would be late for work and wake up to find that it was after 2 a.m. and there was no one in her bed. She's GonNa be in isolation for at least six hours, and she might come out once, but she's GonNa have to change into a hazmat suit. In order to save the protective clothing, the medical staff generally do not eat, do not drink, do not go to the toilet. At the end of the day, N95 masks and hats can leave deep marks on your face.

Before work, roommate said she wanted all her patients to be healthy. Unfortunately, when I woke up this morning, I was told by a group of doctors that one of her bed patients had passed away and that she needed to take care of the follow-up. I was really worried for her: the young girl was not a communist, just because Hubei was her hometown, just because she chose to care for the profession, after receiving the notice of Hubei Aid, she took the initiative to "fight. ". As soon as she arrived in Wuhan, she blocked her parents from her friends'circle, just because she didn't want to worry them.

At noon, I got the news from the group, because of the death of the patient, our group members were criticized by the group leader. The more I understand that leaders are under as much pressure as we are. We had a 12 hour night shift, with no food, no water, no toilet, and about three hours of shift work and death cases, and 15 hours of hard work that no one could handle. All of us work in lockstep to save as many lives as possible, but..

Many comrades in the Medical Corps work with diseases. Our team leader Liu was diagnosed with diabetes two months ago and was extremely cautious in his diet. He just arrived in Wuhan that two days, for fear of blood sugar control do not dare to eat, and to eat must first find water to eat medicine, or do not dare to eat.

Day  8
The Shanghai medical team completed the first intubation and ECMO

February 1, the eighth day of aid to Hubei.

We have a new critically ill patient in our group, 44 years old, but very sick. Director Chen Dechang said that if the patient's condition changes and he needs to be intubated, inform him and he will intubate.

Finally, Director Chen and several ICU specialists of our team stayed in the isolation ward for several hours and completed the first endotracheal intubation and ECMO operation of the Shanghai medical team in Wuhan, i am deeply proud of the Shanghai medical team.

In the afternoon, in our first group, there was one more piece of news: our patient in bed 19, distraught with illness, pulled off his suction mask and grabbed the nurse's isolation suit. It's a very dangerous thing to do. If the suit is torn and the doctor is exposed to the contaminated area, there is a high risk of infection. Fortunately, he was cared for by a male nurse, who was in good health, and who did not have much strength because of the long illness. Fortunately, the yellow isolation clothes the nurse wore were of better quality, and no accident occurred. Six paramedics were there in time to help calm him down.

Indeed, many patients in the ICU experience pain, anxiety, restlessness, or sleep disturbances. In the last few days, the patient has been showing signs of anxiety and agitation, and we have given him anti anxiety and sedative drugs, but because of the change in his condition, his blood pressure has dropped, so the dose has been reduced, which is what happens in Surprise.

Day  10
We've got incoming on the vacated four beds, Young Woman in her 30s, critical.

February 3rd, the 10th day of aid to Hubei. Today is the day shift.

At the end of the shift in the morning, Professor Zhou Xin suddenly asked us a question: "Do you know the procedure of transferring patients? " We looked at each other.

In retrospect, it seems that so far, we haven't had patients transferred out of our ward, only others have been moving them into critical care. Professor Zhou gave us a detailed account of the process of transporting patients, and then said, "soon you will need to use it. " This simple sentence contains too much positive information, let everybody already very exhausted body and mind suddenly invigorate.

Because there are ECMO patients in the ward, we all put forward, let Professor Chen Dechang give you training ECMO knowledge. After all, there were plenty of other doctors in the respiratory department besides the ICU, and we all had the same thirst for knowledge. According to the head nurse, their nursing team has begun to teach ECMO care, otherwise the ECMO specialist nurses are too hard. I suddenly remembered that Wu Wensan, a nurse in intensive care unit (ICU) of Yan Chai Hospital, was a specialist in ECMO. The intensity of his work really hurt us. Although those who can do more work, but also pay attention to the body AH!

For the treatment of patients with ECMO, single-use screen can not meet the protection requirements. So before entering the ward, we are required to wear goggles, and then wear a layer of disposable face screen. To reduce the fog, we wet our goggles with iodophor before wearing them, so our goggles are yellow. It took half an hour to complete the process. The pungent smell of Betadine, two layers of airtight protective clothing, two layers of medical surgical masks over the N95 mask, and the relative blurred vision make it difficult for us to work in full gear.

Into the isolation ward, found just before the empty four beds have been transferred patients. It was a young woman in her 30s who was breathing fast, her heart rate was racing, and she was in critical condition. After discussion, director Chen decided to give her tracheal intubation, by me to do professor Chen's assistant. I was in a state of agitation, in a sultry suit, and I was busy getting ready to intubate, and soon I was all sweaty.

A complete set of operations to do, and so take off protective clothing, put on a new mask and hat, it is 1:00 p.m. Every one of us was wet from hair to clothes, clinging to his body. At this moment, I really admire those nurses who work in isolation ward for a long time, really hard! I asked my former colleague at Ecmo what it was like, and his answer was "heatstroke. ".

There is certainly no time to eat, a lot of overdraw after the physical strength of no appetite to eat. It was four o'clock in the afternoon before I recovered from the fatigue of a hard day's work and was able to eat my lunch.

Just then, the good news came from the group: The patient in bed 29 was being transferred to the ICU. After these days of aggressive treatment, his condition has improved significantly, maintaining oxygen saturation at 95% without oxygen, and a 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test was negative, and hormone and antibiotic therapy was discontinued. One more negative nucleic acid test, and he'll be out and about. No wonder he thanked us during my rounds and said he would write a thank you note to our medical team.

Day  11
Bed 5 patient, 65-year-old she is killed by abominable pneumonia!

February 4, the Eleventh Day of aid to Hubei.

Middle Shift today. Six hours without food, water, or toilet. Although they can withstand physical and mental fatigue, empathy for patients and their families is always frustrating. We had a middle aged man in bed 6, and when the patient's family called, I told her that the patient was not well and had multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

The patient's sister was on the phone, and her mother was being treated at the hospital. She wanted us to try to save bed 6, and I gently told her to be prepared.

Our five beds were gone, fast, and my heart broke when I heard the sobs of the family on the other end of the phone.

A 60-year-old woman with a post-op infection from rectal cancer didn't die of cancer, but was killed by this nasty new coronary pneumonia.

The woman on the other end of the line was crying and asking why? Why? But he was quarantined in another hospital, unable to see her one last time, and their daughter and son-in-law could not come to Hangzhou, so they had to entrust a relative to help with the related matters.

How many families have experienced this kind of pain in this new outbreak of pneumonia!

Today is the beginning of Spring, I think: No winter can not pass, no spring can not arrive! Will summer be far behind when spring comes? I am looking forward to seeing the Cherry Blossoms of Wuhan University, the busy traffic on the streets of Wuhan, and the beautiful view of the Yangtze River from Yellow Crane Tower

Day  12
Could not help shedding tears, not for their own hard work, only for the pain experienced by the people of Wuhan.

February 5, the 12th day of aid to Hubei.

I'm working the night shift from 6:00 to 8:00 tomorrow morning, which is 14 hours, so I need to rest up at the hotel and get my strength back.

After lunch, I'd like to go outside and bask in the Sun. Spring really arrived, I saw the roadside yellow grass has emerged in the Silk Green, early Sakura in the tree half is a flower, half already in full bloom. Pink Flowers, green grass... Spring in the branches has been ten, I suddenly filled with joy.

After lunch, I chatted with Dr. Yu, who was a colleague of Yan Chai Hospital in Wuhan, and learned that they were also very, very hard. He worked the day shift yesterday, from morning till half past ten, and in the middle he had only time for breakfast. The strong work pressure and the mental pressure, let him appetite become very bad. After more than 10 hours, his face has been pressed by N95 mask deep indentation, and even has a pressure sore on the bridge of his nose.

Today he is also the night shift, but today he rushed to the hospital during the day, to finish what he did not finish yesterday. He said that when a reporter interviewed him this morning, he couldn't help but shed tears, not for his own hard work, but only for the pain the people of Wuhan experienced.

Today, he works 12-hour nights, I work 14-hour nights, and we cheer each other on and wish each other good luck. Help each other, we work together in Wuhan Night!

Day  14
Yesterday's intubation was done by new Director Zhou, who is in his 60s.

February 7, the 14th day of aid to Hubei, Wuhan Cloudy Day.

From last night to today, the circle of friends was saddened by the death of Dr. Lee and felt aggrieved by the whole process of the incident. Dr. Lee is a hero, but I guess he does not want to be a hero, just a happy ordinary people.

The dead are not afraid to take responsibility. We are also ordinary people, and we have to do is remember this "ordinary" hero, shoulder our mission and responsibility as a doctor, continue to forge ahead.

Last night, I learned from the Jiao Tong University School of Medicine that the father of a clinical medical student was infected with COVID-19 pneumonia. The girl, Xiao Q, from Wuhan, returned home during the winter vacation and her father contracted new coronary pneumonia (a mild case, fortunately, and was admitted yesterday to the Shelter Hospital of the Wuhan Convention and Exhibition Center in Hankou) . More than 10 days ago, Q  himself began to have a fever, chest CT examination is no problem, now q has fever, in addition to a little sleepy, no other symptoms.

I took the initiative to contact the small Q, Comfort her, give her encouragement, but also in the professional guidance her. Although I can do very limited things, but I told her, she has the entire Shanghai Jiaotong University medical school teachers and students behind her, "We are always watching and supporting you. We hope you will be strong. And we hope you and your father will get well soon. " I am sure she will grow up to be a good doctor after this new crown disease.

At breakfast, I ran into Liu, the night shift leader of our group. He told me that new director Zhou did the TRACHEAL intubation yesterday. Director Zhou has more than 60 years old, is a respected professor, since the outbreak has been in the first line, his doctors benevolence let me admire.

Day  16
11 additional beds per floor to prepare for new patients. I've only had breakfast once in a dozen hours, and I feel like a camel.

February 9, the 16th day of aid to Hubei.

Today is the day shift, the first 10-hour day shift after the shift shift change.

Team leader Zheng Junhua through multiple contacts, and finally transferred from Shanghai Lung Hospital some nasal masks, two days later to the gold and Silver Tan hospital. When a non-invasive machine patient is feeding, he has to take off his mask and use a nasal Cannula, but for our critical patients, oxygen deprivation means that the disease can affect other organ functions, therefore, we suggest that it is best to change the patient to use a nasal mask when eating, so as not to affect the patient to eat, and will not cause the patient to be hypoxic for too long. Now the whole team wants to do is to improve the survival rate of critically ill patients, to think of patients, from all possible starting to solve the problem.

At noon, Zhou delivered the latest mission of the hospital: 11 extra beds per floor, ready to receive new patients. In the afternoon, the nurses are busy, bed, quilt, Oxygen Tank, oxygen meter head... . Everything has to be ready. Figured I'd have to take in patients tonight, and our night doctor's GonNa be busy.

It was dark outside when I got off work. When I got back to the hotel, I ate quickly. Dinner was only at 6:30 pm. I've only had one breakfast in a dozen hours. I feel like a camel, taking in lots of water and food when it's full, storing it in my body and using it when I need it.

More than 300 medical teams from Mount Hua and Ruijin hospitals will arrive in Wuhan today to take over the city's intensive care unit. The Circle of friends is filled with admiration and heartache for the medical staff. Yan Chai Hospital also issued an emergency call to prepare for possible follow-up departure. Many colleagues as ready to assist Wuhan's new blood, Wechat have asked me this old team member. I'll send you a list of all the supplies you'll need, including protective and household items, along with a few questions and caveats.

Day  17
Some patients said on the spot, his condition only need to be admitted to the Shelter Hospital, he does not want to live in our ward.

On February 10, the day after arriving in Wuhan, it was cloudy and rainy. Seventeen.

The nurses of the Shanghai Medical Team in the isolation ward of Jinyintan Hospital have changed their shifts from 6-8 hours to 4 hours. This is the head nurse from the transfer of light ward and Shanghai after the reinforcement of nurses have changed.

The four hours in the isolation ward were a physical ordeal, smothered in breathless gowns and protective clothing, and they always came out wet, with wet hair and deep masks carved into their faces. Four hours, they all had to leave an hour early, and it would take at least half an hour to get to the hospital, change and put on a protective suit. At 3:00 in the morning in the dead of night, they always travel together.

The new beds, which were added yesterday afternoon, are still taking in patients at night. Because of the limitations, only patients with severe new coronary pneumonia, that is, patients who only need oxygen and medication (in our eyes, they can only be regarded as light patients) . But even so, it adds a bit of pressure to the job. Newly admitted patients can only use cylinder oxygen, because the task suddenly, the Oxygen Cylinder Watch head is limited, the hospital has no time to transfer so many oxygen watch heads, so only one watch head can be connected with the double-way pipe, giving two patients oxygen at the same time, as a result, one cylinder does not have enough oxygen for one day, requiring the nurse to change it over and over again, which adds to the workload outside of nursing.

For critically ill patients, watching so many critically ill patients in bed, breathing through the breathing, there must be some psychological pressure. There was even a patient who said on the spot that he only needed to be admitted to a shelter hospital and that he didn't want to be in our ward. Well, the oxygen must be good for his condition.

These patients sit in the hallways of our isolation ward, breathing in oxygen, swiping their cell phones and watching our staff as they move, and it feels like a greater supervision of our work! Maybe, when the patient gets better and gets out of the hospital, he can write a book called "my days in isolation" ? !

Day  18
We never gave up on anyone, not even for a chance. But the patients in beds 18 and 19 died.

February 11, the 18th day of aid to Hubei.

Early in the morning, I got some bad news from the group: Our 18 bed and 19 bed patients had passed away. This let me finally pacify the mood, all of a sudden fell into depression.

Bed 18 is an 89-year-old man with underlying diseases. He has contacted his family several times to inform them that the prognosis is not good. But as medical staff, we do not give up, even if there is only a glimmer of life, we are also doing our best, with high-flow oxygen, non-invasive suction machines and other treatment measures, he died of respiratory failure and kidney failure, though.

The one step between life and death once again made me regret (a hard day) , even though we never gave up trying to save anyone.

It's the night shift. I need to get some sleep during the day to get my strength back. I wake up after nothing to do, do not want to read, do not want to brush Wechat, do not want to let their mood again ups and downs.

6:00 sharp. I'm one of three women on the night shift. In our ICU, only four of the more than 20 doctors are women. Today is the first day that three women are on duty at the same time, and we're under a lot of pressure. Two were from the suction department, and the other was a Chinese doctor. Dr. Zhuge Liang is the most nervous, I am the most calm, The Three Stooges, top of the Zhuge Liang. The three of US took a photo in front of the office as a memento, sending a friend circle -- Foshan -- THREE WOMEN ON DUTY! Let the people who care about US know they're okay.

I hope this night is special.

Day  19
"Shanghai Plan" to consider everything, feel after the night shift to fill up the spirit of food, sweep the night of fatigue.

February 12, the 19th day of aid to Hubei.

Three women will be on duty or good luck, in addition to sporadic handling of two incidents outside, it is really a night without distinction.

Dr. Zhou, who is on duty with me, is from the Level II hospital. She said that today is her first night shift alone in the intensive care unit in Wuhan. Her heart beats faster than ever. She was nervous about how to deal with things that happened during the night, and the other two of US consoled her together, the three of us, working together, helping each other. The first half of the night was spent quickly getting acquainted with new patients and reviewing old ones. The second half of the night, finally can have a good rest, the night of biting cold in the protection of cotton coat, heater disappeared without a trace.

At 8 o'clock, Director Xiong Weining, from the division of smoking in Shanghai's Ninth Hospital, gave a lecture on the subject of viral pneumonia. Director Xiong has already summed up the experience of patients'diagnosis and treatment some time ago, combining the experience of other leading doctors in the front line of the Wuhan Intensive Care Unit with the experience of ICU specialists in various hospitals in Wuhan in treating critically ill patients in the previous month and the experience of treating SARS in 2003, a set of rescue models for the critically ill patients with new coronary pneumonia in Shanghai medical team has been worked out for us, from the parameters of non-invasive aspiration pneumonia setting, the reasonable time of tracheal intubation, the right time of hormone use, the dosage and course of treatment of hormone, what types of patients use nasal masks, how to go offline, and so on. His "Shanghai Plan" to consider everything, feel after the night shift to replenish the full spirit of food, a sweep night of fatigue.

At the end of the lecture, Zheng Team stressed that our patients should have standardized treatment. Based on standardization, precise treatment requires further adjustment of aspiration parameters, attention to complications of mechanical ventilation and systemic organ function. In addition, we must pay attention to humanistic care, emphasizing that doctors care for patients in addition to physical diseases, but also to pay attention to the psychological changes of patients.

Today, the group posted a patient's diary, detailing his experience and journey after entering the isolation ward, the patient wrote: As a Wuhan resident, this epidemic is terrible, but at the same time, felt that the five lakes and four seas are one family, one side is in trouble, all sides support the human true feelings.

Day  20
Professor Zhou Xin in the tracheoscope under the guidance of Nasal intubation, Liu Group leader did not sleep all night.

February 13, the 20th day of aid to Hubei.

The two beds that were vacated yesterday were soon filled with new patients. One of the patients was admitted and had to be intubated because of his critical condition. Zhou was intubated by nose under the guidance of tracheoscope, but the patient developed severe acidosis and respiratory failure, which kept Liu, the night shift leader, awake all night, adjusting the parameters of the suction machine.

In order to save the patient's life, the medical staff will give him prone position ventilation today. The patient weighs about 200 catties, wearing layers of isolation clothes we feel powerless, the entire five medical staff spent nine strong effort, only carefully complete the patient's turn. Professor Zhou adjusted his breathing parameters again, hoping he would pull through.

Recalling that at this morning's meeting, Professor Chen said that the inflammatory storm caused by viral infection is different from the inflammatory storm caused by bacterial endotoxin, and that if fever occurs again during the course of the illness in critically ill patients with new pneumonia, which could indicate a poor prognosis for this patient. And yesterday, the patient's temperature was over 39 degrees Celsius, so it's unclear if he's GonNa make it, but none of us are willing to give up.

There's a new machine in the isolation ward: the Oxygen Machine. This is a donation from the care enterprise to our medical team. The team leaders, taking into account the need for extra beds in the wards, the need for oxygen inhalation for the critically ill patients, and the possibility of safety problems arising from the repeated replacement of oxygen cylinders, added four oxygen generators to each floor urgently, so as to be safe for the patients, and easier to care for.

Day  21
Ecstatic. The first patient in our ICU has been discharged!

February 14, Day twenty-one.

The office atmosphere is a bit depressing, the original intubation of the patient or died, Professor Chen's virus inflammation storm theory was again verified. The three doctors on duty in the ICU had a busy night last night and were unable to get back to work. Everything I could think of, everything I needed to do: tracheal intubation, invasive ventilation, prone position ventilation, lung recruitment... And yet, the virus is still so aggressive in taking patients away.

At the end of the shift... We have observed on the death of cases were analyzed and summarized: No Secretions of the Airway, unable to re-open the Alveoli, blood coagulation dysfunction, myocardial Zymogram increased, difficult to control blood pressure, fluid control...

Because from all the major hospitals in Shanghai, we all have their own team behind the plan, Zheng Junhua captain asked you for the treatment of whether there is a new idea. After everyone expressed their opinions, Zheng Team concluded the Treatment Direction: The first way is to be stable and strictly follow the guidelines, but it seems difficult to reduce the death rate of critically ill patients; the second way is to make steady progress, we can add potentially useful drugs to the guidelines; the Third Way is to take a risk and use some drugs if they save lives, but only if they have to go through a medical ethics review.

Good news today. The first patient in our ICU was discharged today. All of our patients have been transferred to the light ward since they got better. They were not discharged from our ward at the time of statistics. For the first time in more than 20 days, we feel the joy of patients discharged from hospital: When the patient raised his thumb, we feel ecstatic that all the pay is worth it.

We have a couple in ICU, beds 15 and 6, who are both in isolation with a new case of coronary pneumonia. The wife in bed 15 is heavier and requires noninvasive ventilation; the husband in bed 6 is lighter and receives oxygen. The timid 15 bed all needs the person to accompany, the night is the nurse to accompany, even goes to the toilet also is to call the nurse to stand outside, the day is 6 bed patient many times past to accompany.

Today is Valentine's Day, two people sit together, although no flowers, but one hand holding an apple, piously asked our nurses to take a group photo.

Day  23
First and second in the country! Thank you to the patients in beds 5 and 24 and their families for their decision.

February 16, day twenty-three.

Yesterday, when I switched off with the night shift, I told the shift doctor that the other patients in our group were all stable, but bed 5 was not in good condition, and the examination indexes in the afternoon were not very optimistic, you'd better ask the new Professor Zhou if you can adjust your medication when you make rounds tomorrow. As soon as I got dressed and went downstairs, I heard about the cardiac arrest in bed five. How is that possible? Before oxygen saturation and heart rate are good, I how also can not believe!

Shortly after 8:00 p.m. last night, a message was sent from our doctors'group: The family of bed 5 has agreed to an autopsy, and has signed it. What's going on? Is it true bed five is dead? Call the doctor on call. It's another cardiac arrest.

Bed 5 is an old gentleman, remember he has been more irritable, yesterday began to drowsiness, the family is ordinary people, there is nothing special.

At present, for the physiological and pathological changes caused by the new coronavirus, we are more based on clinical symptoms to infer, but there is no pathological basis. If the 5-bed family does agree to an autopsy, which would be the first in the country, the decision would be a major step forward in our understanding of NCP.

The decision was sudden, and the group was awestruck.

In the eyes of the Chinese who believe in being buried, the family members of bed 5 made a touching decision. Perhaps his decision will help us to study the pathogenicity and lethality of NCP and provide evidence for saving more severe cases of NCP in the future. This afternoon, we learned that bed 24's family has also agreed to perform an autopsy.

I can't tell you how grateful I am. The people of Wuhan, and indeed the people of China, should be grateful for the decision of the patients in beds 5 and 24 and their families. They should be grateful for the suffering of the people in Wuhan, for their selflessness and dedication behind their grief.

On New Year's Eve, the first medical team of 136 medical workers from Shanghai rushed to Wuhan. The author, Renji Hospital, has worked in the intensive care unit of Gintan hospital since Jan. 24. In the completion of high-intensity, busy and difficult medical work, she insisted on keeping a diary of his daily work experience and perception, which is undoubtedly the most true anti-epidemic front.

Day  3
29 patients, mostly hard cases on suction.

Day  3

29 patients, mostly hard cases on suction.

At 6 a.m. on January 27, the alarm clock went off before dawn.

The drive from the hotel to the hospital was empty, with no pedestrians, except for the 10 or so doctors we had hurried past. We followed Zheng Junhua leader, Zhou Xin director, Chen Dechang together to the North 3 floor of the Intensive Care Unit, into the ward outside the doctor's office, began the busy work.

As the situation is very serious, we put on overalls after the start of non-stop shift. Currently, most of the 29 patients in the ward are hard cases who are hooked up to the machines. Yesterday's busy night shift, Ward has a critical patient died because of ineffective rescue, which makes us feel the pressure and responsibility.

After a brief shift, all the doctors discussed the treatment plan for the critically ill patients admitted to the ward and the problems existing in the current work, and arranged the next work arrangement. Next is ward round in groups. Our Group 1 is led by Director Chen Dechang. Hand Sanitizers, hats, shoe covers, gloves, hand sanitizers, disposable protective clothing... the whole process takes about 20 minutes.

My team covers three I.C.U.'s, 10 patients in all. Walks into the ward, in all is on the non-invasive aspiration machine patient. One patient seemed to know that a Shanghai specialist would be in charge of their care, so he held out great hope. He said he has been here for many days, but still does not feel better, and hopes that the Shanghai medical staff can save him. We tried to reassure the patient that he was going to be OK, that he was going to be OK.

At the same time, we according to the parameters on the patient ECG monitor, the parameters of the breathing machine made some adjustments. During the rest of the rounds, each patient we encountered was critically ill, the only difference being the degree. Another John doe was picked up by the on-call doctor last night, brought in unconscious from hypoxia. After a night of intensive care by the night shift doctors, the patient has regained consciousness and is able to answer some of our simple questions. The search for his family is also under way and can not be relaxed for a moment.

Day  4
Over 85% of the ward is critically ill, and the rest is critically ill.

Day  4

Over 85% of the ward is critically ill, and the rest is critically ill.

January 28 was the fourth day of aid to Hubei, and the work was gradually getting on track.

Today, I was on day shift. At the end of my shift, the assistant team leader did a patient count. There are now dozens of patients in the entire ward: more than 85% critically ill, the rest critically ill. At present the medical team hopes to be able to carry out tracheal intubation and other operations, to do more to save the lives of patients. However, the reality is that these operations can not be carried out without concern that safeguards are not in place.

Director Chen Dechang asks us to learn tracheal intubation and deep vein puncture in the morning, hope that besides the doctor of intensive care unit, aspiration doctor also can be on duty at any time.

Zhou Xin director said, if the protection is in place, the first case of INTUBATION, he came!

Today after rounds with the patient's family to report the situation by telephone, carry on the doctor-patient communication. Bed 7 is a middle aged man in critical condition, his wife asked the doctor on the phone, said she is not afraid of infection, hope to be able to accompany the patient; there are also patients'family members to answer the phone to inform themselves are also quarantined; there are also said not to want to increase the patient's pain, ... Give up on... The world is a warm and cold place.

Day 6
Our team leader criticized us for the death of a patient.

Day 6

Our team leader criticized us for the death of a patient.

January 30, the sixth day of aid to Hubei.

Roommate worked the night shift at 2:00 a.m. last night, and I was asleep when she left. I was worried that roommate would be late for work and wake up to find that it was after 2 a.m. and there was no one in her bed. She's GonNa be in isolation for at least six hours, and she might come out once, but she's GonNa have to change into a hazmat suit. In order to save the protective clothing, the medical staff generally do not eat, do not drink, do not go to the toilet. At the end of the day, N95 masks and hats can leave deep marks on your face.

Before work, roommate said she wanted all her patients to be healthy. Unfortunately, when I woke up this morning, I was told by a group of doctors that one of her bed patients had passed away and that she needed to take care of the follow-up. I was really worried for her: the young girl was not a communist, just because Hubei was her hometown, just because she chose to care for the profession, after receiving the notice of Hubei Aid, she took the initiative to "fight. ". As soon as she arrived in Wuhan, she blocked her parents from her friends'circle, just because she didn't want to worry them.

At noon, I got the news from the group, because of the death of the patient, our group members were criticized by the group leader. The more I understand that leaders are under as much pressure as we are. We had a 12 hour night shift, with no food, no water, no toilet, and about three hours of shift work and death cases, and 15 hours of hard work that no one could handle. All of us work in lockstep to save as many lives as possible, but..

Many comrades in the Medical Corps work with diseases. Our team leader Liu was diagnosed with diabetes two months ago and was extremely cautious in his diet. He just arrived in Wuhan that two days, for fear of blood sugar control do not dare to eat, and to eat must first find water to eat medicine, or do not dare to eat.

Day  8
The Shanghai medical team completed the first intubation and ECMO

Day  8

The Shanghai medical team completed the first intubation and ECMO

February 1, the eighth day of aid to Hubei.

We have a new critically ill patient in our group, 44 years old, but very sick. Director Chen Dechang said that if the patient's condition changes and he needs to be intubated, inform him and he will intubate.

Finally, Director Chen and several ICU specialists of our team stayed in the isolation ward for several hours and completed the first endotracheal intubation and ECMO operation of the Shanghai medical team in Wuhan, i am deeply proud of the Shanghai medical team.

In the afternoon, in our first group, there was one more piece of news: our patient in bed 19, distraught with illness, pulled off his suction mask and grabbed the nurse's isolation suit. It's a very dangerous thing to do. If the suit is torn and the doctor is exposed to the contaminated area, there is a high risk of infection. Fortunately, he was cared for by a male nurse, who was in good health, and who did not have much strength because of the long illness. Fortunately, the yellow isolation clothes the nurse wore were of better quality, and no accident occurred. Six paramedics were there in time to help calm him down.

Indeed, many patients in the ICU experience pain, anxiety, restlessness, or sleep disturbances. In the last few days, the patient has been showing signs of anxiety and agitation, and we have given him anti anxiety and sedative drugs, but because of the change in his condition, his blood pressure has dropped, so the dose has been reduced, which is what happens in Surprise.

Day  10
We've got incoming on the vacated four beds, Young Woman in her 30s, critical.

Day  10

We've got incoming on the vacated four beds, Young Woman in her 30s, critical.

February 3rd, the 10th day of aid to Hubei. Today is the day shift.

At the end of the shift in the morning, Professor Zhou Xin suddenly asked us a question: "Do you know the procedure of transferring patients? " We looked at each other.

In retrospect, it seems that so far, we haven't had patients transferred out of our ward, only others have been moving them into critical care. Professor Zhou gave us a detailed account of the process of transporting patients, and then said, "soon you will need to use it. " This simple sentence contains too much positive information, let everybody already very exhausted body and mind suddenly invigorate.

Because there are ECMO patients in the ward, we all put forward, let Professor Chen Dechang give you training ECMO knowledge. After all, there were plenty of other doctors in the respiratory department besides the ICU, and we all had the same thirst for knowledge. According to the head nurse, their nursing team has begun to teach ECMO care, otherwise the ECMO specialist nurses are too hard. I suddenly remembered that Wu Wensan, a nurse in intensive care unit (ICU) of Yan Chai Hospital, was a specialist in ECMO. The intensity of his work really hurt us. Although those who can do more work, but also pay attention to the body AH!

For the treatment of patients with ECMO, single-use screen can not meet the protection requirements. So before entering the ward, we are required to wear goggles, and then wear a layer of disposable face screen. To reduce the fog, we wet our goggles with iodophor before wearing them, so our goggles are yellow. It took half an hour to complete the process. The pungent smell of Betadine, two layers of airtight protective clothing, two layers of medical surgical masks over the N95 mask, and the relative blurred vision make it difficult for us to work in full gear.

Into the isolation ward, found just before the empty four beds have been transferred patients. It was a young woman in her 30s who was breathing fast, her heart rate was racing, and she was in critical condition. After discussion, director Chen decided to give her tracheal intubation, by me to do professor Chen's assistant. I was in a state of agitation, in a sultry suit, and I was busy getting ready to intubate, and soon I was all sweaty.

A complete set of operations to do, and so take off protective clothing, put on a new mask and hat, it is 1:00 p.m. Every one of us was wet from hair to clothes, clinging to his body. At this moment, I really admire those nurses who work in isolation ward for a long time, really hard! I asked my former colleague at Ecmo what it was like, and his answer was "heatstroke. ".

There is certainly no time to eat, a lot of overdraw after the physical strength of no appetite to eat. It was four o'clock in the afternoon before I recovered from the fatigue of a hard day's work and was able to eat my lunch.

Just then, the good news came from the group: The patient in bed 29 was being transferred to the ICU. After these days of aggressive treatment, his condition has improved significantly, maintaining oxygen saturation at 95% without oxygen, and a 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test was negative, and hormone and antibiotic therapy was discontinued. One more negative nucleic acid test, and he'll be out and about. No wonder he thanked us during my rounds and said he would write a thank you note to our medical team.

Day  11
Bed 5 patient, 65-year-old she is killed by abominable pneumonia!

Day  11

Bed 5 patient, 65-year-old she is killed by abominable pneumonia!

February 4, the Eleventh Day of aid to Hubei.

Middle Shift today. Six hours without food, water, or toilet. Although they can withstand physical and mental fatigue, empathy for patients and their families is always frustrating. We had a middle aged man in bed 6, and when the patient's family called, I told her that the patient was not well and had multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

The patient's sister was on the phone, and her mother was being treated at the hospital. She wanted us to try to save bed 6, and I gently told her to be prepared.

Our five beds were gone, fast, and my heart broke when I heard the sobs of the family on the other end of the phone.

A 60-year-old woman with a post-op infection from rectal cancer didn't die of cancer, but was killed by this nasty new coronary pneumonia.

The woman on the other end of the line was crying and asking why? Why? But he was quarantined in another hospital, unable to see her one last time, and their daughter and son-in-law could not come to Hangzhou, so they had to entrust a relative to help with the related matters.

How many families have experienced this kind of pain in this new outbreak of pneumonia!

Today is the beginning of Spring, I think: No winter can not pass, no spring can not arrive! Will summer be far behind when spring comes? I am looking forward to seeing the Cherry Blossoms of Wuhan University, the busy traffic on the streets of Wuhan, and the beautiful view of the Yangtze River from Yellow Crane Tower

Day  12
Could not help shedding tears, not for their own hard work, only for the pain experienced by the people of Wuhan.

Day  12

Could not help shedding tears, not for their own hard work, only for the pain experienced by the people of Wuhan.

February 5, the 12th day of aid to Hubei.

I'm working the night shift from 6:00 to 8:00 tomorrow morning, which is 14 hours, so I need to rest up at the hotel and get my strength back.

After lunch, I'd like to go outside and bask in the Sun. Spring really arrived, I saw the roadside yellow grass has emerged in the Silk Green, early Sakura in the tree half is a flower, half already in full bloom. Pink Flowers, green grass... Spring in the branches has been ten, I suddenly filled with joy.

After lunch, I chatted with Dr. Yu, who was a colleague of Yan Chai Hospital in Wuhan, and learned that they were also very, very hard. He worked the day shift yesterday, from morning till half past ten, and in the middle he had only time for breakfast. The strong work pressure and the mental pressure, let him appetite become very bad. After more than 10 hours, his face has been pressed by N95 mask deep indentation, and even has a pressure sore on the bridge of his nose.

Today he is also the night shift, but today he rushed to the hospital during the day, to finish what he did not finish yesterday. He said that when a reporter interviewed him this morning, he couldn't help but shed tears, not for his own hard work, but only for the pain the people of Wuhan experienced.

Today, he works 12-hour nights, I work 14-hour nights, and we cheer each other on and wish each other good luck. Help each other, we work together in Wuhan Night!

Day  14
Yesterday's intubation was done by new Director Zhou, who is in his 60s.

Day  14

Yesterday's intubation was done by new Director Zhou, who is in his 60s.

February 7, the 14th day of aid to Hubei, Wuhan Cloudy Day.

From last night to today, the circle of friends was saddened by the death of Dr. Lee and felt aggrieved by the whole process of the incident. Dr. Lee is a hero, but I guess he does not want to be a hero, just a happy ordinary people.

The dead are not afraid to take responsibility. We are also ordinary people, and we have to do is remember this "ordinary" hero, shoulder our mission and responsibility as a doctor, continue to forge ahead.

Last night, I learned from the Jiao Tong University School of Medicine that the father of a clinical medical student was infected with COVID-19 pneumonia. The girl, Xiao Q, from Wuhan, returned home during the winter vacation and her father contracted new coronary pneumonia (a mild case, fortunately, and was admitted yesterday to the Shelter Hospital of the Wuhan Convention and Exhibition Center in Hankou) . More than 10 days ago, Q  himself began to have a fever, chest CT examination is no problem, now q has fever, in addition to a little sleepy, no other symptoms.

I took the initiative to contact the small Q, Comfort her, give her encouragement, but also in the professional guidance her. Although I can do very limited things, but I told her, she has the entire Shanghai Jiaotong University medical school teachers and students behind her, "We are always watching and supporting you. We hope you will be strong. And we hope you and your father will get well soon. " I am sure she will grow up to be a good doctor after this new crown disease.

At breakfast, I ran into Liu, the night shift leader of our group. He told me that new director Zhou did the TRACHEAL intubation yesterday. Director Zhou has more than 60 years old, is a respected professor, since the outbreak has been in the first line, his doctors benevolence let me admire.

Day  16
11 additional beds per floor to prepare for new patients. I've only had breakfast once in a dozen hours, and I feel like a camel.

Day  16

11 additional beds per floor to prepare for new patients. I've only had breakfast once in a dozen hours, and I feel like a camel.

February 9, the 16th day of aid to Hubei.

Today is the day shift, the first 10-hour day shift after the shift shift change.

Team leader Zheng Junhua through multiple contacts, and finally transferred from Shanghai Lung Hospital some nasal masks, two days later to the gold and Silver Tan hospital. When a non-invasive machine patient is feeding, he has to take off his mask and use a nasal Cannula, but for our critical patients, oxygen deprivation means that the disease can affect other organ functions, therefore, we suggest that it is best to change the patient to use a nasal mask when eating, so as not to affect the patient to eat, and will not cause the patient to be hypoxic for too long. Now the whole team wants to do is to improve the survival rate of critically ill patients, to think of patients, from all possible starting to solve the problem.

At noon, Zhou delivered the latest mission of the hospital: 11 extra beds per floor, ready to receive new patients. In the afternoon, the nurses are busy, bed, quilt, Oxygen Tank, oxygen meter head... . Everything has to be ready. Figured I'd have to take in patients tonight, and our night doctor's GonNa be busy.

It was dark outside when I got off work. When I got back to the hotel, I ate quickly. Dinner was only at 6:30 pm. I've only had one breakfast in a dozen hours. I feel like a camel, taking in lots of water and food when it's full, storing it in my body and using it when I need it.

More than 300 medical teams from Mount Hua and Ruijin hospitals will arrive in Wuhan today to take over the city's intensive care unit. The Circle of friends is filled with admiration and heartache for the medical staff. Yan Chai Hospital also issued an emergency call to prepare for possible follow-up departure. Many colleagues as ready to assist Wuhan's new blood, Wechat have asked me this old team member. I'll send you a list of all the supplies you'll need, including protective and household items, along with a few questions and caveats.

Day  17
Some patients said on the spot, his condition only need to be admitted to the Shelter Hospital, he does not want to live in our ward.

Day  17

Some patients said on the spot, his condition only need to be admitted to the Shelter Hospital, he does not want to live in our ward.

On February 10, the day after arriving in Wuhan, it was cloudy and rainy. Seventeen.

The nurses of the Shanghai Medical Team in the isolation ward of Jinyintan Hospital have changed their shifts from 6-8 hours to 4 hours. This is the head nurse from the transfer of light ward and Shanghai after the reinforcement of nurses have changed.

The four hours in the isolation ward were a physical ordeal, smothered in breathless gowns and protective clothing, and they always came out wet, with wet hair and deep masks carved into their faces. Four hours, they all had to leave an hour early, and it would take at least half an hour to get to the hospital, change and put on a protective suit. At 3:00 in the morning in the dead of night, they always travel together.

The new beds, which were added yesterday afternoon, are still taking in patients at night. Because of the limitations, only patients with severe new coronary pneumonia, that is, patients who only need oxygen and medication (in our eyes, they can only be regarded as light patients) . But even so, it adds a bit of pressure to the job. Newly admitted patients can only use cylinder oxygen, because the task suddenly, the Oxygen Cylinder Watch head is limited, the hospital has no time to transfer so many oxygen watch heads, so only one watch head can be connected with the double-way pipe, giving two patients oxygen at the same time, as a result, one cylinder does not have enough oxygen for one day, requiring the nurse to change it over and over again, which adds to the workload outside of nursing.

For critically ill patients, watching so many critically ill patients in bed, breathing through the breathing, there must be some psychological pressure. There was even a patient who said on the spot that he only needed to be admitted to a shelter hospital and that he didn't want to be in our ward. Well, the oxygen must be good for his condition.

These patients sit in the hallways of our isolation ward, breathing in oxygen, swiping their cell phones and watching our staff as they move, and it feels like a greater supervision of our work! Maybe, when the patient gets better and gets out of the hospital, he can write a book called "my days in isolation" ? !

Day  18
We never gave up on anyone, not even for a chance. But the patients in beds 18 and 19 died.

Day  18

We never gave up on anyone, not even for a chance. But the patients in beds 18 and 19 died.

February 11, the 18th day of aid to Hubei.

Early in the morning, I got some bad news from the group: Our 18 bed and 19 bed patients had passed away. This let me finally pacify the mood, all of a sudden fell into depression.

Bed 18 is an 89-year-old man with underlying diseases. He has contacted his family several times to inform them that the prognosis is not good. But as medical staff, we do not give up, even if there is only a glimmer of life, we are also doing our best, with high-flow oxygen, non-invasive suction machines and other treatment measures, he died of respiratory failure and kidney failure, though.

The one step between life and death once again made me regret (a hard day) , even though we never gave up trying to save anyone.

It's the night shift. I need to get some sleep during the day to get my strength back. I wake up after nothing to do, do not want to read, do not want to brush Wechat, do not want to let their mood again ups and downs.

6:00 sharp. I'm one of three women on the night shift. In our ICU, only four of the more than 20 doctors are women. Today is the first day that three women are on duty at the same time, and we're under a lot of pressure. Two were from the suction department, and the other was a Chinese doctor. Dr. Zhuge Liang is the most nervous, I am the most calm, The Three Stooges, top of the Zhuge Liang. The three of US took a photo in front of the office as a memento, sending a friend circle -- Foshan -- THREE WOMEN ON DUTY! Let the people who care about US know they're okay.

I hope this night is special.

Day  19
"Shanghai Plan" to consider everything, feel after the night shift to fill up the spirit of food, sweep the night of fatigue.

Day  19

"Shanghai Plan" to consider everything, feel after the night shift to fill up the spirit of food, sweep the night of fatigue.

February 12, the 19th day of aid to Hubei.

Three women will be on duty or good luck, in addition to sporadic handling of two incidents outside, it is really a night without distinction.

Dr. Zhou, who is on duty with me, is from the Level II hospital. She said that today is her first night shift alone in the intensive care unit in Wuhan. Her heart beats faster than ever. She was nervous about how to deal with things that happened during the night, and the other two of US consoled her together, the three of us, working together, helping each other. The first half of the night was spent quickly getting acquainted with new patients and reviewing old ones. The second half of the night, finally can have a good rest, the night of biting cold in the protection of cotton coat, heater disappeared without a trace.

At 8 o'clock, Director Xiong Weining, from the division of smoking in Shanghai's Ninth Hospital, gave a lecture on the subject of viral pneumonia. Director Xiong has already summed up the experience of patients'diagnosis and treatment some time ago, combining the experience of other leading doctors in the front line of the Wuhan Intensive Care Unit with the experience of ICU specialists in various hospitals in Wuhan in treating critically ill patients in the previous month and the experience of treating SARS in 2003, a set of rescue models for the critically ill patients with new coronary pneumonia in Shanghai medical team has been worked out for us, from the parameters of non-invasive aspiration pneumonia setting, the reasonable time of tracheal intubation, the right time of hormone use, the dosage and course of treatment of hormone, what types of patients use nasal masks, how to go offline, and so on. His "Shanghai Plan" to consider everything, feel after the night shift to replenish the full spirit of food, a sweep night of fatigue.

At the end of the lecture, Zheng Team stressed that our patients should have standardized treatment. Based on standardization, precise treatment requires further adjustment of aspiration parameters, attention to complications of mechanical ventilation and systemic organ function. In addition, we must pay attention to humanistic care, emphasizing that doctors care for patients in addition to physical diseases, but also to pay attention to the psychological changes of patients.

Today, the group posted a patient's diary, detailing his experience and journey after entering the isolation ward, the patient wrote: As a Wuhan resident, this epidemic is terrible, but at the same time, felt that the five lakes and four seas are one family, one side is in trouble, all sides support the human true feelings.

Day  20
Professor Zhou Xin in the tracheoscope under the guidance of Nasal intubation, Liu Group leader did not sleep all night.

Day  20

Professor Zhou Xin in the tracheoscope under the guidance of Nasal intubation, Liu Group leader did not sleep all night.

February 13, the 20th day of aid to Hubei.

The two beds that were vacated yesterday were soon filled with new patients. One of the patients was admitted and had to be intubated because of his critical condition. Zhou was intubated by nose under the guidance of tracheoscope, but the patient developed severe acidosis and respiratory failure, which kept Liu, the night shift leader, awake all night, adjusting the parameters of the suction machine.

In order to save the patient's life, the medical staff will give him prone position ventilation today. The patient weighs about 200 catties, wearing layers of isolation clothes we feel powerless, the entire five medical staff spent nine strong effort, only carefully complete the patient's turn. Professor Zhou adjusted his breathing parameters again, hoping he would pull through.

Recalling that at this morning's meeting, Professor Chen said that the inflammatory storm caused by viral infection is different from the inflammatory storm caused by bacterial endotoxin, and that if fever occurs again during the course of the illness in critically ill patients with new pneumonia, which could indicate a poor prognosis for this patient. And yesterday, the patient's temperature was over 39 degrees Celsius, so it's unclear if he's GonNa make it, but none of us are willing to give up.

There's a new machine in the isolation ward: the Oxygen Machine. This is a donation from the care enterprise to our medical team. The team leaders, taking into account the need for extra beds in the wards, the need for oxygen inhalation for the critically ill patients, and the possibility of safety problems arising from the repeated replacement of oxygen cylinders, added four oxygen generators to each floor urgently, so as to be safe for the patients, and easier to care for.

Day  21
Ecstatic. The first patient in our ICU has been discharged!

Day  21

Ecstatic. The first patient in our ICU has been discharged!

February 14, Day twenty-one.

The office atmosphere is a bit depressing, the original intubation of the patient or died, Professor Chen's virus inflammation storm theory was again verified. The three doctors on duty in the ICU had a busy night last night and were unable to get back to work. Everything I could think of, everything I needed to do: tracheal intubation, invasive ventilation, prone position ventilation, lung recruitment... And yet, the virus is still so aggressive in taking patients away.

At the end of the shift... We have observed on the death of cases were analyzed and summarized: No Secretions of the Airway, unable to re-open the Alveoli, blood coagulation dysfunction, myocardial Zymogram increased, difficult to control blood pressure, fluid control...

Because from all the major hospitals in Shanghai, we all have their own team behind the plan, Zheng Junhua captain asked you for the treatment of whether there is a new idea. After everyone expressed their opinions, Zheng Team concluded the Treatment Direction: The first way is to be stable and strictly follow the guidelines, but it seems difficult to reduce the death rate of critically ill patients; the second way is to make steady progress, we can add potentially useful drugs to the guidelines; the Third Way is to take a risk and use some drugs if they save lives, but only if they have to go through a medical ethics review.

Good news today. The first patient in our ICU was discharged today. All of our patients have been transferred to the light ward since they got better. They were not discharged from our ward at the time of statistics. For the first time in more than 20 days, we feel the joy of patients discharged from hospital: When the patient raised his thumb, we feel ecstatic that all the pay is worth it.

We have a couple in ICU, beds 15 and 6, who are both in isolation with a new case of coronary pneumonia. The wife in bed 15 is heavier and requires noninvasive ventilation; the husband in bed 6 is lighter and receives oxygen. The timid 15 bed all needs the person to accompany, the night is the nurse to accompany, even goes to the toilet also is to call the nurse to stand outside, the day is 6 bed patient many times past to accompany.

Today is Valentine's Day, two people sit together, although no flowers, but one hand holding an apple, piously asked our nurses to take a group photo.

Day  23
First and second in the country! Thank you to the patients in beds 5 and 24 and their families for their decision.

Day  23

First and second in the country! Thank you to the patients in beds 5 and 24 and their families for their decision.

February 16, day twenty-three.

Yesterday, when I switched off with the night shift, I told the shift doctor that the other patients in our group were all stable, but bed 5 was not in good condition, and the examination indexes in the afternoon were not very optimistic, you'd better ask the new Professor Zhou if you can adjust your medication when you make rounds tomorrow. As soon as I got dressed and went downstairs, I heard about the cardiac arrest in bed five. How is that possible? Before oxygen saturation and heart rate are good, I how also can not believe!

Shortly after 8:00 p.m. last night, a message was sent from our doctors'group: The family of bed 5 has agreed to an autopsy, and has signed it. What's going on? Is it true bed five is dead? Call the doctor on call. It's another cardiac arrest.

Bed 5 is an old gentleman, remember he has been more irritable, yesterday began to drowsiness, the family is ordinary people, there is nothing special.

At present, for the physiological and pathological changes caused by the new coronavirus, we are more based on clinical symptoms to infer, but there is no pathological basis. If the 5-bed family does agree to an autopsy, which would be the first in the country, the decision would be a major step forward in our understanding of NCP.

The decision was sudden, and the group was awestruck.

In the eyes of the Chinese who believe in being buried, the family members of bed 5 made a touching decision. Perhaps his decision will help us to study the pathogenicity and lethality of NCP and provide evidence for saving more severe cases of NCP in the future. This afternoon, we learned that bed 24's family has also agreed to perform an autopsy.

I can't tell you how grateful I am. The people of Wuhan, and indeed the people of China, should be grateful for the decision of the patients in beds 5 and 24 and their families. They should be grateful for the suffering of the people in Wuhan, for their selflessness and dedication behind their grief.
