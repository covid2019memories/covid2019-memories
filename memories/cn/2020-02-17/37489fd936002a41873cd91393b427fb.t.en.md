Thanks to Sohu video for its support, Mr. Charles Zhang is also our co founder.

I also have a more special identity, before the public welfare, is a grass-roots officials in Hubei Province, served as county Party secretary of Badong County. I grew up in Hubei, study, join the Party, work. These days, my family and I have been at the heart of the epidemic, with mixed feelings. I would like to take this opportunity to share with you my experiences, feelings and thoughts.

What I've been through these last few days

On January 19(December twenty-five) , I took the high-speed train from Shenzhen to my home in Yichang, Hubei Province. Thinking of spending a peaceful Spring Festival holiday with my family, I returned to Shenzhen on the sixth day of the first lunar month. On the evening of the 20th, we saw the news that academician Zhong Nanshan had confirmed the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 pneumonia. On January 29th, the first confirmed case was found in the building where I live. It was just below me. Our whole building has been sealed off and quarantined ever since. I live in a small community, to date there have been six confirmed cases of infection and a number of suspected cases.

On January 24, New Year's Eve 30, I saw on the Internet the announcement that all major hospitals in Wuhan are in urgent need of protective materials. On the evening of January 24, my colleagues from the Shenzhen Foundation Development Promotion Association and I discussed online how to fight the epidemic of pneumonia. On the morning of January 25, the first day of the first lunar month, i, as the executive chairman, convened an online meeting of the chairman's office, launched a Joint Action Initiative to fight the pneumonia epidemic to the entire Shenzhen Foundation Industry, and mobilized the Shenzhen Foundation to participate in the rescue of the Hubei Epidemic, more than 30 foundations responded that day. On the first day of our junior year, we formed the Shenzhen Foundation Joint Action Team Working Group. Now, the number of our group has reached 184. Basically, all the active foundations in Shenzhen are involved.

Shenzhen Foundation staff have been on duty since the beginning of the Lunar New Year to support the work of Shenzhen foundations, help people sort out needs, connect resources, coordinate logistics and customs clearance, etc. , through information sharing and close cooperation, the foundation in Shenzhen has been able to contribute to the fight against the epidemic in the shortest possible time. As of February 14, more than 80 foundations in Shenzhen had donated 1.39 billion yuan in cash and various medical supplies, not including the 1.2 billion yuan additional special fund for fighting the epidemic from the tencent foundation.

The Shenzhen Henghui Children's Public Welfare Foundation, which I founded, is also taking active action. Since the outbreak, Henghui has raised a total of 11,233 masks, 1,538 pairs of goggles, 6,432 bottles of disinfectant, 101 vehicle mounted air purifier, and 938 isolation gowns, they have been sent to seven medical institutions, including Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan Third Hospital, Wuhan Children's Hospital, Xiangyang Health Commission, Yichang Central People's Hospital and Songzi People's Hospital. In addition to the donation of materials, Henghui partners have also actively participated in the anti-epidemic work of the Shenzhen Foundation Development Promotion Association, the Shenzhen Xingzhengde Foundation and the Wuhan University volunteer convoy.
How I feel

As if in a hurry

There were a few moments when it was really urgent and stressful.

Once, when the Wuhan Union Hospital gave a television interview to provincial leaders saying that on the night when supplies were plentiful, they released to the public, protective materials are not in a hurry, but they are gone. That night, I sent messages everywhere like crazy, hoping to scrape together some medical supplies to get to the front.

Once, a few days before the decision was made at the Shelter Hospital after February 3, there were a number of pneumonia patients on Weibo asking for help. Although I was isolated at home, I still knew many friends in Hubei, officials, doctors, journalists. I kept harassing these friends for several days, hoping to help them link resources, but they were also busy at the front. Watching the lights of life slowly go out, anxious, almost desperate, there were several sleepless nights.

As if she were inconsolable

I believe this is also how too many people in Hubei feel these days.

FRIEND CIRCLE DARE NOT SEE, have to see again, because I still have to do relevant public welfare work. In order to prevent infection, I dragged my daughter to the funeral home without saying goodbye after she died. After watching the video of her crying for her mother, I found it difficult to fall asleep all night. I didn't wait for the old man who jumped off the bridge to kill himself with the test reagent at the entrance of the Yangtze River Bridge, uREMIC patients with pneumonia who jumped to their deaths in an attempt to ease the burden on their families, those with suspected infections on the streets who did not know where to go, need to be quarantined... especially from February 4 to 5, i saw a family of three people infected with the help of information, the first two days of suspected pneumonia has gone an old man, another old man is also seriously infected and can not wait for nucleic acid testing and hospitalization, I tried to help them contact the hospital, finally 5 night old man into the hospital, the result of the feedback I received is "into the hospital directly into the emergency room, too late... " , see the message I burst into tears on the screen.

Teacher Fang Fang's words: The era of a grain of dust, fall on everyone's head is a mountain. These days will often involuntarily shed tears, the kind of heart-cone pain, Wuhan, Hubei people know in the heart.

The power to hold on

In addition to the pain of suffering, there are powerful forces that move us, that call us.

The tens of thousands of health care reversers who have marched to the front lines of the fight against the pandemic are the warriors of our time. 1,716 health care workers have been infected, six have been killed, the numbers are tragic, and the images are seen through tears.

On the evening of the Spring Festival, the military hospital set off on a large scale for Wuhan. The video of them jogging to board the plane made people's eyes misty and burnt. All the male doctors in the two hospitals in Xiangya had shaved their heads, the images of the female doctors, all with short hair and diapers, leaving for Wuhan were filled with tears. The candlelight on the night of the death of Dr. Li Wenliang was filled with a screen of mourning. Academician Zhong Nanshan's tears, which he could not resist, were shown on camera, there are ten million great acts of kindness by ordinary people, and so much power to carry us through this dark time.

As if she wasn't afraid

I spent the Spring Festival in my hometown in Hubei, around 100 meters around my side has been confirmed infected six people, I live in the community closed, buildings closed.

But I'm not scared at all.

One is that the virus, though severe, is only a biological virus in nature, and what's really scary is the virus in the brain, which is not listening to the underlying suffering, which I believe is destined to be exposed and cleaned up.

Two, I don't have time to be afraid. What really scares us is the fear itself. I just want to race against time and do something to fight the epidemic. I online command deep foundation partners active action, Online co-ordination Henghui partners to carry out public welfare action.

I also made a reading plan for myself, reading two hours a day, I insisted on cooking a meal for my family every day, I insisted on playing a set of Taijiquan in the living room every day. I'm sure the epidemic will pass, and everything will be fine. I'M NOT SCARED! Also hope that we do not fear, pay attention to psychological adjustment, do more meaningful things, can make good use of this time together, as the practice of life.

My thoughts

As if this outbreak were a test, the question was: for everyone who bears public responsibility, where do you stand in thinking?

What is the most important thing in an official's mind?

Official position, face, or the common people's sufferings?

Xi demanded "to keep in mind the fundamental tenet of serving the people heart and soul, to stick to the original intention with firm ideals and beliefs, and never to be separated from the masses, belittled the masses and ignored their sufferings. " Many people followed suit, what's going on inside your head? Heaven Thick soil, the masses can not be deceived, we are clear-eyed.

What is the most important thing in the heart of the Public Welfare Person?

Fame, size, or the needs of the afflicted?

It is the iron law of the commonweal that every contribution of the public can not be dishonoured. We public welfare people must not walk to forget the original intention. In this epidemic, the enthusiasm of the Society for donations is on the rise. Some charitable foundations that have received large donations must make good use of every penny of public donations, don't try to cash in on a huge public donation with the idea of "a big pot of porridge, " or treat it as if you could eat a lot of interest just by holding the money down for a while. If, by the time the epidemic is over, the foundation has yet to spend the huge amount of money it has raised from the public, you may want to save it for later.

Murphy's law thinking should become the common sense of public governance.

Murphy's law states that if there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways leads to disaster, then someone must make that choice.

My interpretation of Murphy's law is that if something is likely to go wrong, no matter how small, you have to think about what the worst case scenario is and be prepared for how to deal with it so that it might not happen. Otherwise, it must, must happen!

Especially when it comes to people's lives and health, you have to anticipate the worst and prepare for it. We look back to see how the two months of social disaster happened: The discovery of cases and the forewarning of eight doctors suggested that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, but there is no... the possibility of things getting worse is becoming more and more obvious, still holding on to the luck of the psychological inch by inch to yield defense, do not hear public opinion, do not understand the actual, do not grasp the point, ultimately leading to a catastrophic social disorder.

"To be born in sorrow and to die in contentment is the law of the vicissitudes of history. To uphold bottom-line thinking and make the best preparations is the magic weapon for the prosperity of our Party. We must consistently strengthen our sense of urgency and guard against risks and challenges. ". Now reread the words highlighted by General Secretary Xi on Jan. 8,2018, during the opening session of a seminar on the implementation of the spirit of the 19th Party Congress.

How should social forces such as the non-profit organizations participate in and promote social governance?

Social Forces such as public welfare organizations played an important role in the anti-epidemic war, but they also faced many problems.

In the war against the epidemic, the public welfare sector took the first active action, and the State Ministry of Civil Affairs issued the initiative and guidance in the first time. The actions of Numerous Public Welfare organizations are commendable, not only helping the Hubei epidemic area solve many practical problems, in addition, a lot of self-organization appeared in the civil society very quickly, such as self-organizing, self-organizing, self-organizing, self-organizing, self-organizing, self-organizing, self-organizing, self-organizing and self-organizing, such as the government bus shutdown after the city to send medical personnel to work volunteer service team, the official channel congestion after Weibo, Wechat, Douban and other platforms of rescue and mutual rescue information transmission. It can be said that public welfare organizations and other social forces in the war against the epidemic is to make a difference.

But the public sector faces a lot of stress and exposure in this campaign.

The first is that the space and channels for the participation of public interest organizations are still limited. As a public servant in an epidemic area, I have experienced moments of powerlessness and frustration these days.

At the beginning of the outbreak, we found that the domestic purchase of masks, goggles, protective clothing and other materials not only skyrocketed in price but also difficult to purchase, so we quickly contacted overseas public welfare donations, but at that time, Wuhan clearly replied that it would not accept overseas donations; Two days later agreed to accept overseas donations, customs clearance procedures and how to deal with all kinds of muddled; materials finally to Wuhan, the distribution of inefficiency and confusion and broke the heart; Finally, the donated materials passed through a certain place in another province and were forcibly detained and requisitioned. The phone calls and letters were exhausted, but they were still not settled. Finally, our public welfare organization was able to donate directly to the hospital, point to point, it was also warned of the possible risks of bypassing the Red Cross donations; Hubei, in addition to Wuhan, is able to transport donations for public welfare directly, and the local and municipal public welfare transportation channels are not free, so only the following hospitals can issue special passes and drag them to Wuhan by themselves, it's hard to fill a whole car with the supplies we collect from our little charity organization. It's hard to bear the thought of the hospitals below going through the layers of checkpoints to get the few supplies

Secondly, there are still some shortcomings in the professional level of public welfare organizations: Whether the project design conforms to the mission and business scope of the organization, whether the Organization can guarantee the project implementation, whether the use of funds and materials collected by the foundation is fully open, whether the needs of the organization are completely clear, whether the information obtained in time, whether the materials are transferred in place, etc. . Judging from the numerous reports and feedback from the public on the Internet, many of the questions are worth asking.

In addition, coordination between public welfare organizations is not enough, official public welfare organizations and non-governmental public welfare organizations did not timely and effective joint. For example, after the epidemic prevention and control just started, all the major public welfare organizations took active actions, but they basically fought their own battles, resulting in competition among their peers, mismatch between demand and supply, and even played a certain negative role in the increase in the price of medical supplies. "ideal and wisdom" social groups and "Shenzhen Foundation anti-epidemic Joint Action Group" wechat groups have played a lot of roles in this regard, however, there is a lack of information sharing and coordination communication on the whole.

And then there's the public interest groups, which are all focused on what's right in front of them. In fact, secondary disasters are taking place in the affected areas, not to mention the effects of a general economic and social moratorium, psychological problems caused by the prolonged isolation of the general public, the comfort of the families of the victims who have suffered emotional collapse, and the encouragement of medical personnel after severe trauma, the environmental consequences of excessive use of disinfectants, and even the isolation of unguarded pets, are worthy of public interest groups to do things that are currently of little concern.

All non-profit organizations are expected to operate transparently and under the supervision of the public.

Once again, the epidemic shows respect for the public's right to know, and letting the truth come out sooner rather than later is the best response. This is not only the basic principle of crisis management, but also the daily working principle of public welfare management. Public Welfare Organizations can be trusted by the public only if they operate transparently and accept the supervision of the public in peacetime. In wartime, they can pool resources rapidly and allocate resources efficiently. The public can not and should not be let down with every penny, and the public has the right and the duty to monitor the use of charitable organizations at all times. Public interest organizations have an absolute obligation to accept public supervision, and they must not think that standing on the moral high ground will entitle them to cross-examine the supervision, because the public supervision will not be patient.

In the final analysis, this is a war without guns, we are all rushed into battle. I wonder whether the public sector should have an emergency plan, just as the government has an emergency plan for public disasters, in the event of a major disaster, it will be able to integrate all kinds of foundations, such as education, environmental protection, medical care and social services, in an efficient and efficient manner. They will act in an active and orderly manner, come out with me. In particular, the public health crisis and other disasters are different, how effective public interest organizations cut into. Our country is full of disasters. We don't know when the next disaster will occur. I hope that next time, our community will be well prepared.

In the face of major disasters, countries usually start emergency response mechanisms with linkage mechanisms, central and local linkage, linkage between the various departments, between the civil-military linkage and so on. It is expected that the next time social forces such as public welfare organizations can enter the linkage mechanism of the whole country.

Hello, I am Chen Xingjia, a full-time public welfare person. I am the founder of the Shenzhen Henghui Children's Public Welfare Foundation, the Executive Chairman of the Shenzhen Foundation Development Promotion Association, and the CO founder of the Rural Development Foundation at the invitation of President Wang Shi. The Rural Development Foundation, led by Wang Shi, Feng Lun and Hai Wen, Unites Social Forces to support the country's rural revitalization strategy through public welfare. The foundation, in conjunction with the Institute and the Peking University HSBC Business School, launched the tomorrow horizon x creation workshop to disseminate scientific knowledge and innovative ideas. Because of the epidemic, the Rural Development Foundation has partnered with Sohu video to launch the first online lecture hall today. Thanks to Sohu video for its support, Mr. Charles Zhang is also our co founder.

I also have a more special identity, before the public welfare, is a grass-roots officials in Hubei Province, served as county Party secretary of Badong County. I grew up in Hubei, study, join the Party, work. These days, my family and I have been at the heart of the epidemic, with mixed feelings. I would like to take this opportunity to share with you my experiences, feelings and thoughts.

What I've been through these last few days

On January 19(December twenty-five) , I took the high-speed train from Shenzhen to my home in Yichang, Hubei Province. Thinking of spending a peaceful Spring Festival holiday with my family, I returned to Shenzhen on the sixth day of the first lunar month. On the evening of the 20th, we saw the news that academician Zhong Nanshan had confirmed the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 pneumonia. On January 29th, the first confirmed case was found in the building where I live. It was just below me. Our whole building has been sealed off and quarantined ever since. I live in a small community, to date there have been six confirmed cases of infection and a number of suspected cases.

On January 24, New Year's Eve 30, I saw on the Internet the announcement that all major hospitals in Wuhan are in urgent need of protective materials. On the evening of January 24, my colleagues from the Shenzhen Foundation Development Promotion Association and I discussed online how to fight the epidemic of pneumonia. On the morning of January 25, the first day of the first lunar month, i, as the executive chairman, convened an online meeting of the chairman's office, launched a Joint Action Initiative to fight the pneumonia epidemic to the entire Shenzhen Foundation Industry, and mobilized the Shenzhen Foundation to participate in the rescue of the Hubei Epidemic, more than 30 foundations responded that day. On the first day of our junior year, we formed the Shenzhen Foundation Joint Action Team Working Group. Now, the number of our group has reached 184. Basically, all the active foundations in Shenzhen are involved.

Shenzhen Foundation staff have been on duty since the beginning of the Lunar New Year to support the work of Shenzhen foundations, help people sort out needs, connect resources, coordinate logistics and customs clearance, etc. , through information sharing and close cooperation, the foundation in Shenzhen has been able to contribute to the fight against the epidemic in the shortest possible time. As of February 14, more than 80 foundations in Shenzhen had donated 1.39 billion yuan in cash and various medical supplies, not including the 1.2 billion yuan additional special fund for fighting the epidemic from the tencent foundation.

The Shenzhen Henghui Children's Public Welfare Foundation, which I founded, is also taking active action. Since the outbreak, Henghui has raised a total of 11,233 masks, 1,538 pairs of goggles, 6,432 bottles of disinfectant, 101 vehicle mounted air purifier, and 938 isolation gowns, they have been sent to seven medical institutions, including Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan Third Hospital, Wuhan Children's Hospital, Xiangyang Health Commission, Yichang Central People's Hospital and Songzi People's Hospital. In addition to the donation of materials, Henghui partners have also actively participated in the anti-epidemic work of the Shenzhen Foundation Development Promotion Association, the Shenzhen Xingzhengde Foundation and the Wuhan University volunteer convoy.

On February 15,2020, Chen Xingjia was invited to participate in the Joint Research Institute of the Rural Development Foundation and the HSBC Business School of Peking University to launch the "tomorrow horizon x workshop" to spread scientific knowledge and innovative ideas.

I grew up in Hubei, study, join the Party, work. These days, my family and I have been at the heart of the epidemic, with mixed feelings. I would like to take this opportunity to share with you my experiences, feelings and thoughts.

What I've been through these last few days

On January 19(December twenty-five) , I took the high-speed train from Shenzhen to my home in Yichang, Hubei Province. Thinking of spending a peaceful Spring Festival holiday with my family, I returned to Shenzhen on the sixth day of the first lunar month. On the evening of the 20th, we saw the news that academician Zhong Nanshan had confirmed the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 pneumonia. On January 29th, the first confirmed case was found in the building where I live. It was just below me. Our whole building has been sealed off and quarantined ever since. I live in a small community, to date there have been six confirmed cases of infection and a number of suspected cases.

On January 24, New Year's Eve 30, I saw on the Internet the announcement that all major hospitals in Wuhan are in urgent need of protective materials. On the evening of January 24, my colleagues from the Shenzhen Foundation Development Promotion Association and I discussed online how to fight the epidemic of pneumonia. On the morning of January 25, the first day of the first lunar month, i, as the executive chairman, convened an online meeting of the chairman's office, launched a Joint Action Initiative to fight the pneumonia epidemic to the entire Shenzhen Foundation Industry, and mobilized the Shenzhen Foundation to participate in the rescue of the Hubei Epidemic, more than 30 foundations responded that day. On the first day of our junior year, we formed the Shenzhen Foundation Joint Action Team Working Group. Now, the number of our group has reached 184. Basically, all the active foundations in Shenzhen are involved.

Shenzhen Foundation staff have been on duty since the beginning of the Lunar New Year to support the work of Shenzhen foundations, help people sort out needs, connect resources, coordinate logistics and customs clearance, etc. , through information sharing and close cooperation, the foundation in Shenzhen has been able to contribute to the fight against the epidemic in the shortest possible time. As of February 14, more than 80 foundations in Shenzhen had donated 1.39 billion yuan in cash and various medical supplies, not including the 1.2 billion yuan additional special fund for fighting the epidemic from the tencent foundation.

The Shenzhen Henghui Children's Public Welfare Foundation, which I founded, is also taking active action. Since the outbreak, Henghui has raised a total of 11,233 masks, 1,538 pairs of goggles, 6,432 bottles of disinfectant, 101 vehicle mounted air purifier, and 938 isolation gowns, they have been sent to seven medical institutions, including Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan Third Hospital, Wuhan Children's Hospital, Xiangyang Health Commission, Yichang Central People's Hospital and Songzi People's Hospital. In addition to the donation of materials, Henghui partners have also actively participated in the anti-epidemic work of the Shenzhen Foundation Development Promotion Association, the Shenzhen Xingzhengde Foundation and the Wuhan University volunteer convoy.

How I feel

As if in a hurry

There were a few moments when it was really urgent and stressful.

Once, when the Wuhan Union Hospital gave a television interview to provincial leaders saying that on the night when supplies were plentiful, they released to the public, protective materials are not in a hurry, but they are gone. That night, I sent messages everywhere like crazy, hoping to scrape together some medical supplies to get to the front.

Once, a few days before the decision was made at the Shelter Hospital after February 3, there were a number of pneumonia patients on Weibo asking for help. Although I was isolated at home, I still knew many friends in Hubei, officials, doctors, journalists. I kept harassing these friends for several days, hoping to help them link resources, but they were also busy at the front. Watching the lights of life slowly go out, anxious, almost desperate, there were several sleepless nights.

As if she were inconsolable

I believe this is also how too many people in Hubei feel these days.

FRIEND CIRCLE DARE NOT SEE, have to see again, because I still have to do relevant public welfare work. In order to prevent infection, I dragged my daughter to the funeral home without saying goodbye after she died. After watching the video of her crying for her mother, I found it difficult to fall asleep all night. I didn't wait for the old man who jumped off the bridge to kill himself with the test reagent at the entrance of the Yangtze River Bridge, uREMIC patients with pneumonia who jumped to their deaths in an attempt to ease the burden on their families, those with suspected infections on the streets who did not know where to go, need to be quarantined... especially from February 4 to 5, i saw a family of three people infected with the help of information, the first two days of suspected pneumonia has gone an old man, another old man is also seriously infected and can not wait for nucleic acid testing and hospitalization, I tried to help them contact the hospital, finally 5 night old man into the hospital, the result of the feedback I received is "into the hospital directly into the emergency room, too late... " , see the message I burst into tears on the screen.

Teacher Fang Fang's words: The era of a grain of dust, fall on everyone's head is a mountain. These days will often involuntarily shed tears, the kind of heart-cone pain, Wuhan, Hubei people know in the heart.

The power to hold on

In addition to the pain of suffering, there are powerful forces that move us, that call us.

The tens of thousands of health care reversers who have marched to the front lines of the fight against the pandemic are the warriors of our time. 1,716 health care workers have been infected, six have been killed, the numbers are tragic, and the images are seen through tears.

On the evening of the Spring Festival, the military hospital set off on a large scale for Wuhan. The video of them jogging to board the plane made people's eyes misty and burnt. All the male doctors in the two hospitals in Xiangya had shaved their heads, the images of the female doctors, all with short hair and diapers, leaving for Wuhan were filled with tears. The candlelight on the night of the death of Dr. Li Wenliang was filled with a screen of mourning. Academician Zhong Nanshan's tears, which he could not resist, were shown on camera, there are ten million great acts of kindness by ordinary people, and so much power to carry us through this dark time.

As if she wasn't afraid

I spent the Spring Festival in my hometown in Hubei, around 100 meters around my side has been confirmed infected six people, I live in the community closed, buildings closed.

But I'm not scared at all.

One is that the virus, though severe, is only a biological virus in nature, and what's really scary is the virus in the brain, which is not listening to the underlying suffering, which I believe is destined to be exposed and cleaned up.

Two, I don't have time to be afraid. What really scares us is the fear itself. I just want to race against time and do something to fight the epidemic. I online command deep foundation partners active action, Online co-ordination Henghui partners to carry out public welfare action.

I also made a reading plan for myself, reading two hours a day, I insisted on cooking a meal for my family every day, I insisted on playing a set of Taijiquan in the living room every day. I'm sure the epidemic will pass, and everything will be fine. I'M NOT SCARED! Also hope that we do not fear, pay attention to psychological adjustment, do more meaningful things, can make good use of this time together, as the practice of life.

My thoughts

As if this outbreak were a test, the question was: for everyone who bears public responsibility, where do you stand in thinking?

What is the most important thing in an official's mind?

Official position, face, or the common people's sufferings?

Xi demanded "to keep in mind the fundamental tenet of serving the people heart and soul, to stick to the original intention with firm ideals and beliefs, and never to be separated from the masses, belittled the masses and ignored their sufferings. " Many people followed suit, what's going on inside your head? Heaven Thick soil, the masses can not be deceived, we are clear-eyed.

What is the most important thing in the heart of the Public Welfare Person?

Fame, size, or the needs of the afflicted?

It is the iron law of the commonweal that every contribution of the public can not be dishonoured. We public welfare people must not walk to forget the original intention. In this epidemic, the enthusiasm of the Society for donations is on the rise. Some charitable foundations that have received large donations must make good use of every penny of public donations, don't try to cash in on a huge public donation with the idea of "a big pot of porridge, " or treat it as if you could eat a lot of interest just by holding the money down for a while. If, by the time the epidemic is over, the foundation has yet to spend the huge amount of money it has raised from the public, you may want to save it for later.

Murphy's law thinking should become the common sense of public governance.

Murphy's law states that if there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways leads to disaster, then someone must make that choice.

My interpretation of Murphy's law is that if something is likely to go wrong, no matter how small, you have to think about what the worst case scenario is and be prepared for how to deal with it so that it might not happen. Otherwise, it must, must happen!

Especially when it comes to people's lives and health, you have to anticipate the worst and prepare for it. We look back to see how the two months of social disaster happened: The discovery of cases and the forewarning of eight doctors suggested that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, that it could be forestalled, but there is no... the possibility of things getting worse is becoming more and more obvious, still holding on to the luck of the psychological inch by inch to yield defense, do not hear public opinion, do not understand the actual, do not grasp the point, ultimately leading to a catastrophic social disorder.

"To be born in sorrow and to die in contentment is the law of the vicissitudes of history. To uphold bottom-line thinking and make the best preparations is the magic weapon for the prosperity of our Party. We must consistently strengthen our sense of urgency and guard against risks and challenges. ". Now reread the words highlighted by General Secretary Xi on Jan. 8,2018, during the opening session of a seminar on the implementation of the spirit of the 19th Party Congress.

How should social forces such as the non-profit organizations participate in and promote social governance?

Social Forces such as public welfare organizations played an important role in the anti-epidemic war, but they also faced many problems.

In the war against the epidemic, the public welfare sector took the first active action, and the State Ministry of Civil Affairs issued the initiative and guidance in the first time. The actions of Numerous Public Welfare organizations are commendable, not only helping the Hubei epidemic area solve many practical problems, in addition, a lot of self-organization appeared in the civil society very quickly, such as self-organizing, self-organizing, self-organizing, self-organizing, self-organizing, self-organizing, self-organizing, self-organizing and self-organizing, such as the government bus shutdown after the city to send medical personnel to work volunteer service team, the official channel congestion after Weibo, Wechat, Douban and other platforms of rescue and mutual rescue information transmission. It can be said that public welfare organizations and other social forces in the war against the epidemic is to make a difference.

But the public sector faces a lot of stress and exposure in this campaign.

The first is that the space and channels for the participation of public interest organizations are still limited. As a public servant in an epidemic area, I have experienced moments of powerlessness and frustration these days.

At the beginning of the outbreak, we found that the domestic purchase of masks, goggles, protective clothing and other materials not only skyrocketed in price but also difficult to purchase, so we quickly contacted overseas public welfare donations, but at that time, Wuhan clearly replied that it would not accept overseas donations; Two days later agreed to accept overseas donations, customs clearance procedures and how to deal with all kinds of muddled; materials finally to Wuhan, the distribution of inefficiency and confusion and broke the heart; Finally, the donated materials passed through a certain place in another province and were forcibly detained and requisitioned. The phone calls and letters were exhausted, but they were still not settled. Finally, our public welfare organization was able to donate directly to the hospital, point to point, it was also warned of the possible risks of bypassing the Red Cross donations; Hubei, in addition to Wuhan, is able to transport donations for public welfare directly, and the local and municipal public welfare transportation channels are not free, so only the following hospitals can issue special passes and drag them to Wuhan by themselves, it's hard to fill a whole car with the supplies we collect from our little charity organization. It's hard to bear the thought of the hospitals below going through the layers of checkpoints to get the few supplies

Secondly, there are still some shortcomings in the professional level of public welfare organizations: Whether the project design conforms to the mission and business scope of the organization, whether the Organization can guarantee the project implementation, whether the use of funds and materials collected by the foundation is fully open, whether the needs of the organization are completely clear, whether the information obtained in time, whether the materials are transferred in place, etc. . Judging from the numerous reports and feedback from the public on the Internet, many of the questions are worth asking.

In addition, coordination between public welfare organizations is not enough, official public welfare organizations and non-governmental public welfare organizations did not timely and effective joint. For example, after the epidemic prevention and control just started, all the major public welfare organizations took active actions, but they basically fought their own battles, resulting in competition among their peers, mismatch between demand and supply, and even played a certain negative role in the increase in the price of medical supplies. "ideal and wisdom" social groups and "Shenzhen Foundation anti-epidemic Joint Action Group" wechat groups have played a lot of roles in this regard, however, there is a lack of information sharing and coordination communication on the whole.

And then there's the public interest groups, which are all focused on what's right in front of them. In fact, secondary disasters are taking place in the affected areas, not to mention the effects of a general economic and social moratorium, psychological problems caused by the prolonged isolation of the general public, the comfort of the families of the victims who have suffered emotional collapse, and the encouragement of medical personnel after severe trauma, the environmental consequences of excessive use of disinfectants, and even the isolation of unguarded pets, are worthy of public interest groups to do things that are currently of little concern.

All non-profit organizations are expected to operate transparently and under the supervision of the public.

Once again, the epidemic shows respect for the public's right to know, and letting the truth come out sooner rather than later is the best response. This is not only the basic principle of crisis management, but also the daily working principle of public welfare management. Public Welfare Organizations can be trusted by the public only if they operate transparently and accept the supervision of the public in peacetime. In wartime, they can pool resources rapidly and allocate resources efficiently. The public can not and should not be let down with every penny, and the public has the right and the duty to monitor the use of charitable organizations at all times. Public interest organizations have an absolute obligation to accept public supervision, and they must not think that standing on the moral high ground will entitle them to cross-examine the supervision, because the public supervision will not be patient.

In the final analysis, this is a war without guns, we are all rushed into battle. I wonder whether the public sector should have an emergency plan, just as the government has an emergency plan for public disasters, in the event of a major disaster, it will be able to integrate all kinds of foundations, such as education, environmental protection, medical care and social services, in an efficient and efficient manner. They will act in an active and orderly manner, come out with me. In particular, the public health crisis and other disasters are different, how effective public interest organizations cut into. Our country is full of disasters. We don't know when the next disaster will occur. I hope that next time, our community will be well prepared.

In the face of major disasters, countries usually start emergency response mechanisms with linkage mechanisms, central and local linkage, linkage between the various departments, between the civil-military linkage and so on. It is expected that the next time social forces such as public welfare organizations can enter the linkage mechanism of the whole country.
