According to Xi'an's request, the company will officially resume work tomorrow, and the company has issued documents one after another to count the number of employees who will be on duty as scheduled, centralized management of residential area access documents (Xi'an part of the residential area has been closed, access to the need to provide sealed materials, more stringent posted notice "after work can not go into the residential area, and their own units to negotiate to find a place to live") .

I was in a special situation and wrote an information note this morning to the project leaders. The notice from Hubei Province will resume work after February 13, and many enterprises will give notice on February 14. At present, it seems to be hanging, and may be sealed until the end of the month, it will take years for cross-provincial transport to be restored. When they returned to Xi'an, the foreigners from Hubei requested to report the information voluntarily. They were isolated for 15 days, stayed in hotels at their own expense, ordered takeout for three meals, and released after being released from observation.

Ordinary workers can report to the community, go home to stay for half a month, Hubei is the focus of care, must be unified observation. After reading the notice, I was even more afraid to return to Xi'an. I stayed in a hotel room with a stranger for half a month. Even if I wasn't sick, they might all have problems in isolation. I didn't think that my Wuhan Identity Card would become a hot potato. Some colleagues who live in Xi'an still have Wuhan Hukou, i almost got pulled over for a drive-by, and then I called the neighborhood, and the family had a warrant.

The diary I posted the other day mentioned that I regret not taking my family with me to leave Wuhan before I closed the city. I went out of town to find a place to stay. I received comments from "I didn't expect you... " backstage, and it's not wrong to stand at the other party's point of view, potential carriers of the virus run to other provinces and cities, even if they immediately find a hotel isolation, the middle will inevitably contact a lot of people, the virus is highly infectious, a little attention will be hit. But what Wuhan has shown so far is a punishment for the nine million people who have stayed in the city and obeyed. In future crises like this, no one wants to be a fool and will only run faster than this.

As of February 7th, official figures showed that Wuhan accounted for one third of the country's confirmed cases and three quarters of the country's deaths. The death rate from confirmed cases was 4.1% , the case fatality rate in Hubei province was 2.8% , and the average death rate in other provinces was 0.19% , in other words, the case fatality rate for confirmed cases in Wuhan is 22 times the overall level outside of Hubei (source: intelligentacaixin.com) .

The reason for the dramatic difference in mortality rates between Wuhan and the rest of the world is simply that the health system is overwhelmed, not because it's not working, but because it's just stuck. Early patients are not timely diagnosis and treatment, dragging into serious illness, while causing other complications, become critical. In other areas, if suspected or confirmed, medical resources are guaranteed. After being sent to the hospital, they can get almost the best treatment and care. The result of staying in Wuhan, uh, is that the sky should not be called out and the earth should not be broken. Life and death depend on luck.

I am just glad that my family and friends are not suffering from pneumonia. The wheel of fortune has turned to "temporary peace" . I don't have to face the torture and pain of not being able to get a bed, not being able to do tests, and going back and forth between the hospital and home. If something does happen, i may be the person who tweets, posts on Wechat, frantically calls, fills out forms, and runs back and forth to the hospital pharmacy.

There are only two kinds of people who can get a bed, who can get treatment in time, and who can't get a bed, who can't do a test. So ask me again if I'm leaving with my family, and the answer is still yes. Now many people call trans-provincial transfer treatment, some patients to the neighboring provinces and cities for treatment, do not insist on the "overall situation" , "sacrifice. After all, the next time disaster strikes, there's no guarantee that you won't be the honest man asked to stay, focus on the big picture (although the latest news now to the pneumonia "Armageddon" moment, not to open the referral, closed the door "dragon fight" a) .

To answer the second question, I was advised not to look at my phone, not to follow the news, but to look at something positive. I don't think I can do this, if everyone is in the mood of a spectator, and they end up watching someone drown, even if they have the finger to retweet,@other people with access and ability, are better than choosing to close their eyes and not say anything.

Secondly, seeing these messages is a way of choosing to remember, remembering the joys and sorrows of every common person, "remembering" is a powerful act, an autonomous decision and choice, and a way of giving my heart solace, the weight of "see" and "remember" is extremely heavy, even in itself is our moral responsibility.

I can not, at least, do this knowing that my fellow man is suffering without Poker Face. Many people say that this is reason and restraint, that this is not reason, that this is indifference, stupidity and selfishness. Unlike being unable to stand it, unable to watch it, choosing not to watch it, turning off the Internet, I resent the indifference of not caring about me, and I resent the fact that I still feel superior and stupid. Including the widely circulated "if you... , you... " text these days, forced blame, emotional kidnapping.

Yesterday, two ordinary people made me cry. One was a girl named Xiaohang on Douban. Her mother died of pneumonia, and her father also died of infection. Now she is also infected. Her heart is as dead as ashes. She gave up treatment, smoking failure is a cruel way to die, Mom, you take dad, the sky can be free breathing, "Dad, you go to mom, and wait for me. ". On her Weibo Account, she said she received many phone calls and was constantly concerned, but 99 percent of them were useless, going from hopeful to desperate. In just over a dozen days, she said goodbye to her two closest relatives one after the other. What should we do with the rest of our lives? Nothing more than a human tragedy. Every word in her diary is a suffocating agony. There is not even a cry of collapse, no string of exclamation marks, and in the most austere record, it's about the deepest pain. I hope the girl doesn't give up on therapy and gets over it.

The other is a video of a woman in Hanyang District, wearing pajamas, sitting on a balcony day and night tapping on an iron bowl for help. Her mother was seriously ill and still could not be treated. She also showed signs of mild illness. In the video, she sits on a small stool and taps a bowl on the floor, "help us, help us, I don't want to disturb you like this, there's really no way, help us, " she shouted in the Wuhan Dialect. Since the diagnosis was made on January 27, she has tried everything but still can not find a bed for her mother, community hospitals kick each other around, and there's a lot of rumors, bullshit, and lies under her help-seeking Weibo Account.

As a native of Wuhan, I have always felt that the Wuhan dialect is rough and tough, with its own "spicy flavor" and "ruthless strength" . After I went to university, I seldom spoke the Wuhan dialect, because speaking is like quarrelling, and speaking is urgent, everyone's acting like a hothead. A "what are you doing" concern, Wuhan words out of turn into "you are doing Moss Ah" , unfamiliar sounds like a blunt inquiry, easy to cause misunderstanding. In that video, the friendly local accent turns into a mournful cry. There is no city atmosphere, no scolding smell. The Crisp tap of the bowl vibrates in my ears. How desperate is it that a familiar dialect turns into the most desperate cry for help, would choose to sit on the balcony, shouting at other isolated neighbors at home.

If I were her, I would not disregard the image of the community beating drums, crying for help, or even lying on the ground to cast, will, at this time there is no dignity, only to survive.

In a call for help from a pneumonia patient, I saw a woman, several people in her family had been hit, her son was only three years old, she sent CT photos, they were done at my parents'hospital, the name of the doctor who examined her was a colleague in my father's department, he gave me Doraemon toys when I was very young, a moment I feel the epidemic is only so close to me, close to let me shiver all over.

And then there are the people who are stuck in the surrounding cities, who are running out of medicine and can't get it, who call my parents every day for express delivery, the women who are about to give birth, the other patients who desperately need surgery / Dialysis / blood transfusions.., and not a single piece of good news.

I also don't want to indulge in excessive sadness and pain, physical health, but also to ensure emotional stability, mental health. The most effective way to do this is to find something to keep busy: Talk to an online psychologist, read a book or play a Susan Sontag (the disease metaphor is a good one, as the aforementioned "Armageddon" is worth thinking about) , volunteer, join a support group. I want to watch and I want to act.

Originally signed up to feed cats, to the cats left in Wuhan Shovel excrement to feed, now the community is more strict, outsiders are not allowed to enter, so I changed to feed the nearby stray cats, no one on the street, cats can not find food and water. I often carry ham sausages in my pocket, and when I see a cat, I feed them sausages and dried fish, and some cats, used to being wild and wary of people, take a few steps and run away at once into the bushes and keep an eye on me, so I peel the ham sausages off and put them near, and run away quickly.

Some cats are very clingy, I suspect is abandoned domestic cat, or the owner can not come back, hungry ran out at home, yesterday saw a white cat, pure white hair, lake water as bright blue eyes, see I immediately ran over, in the trouser leg back and forth. Look at his belly is hungry flat, quickly feed ham sausage and pure water, this cat must be domesticated, raised his tail when I specifically looked at the eye, done sterilization. He was too clingy and coquettish to leave me, and wanted to take him home. He took some photos and sent them to the local group for help. He hoped that some kind people who lived nearby would adopt the white cat and go around the next day, the cat was nowhere to be found.

There are also abandoned cats in our neighborhood, several of them are all orange cats, they look like relatives, but there is only one black and white cat, with a perfectly normal square face and round eyes like Turquoise, with a glossy coat and a cleaner ear canal than other cats, like to play with a cat stick (other stray cats see the stick to scare away) , he may be abandoned by the community, left here, do not know whether he was the owner of broken heart, very alert, not to let people near.

What do you want to do after the epidemic is over? The other day you asked me this question. The answer is still to eat a lot, go to the movies, go shopping and buy a ticket to go back to work. Today I asked myself the answer is: I just want to take off my mask and go out on the street without any protection, a Walk in the street would be nice. I do not know what story will cause tears today, I hope that such a story less and less, let me save all the tears, until the end of the day to cry.

There are also abandoned cats in our neighborhood, several of them are all orange cats, they look like relatives, but there is only one black and white cat, with a perfectly normal square face and round eyes like Turquoise, with a glossy coat and a cleaner ear canal than other cats, like to play with a cat stick (other stray cats see the stick to scare away) , he may be abandoned by the community, left here, do not know whether he was the owner of broken heart, very alert, not to let people near.

What do you want to do after the epidemic is over? The other day you asked me this question. The answer is still to eat a lot, go to the movies, go shopping and buy a ticket to go back to work. Today I asked myself the answer is: I just want to take off my mask and go out on the street without any protection, a Walk in the street would be nice. I do not know what story will cause tears today, I hope that such a story less and less, let me save all the tears, until the end of the day to cry.
