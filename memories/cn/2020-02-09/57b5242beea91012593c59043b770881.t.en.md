We are an ordinary family living in a small city in the south of Shanxi Province. My daughter came out to me in March 2016. I couldn't accept her at that time. I used my computer Qq at work to write countless abusive words to her, i met Hidetoshi Dekisugi, a native of Shanxi Province, on the Internet, and she recommended me to attend the June 2017 Suzhou friends and Relatives Association Rainbow Partner Growth Camp Training, after which I accepted my daughter completely.

On January 29,2020, the 5th day of the 1st Lunar Month, a day when In the Heat of the Sun, folklore and epidemics were forbidden to leave the house, my children and I came out to my husband.

This secret has been in my heart for four years, too much time has been suppressed by the pain. Early in the morning I had breakfast with my husband. He said he couldn't sleep all night because his daughter didn't have a boyfriend. He said he had got through his daughter's mental work and agreed to find a partner. I thought, "SNAP! " How? My daughter has been adamant about coming out to me, and she and her friends have been through a decade and are very close. I talked to my daughter as soon as I finished dinner, and she said that dad might have misunderstood her, and I said that instead of coming out, it would be better to do it on a different day, since nothing could be done during the epidemic, so that my daughter could spend more time with her dad. So we came out to her father in the living room.

I told him the truth about my children and how I struggled to understand it. My husband burst into tears. Unable to accept the truth, he threw me and my daughter out of the door and took his hand. My daughter and I had to give him time to cool off. It's freezing outside, and I'm worried that his blood sugar is still high, i sent him Wechat Communication: "I know you are very painful, I also understand your sad, heart-wrenching, heart-wrenching, immediate death of the heart have, I am from the process out. ". I just want to tell you two points, one is that life is nothing but life and death, the other is that the child is our own, she does not want to do this, do not blame us to give birth to her so content. I understand that you suffer, you look online, can only rely on their own point of relief, not to say more, come back early, it's too cold outside, eat and sleep on time, health is the most important! You're the man of the house! You're the man of the house!"I sent him my collection of coming out articles, he didn't answer until nightfall, when he returned with his tired body. He didn't eat anything at noon or at night. His hands were red, swollen and cracked from constantly wiping his tears. The first day passed in a blur.

The next morning the husband still hid out, do not want to see her daughter, I let her go to grandma home, to give her husband to talk about the space. I sent him a Wechat message: "I want to tell you that first of all, the child is innocent, and she doesn't want to be born like this, so don't blame her. Second, she is no different from any other child except that she doesn't want to get married. She is just as good as any other child. We should feel sorry for the pain that the child has borne alone for so many years. ". Glad she did not worry about this depression, still strong to live! Third, there are difficulties in the face of a family, do not often do not eat, that is, to punish themselves and torture family members, and can not solve the problem, not worth the loss. Four is to know that you need time to understand their group, to re-understand what children really need, there is a process. The child is not force you accept her immediately, but please you still want to eat on time to take medicine on time to rest on time, life don't disorderly. You don't want to see her, she went to grandma's home for lunch, you come back at noon to eat! Remember!"and sure enough he came back at lunchtime, first ask me, have you seen a doctor? I said the first time to take the child to the hospital to see, the doctor said is born, can not change. I've read enough articles to know that it's not a child's choice, it's in their genes, and it's not their fault, he said. I said the character of most of the children with you, if the blame is mainly you! He also said that I read an article a Shandong father accepts the child's story, a character explosive father unconditionally accepts his son, only said that as long as the son is happy! I watched my husband relent a lot, even telling me not to let my daughter hide out anymore, and I secretly rejoiced that half of it was coming out, and the only thing left was the communication between father and daughter.

I went out the next morning to give them space. When I came back home, the sun was shining. My husband made lunch and told me that my daughter thought she was happy now. Isn't that what we want? Why spoil her happiness? Although he is said with tears, I know he began to accept the daughter, the world's greatest love than the father love like mother love like water!

I know that in a few days my husband can not completely out, he every day as long as the child can not stop the tears flow, I know his heart in the blood. To sum up the process of my husband's acceptance, first, he himself actively inquired on the Internet, second, I came out of the closet, and he felt the same deeply, what I said he listened to, and third, the children had doubts around them and could communicate in time, a child's happy life is what makes a parent happy.
