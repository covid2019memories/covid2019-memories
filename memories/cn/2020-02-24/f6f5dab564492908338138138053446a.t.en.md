A disrupted resignation plan

Louise Lee had planned to ask his boss for his resignation years later.

She had worked for four years as an engineering cost engineer at a private company in Chongqing, calculating the cost of construction. Working with numbers is exhausting, sitting in front of a computer for a day, and all the nerves in your body hurt. She stayed up until 11:00 or 12:00 at night when she got off work, her mind was in a fog, and she would rather have taken a taxi to get back to the neighborhood, where she was locked out several times and had to wake up the sleeping security guard to open the door. This is not the life a 25-year-old girl wants. She's determined to make it to the end of the year.

After the Spring Festival, the epidemic became more and more serious. The company's work schedule was changed from Feb. 3 to Feb. 10, and the night before Feb. 10 it was announced that Louise Lee was working from home, disrupting his plans to resign, "It's not serious enough to send a wechat or an email, and you have to go to the company to go through the exit formalities. "

What she did not expect was that her immediate supervisor called her several days before the start of the year to urge her to plan the work. At first, Li Siqi also obediently perfunctory in the past, until another phone call, told her to take over a project.

She was very angry, Heart Murmur: clearly still on vacation, you give me sub-items, in case I do not do it? Simply a "I do not have time" throw over, the boss asked, "then what do you do at home? " She replied: "I do not do. " The boss hung up the phone. "I guess I was pissed off, " Louise Lee later recalled, "but I just wanted to leave and not take the project. "

When the epidemic hit, not everyone could be as free and easy as Li Siqi. According to a survey released by Zhaopin on February 2,64 percent of job-seekers have adjusted their job-hopping plans due to the outbreak, while 34 percent are on the fence.

Chen Yan is one of them. She just turned 22 this year and is a course consultant for a children's art organization in Guangzhou. The physical education industry has been hit hard by the outbreak. To protect its customers, her company mobilized on Wechat on Feb. 3. All teachers will give free tutoring classes to students during the outbreak, top performing campuses or employees get a bonus -- supposedly paid for by principals.

"Can you imagine how difficult it is to teach kindergarten children to draw through a screen? " Chen said. Returning to work online is at least twice as much work as normal classes, and there is no rest for the Lantern Festival. On average, each teacher has to tutor 30 students in a few days.

The official resumption of work this ten days, Chen Yan has no breathing space. One-on-one classes start at 10 a.m. , one hour at a time, and at the end of the day, you can tutor five or six students. 7:00 pm to 8:00 PM is a three-on-one Winter vacation class counseling, after 8:00 to hold two meetings, 10:00 or so can be over.

"sometimes I really don't want to work at all, just lying there, or even looking for someone else to fake my work for me. " When I was feeling sluggish, the director sent me a message in the morning, and she returned in the afternoon, and was reminded by the director that "if I can't do it well, I'll be eliminated. ".

Chen wanted to resign years later, but after the outbreak, the next few months are hard to find work, family advised her not to act rashly. The thought of resigning could not be suppressed, so she had to talk to her colleagues. Of the 17 people in her position, five were just as ready to quit as she was, but each time ended up discouraging the other.

"It's hard to find a job after a disaster if you talk less and do more in special times, " a colleague told Chen.

Value of work replays

The sudden outbreak has disrupted career plans for some young people, including Louise Lee and Chen Yan. Faced with possible layoffs, Lost Year End Bonuses, uncertain job prospects and the dangers of returning to work in the face of an epidemic, the factors that drive their career choices are back on the table: stability or high pay, health or money, the sense of meaning at work, the stage of life... For most people, struggle is the norm.

Louise Lee looked determined, and before that, he had wavered at least four times. "For four years, I resigned almost once a year, " Louise Lee added, "but I never made it. "

She's a four-year veteran, and the boss won't let her go. In 2018, she started leading the team, staying up until 4:00 in the morning for two months. During the day to ask the progress of the team members, convey the boss's orders, the hands of the project can not finish, several times in the office all night crying. She has offered to resign twice, the boss did not agree, first stop her hands of the project, and gave her a change of department.

"In fact, our company is very good, in Chongqing cost consulting industry is among the top, but I can not imagine myself doing this at 30, " said Louise Lee, who will turn 25 this year and wants to switch to his favorite painting and photography, worry about their own learning to achieve nothing, "their work is too busy, no time to learn, once quit, gave up the accumulation of these years, to learn other do not know how to start. "

It wasn't until last August, when she married her high school boyfriend of many years and was expecting a baby within two or three years, that she realized the clock was ticking and wrote two key words in her notebook about the life she wanted: freedom and Visual communication, resigns again.

"This time I was very determined. My boss talked me out of it for two hours and didn't change my mind. Finally, my boss gave me no choice but to be grateful and stay until the end of the year. "

Once again, Louise Lee confesses, there are other considerations besides human kindness: After getting used to being busy, she finds life without a job or an income terrifying. There is a typical "workaholic" in the colleagues, so busy that they have no time to chat with each other, except going to work or going home. Louise Lee couldn't help but compare herself. "everyone else is going up, " she says. "You quit your job like you're going down. "

The extended family vacation from the outbreak was the last thing she had to worry about. For more than a decade, Louise Lee had slept in and out of bed, doing what she liked, and sometimes watching Douban and Taobao was a day, unlike at work, when there was always something to be said no to, a freedom she hadn't felt in a long time.

"I don't feel happy at work except for money, " Louise Lee said, "But I can resign at this special time, first of all, I have financial security. I don't have a lot of savings, but I can last a year. I don't have a mortgage, I don't have a car, I don't have kids. I can just eat by myself. "

On the one hand, the double workload and potential danger after resuming work, and on the other hand, a life without work and income in the next few months, the doubangoose group came up with such a multiple choice question, the poll of 4,299 participants, starting on February 10th, do you want to go to work or quit, 92 percent of those polled said they wanted to go to work or take time off.

In the current outbreak, resignation is still in the minority. Photo / still from "never born"

Whether or not you have enough money saved seems to be the key to deciding whether to stay or go during an epidemic. In the group discussion on the same topic, "originally intended to resign after years, now what idea? " Under the answer "you have enough savings to live for a year and a half to resign, do not have money is poor" received 579 votes in favor.

For Chen, who was born in 1998, none of these factors were taken into account. Working from home, she felt, wasn't much of a risk for pneumonia, and though she complained, the workload doubled -- she was able to cope with the stress of her job, teaching, marketing, and even home visiting, the average person changes once a month, and she's been doing it for six months.

"What I can't accept is that the boss only likes brown-nosing people, and especially likes to snitch behind their backs, " Chen said, "I have had several close colleagues who have been let go by their bosses for various reasons, and the working environment has made me feel depressed. "

The market is predicting that the job market will not improve until May. Fortunately, she lives with her family in Guangzhou and has enough savings to last her six months without the pressure of renting an apartment or eating three meals.

"I'm more concerned about what my family thinks. They supported my resignation and even helped me figure out what to do, but years later it was hard to find a job. I was not self-disciplined and they worried that once I got used to the homelessness state, I wouldn't want to work,"Chen admitted, in the light but risky and hard but stable life, she chose the latter.

Reshuffled professional life

While the epidemic has put workers in a struggle, it has also reshuffled the fortunes of different industries. The catering, hotel, tourism and Physical Education Industries have suffered heavy losses in general, and some companies have begun to lay off workers. Along with the industry reshuffle is the fate of the people inside, the original years after the appointment of Phoebe unfortunately became cannon fodder.

At the end of last year, Phoebe, a new mother of eight months, made one of the most important decisions of her 34 years: to leave her accounting job with good benefits and become an English teacher.

For more than three decades before Chen, she had been drifting from major selection to graduate work, either arranged by her parents or following the situation. After graduation in the teacher's introduction to a smooth entry into a chemical enterprise to do finance, a do is ten years.

The company's welfare package was more than adequate in the third-tier city of Shandong where phoebe lived, but phoebe always had a desire to prove herself. "I always felt that this was not the life I had chosen, or even that it had been too easy. "

She grew up on English, want to be an English teacher, but never had the courage to give up everything. Late last year, six months after giving birth, she finally made up her mind to resign.

"people [ around me ] don't understand why I'm doing this in my 30s when they think I'm crazy, " she said. She asked close friends before quitting and, without exception, urged her not to. Suddenly there was a loss of financial resources, and her husband did not agree at first. phoebe felt aggrieved, "Why should my parents live here to take care of my children, and I still can't do a job I like and make more money to pay the mortgage than you? " The husband felt ashamed and said no more.

Her parents, who were counting on the safety of their children, also disagreed. "My mother told me that she would tell my fortune and that I would be promoted in two years. She told me to stay there and not go. " phoebe thought about giving up, but she gritted her teeth and insisted, "This is the only time in a person's life that I might have a chance to do something like this. In two or three years, I won't have the courage. "

After leaving her job, she had to interview more than 10 educational institutions before she was offered the job. Although the salary was half of her original job, she still punched in all kinds of software to learn English, hope for a new life.

Until HR's phone call to resign, she was still at home to prepare for the teacher certification. "The other side said that according to the development of the epidemic, it is estimated that there will be no students in the training institutions for three or four months. " After receiving the phone call, phoebe collapsed directly on the bed in the study, not knowing how to tell her family, "Now I'm really depressed, I'm useless, I doubt myself, and I even dream of going back to work every night. "

While phoebe's path to self-justification was thwarted by the epidemic, the nurse found a sense of worth in her job.

On the third day of the outbreak, "I've been wondering why I wanted to study medicine so badly since I started working, " she wrote on her personal microblog. Questioned, scolded, threatened, pushed, the beginning of medical school seems to be more and more ambiguous. I thought about giving up, I thought about changing careers, until this outbreak, and then it hit me: If I could, I would."

She comes from a family of doctors, her father runs a private clinic in a small town in Sichuan, and her mother works for the local health system. In her second grade essay, what do you want to be when you grow up? She wrote, I want to be a doctor.

"there is no special reason, study medicine is my obsession, I am more stubborn people, so adhere to down. " Then said.

When the university filled in the application form, because she read is the Liberal Arts, can not study the clinical, has applied for the nursing. After the internship, she smoothly into a neighboring city, a third-class hospital, began training rotation.

From cardiothoracic surgery to emergency department to Pediatrics, "endless meetings, endless errands, and tense doctor-patient relationship... I do not seem to find their own patients to save the original intention. "

The biggest shock was the night shift in the emergency department, where patients came one after another, and doctors were too busy rescuing dying grandfathers to care for 17, or 18 year old boys. At first the doctor also patiently explained that the boy's mother in a side anxious to roar, the doctor is also angry: "Don't you see that the heart stopped over there? Can Not wait? "

"everyone seems to live and die on their own, " he said. "We feel bad that one patient didn't make it, but there is another patient who has become numb to life and death. ".

In her first year, she considered changing her job to become a clinical trial coordinator in Chengdu, but the salary was too small to get a foothold in the big city. Her mother urged her to wait until after the program was over, and for two years.

Soon afterwards, pneumonia broke out in Wuhan. "after the news of the pneumonia in Wuhan in December came out, we thought it was quite normal. After a moment of tension, we were told it was not SARS. " After confirming signs of human transmission, then the hospital began to call for volunteer medical teams to go to the front.

"almost everyone in our department has signed up, 14 nurses, and the doctor who is retiring this summer, except for one very old teacher, who is also on the line because of her husband and daughter. " News coverage of the medical staff's deeds, click into the comments, are also praise, "most people can understand our hard work. ".

On New Year's Eve, she cried when she saw the news that the military doctor was on the front line, "medical staff know best how contagious the disease is, but they still sign up for the front line. It's a sense of mission, " she said. She saw nurses who had left their jobs regretting that they had resigned late, or You can fight on the front lines, and then I'm glad I'm still here.

Due to her lack of experience in ICU and smoking, she failed to get into the support team twice. She felt a bit lost, but soon consoled herself with a sentence, "'you go to the front, we defend our homes' , whether it is the front line or the rear, do things that have the same value, is to heal the sick. "

As of February 20, the state, the armed forces, provinces and municipalities have sent a total of 255 units of 32,572 medical personnel to support Wuhan. Photo / Sina Weibo, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University

Waiting for the outbreak to get better

Find the original intention, and then feel more responsible for their work, do chores also have a sense of meaning, "chores are also to save the service. ".

Under the epidemic, people feel self-imposed home quarantine, her pediatric patients greatly reduced. "Last night there were 19 patients, usually around 80-100 at this time. "

She found she was more patient with her patients'families, explaining the details of their medications and health knowledge to them, instead of the usual time she spent writing down her temperature and dispensing.

"When you learn to think about them, the family members aren't so hard to get along with, " she said, adding that she still planned to take the exam, but more to improve herself than to escape. "I'm sure nurses are something I want to do. "

Phoebe, who was laid off, also made sure that teaching English was still her dream job, but things could have worked out better.

"I should have listened to my family and friends and gotten my year-end bonus. If that had been the case, I wouldn't be out of work right now, " said Phoebe, who resigned years ago to allow time for new hires, but did not expect, one day still keep her leadership, the next morning let her go immediately.

"I really regret that I had a dream the other day that my company wanted me to work for them, " said Phoebe, who was unable to settle down for her teaching certificate for a week or so. Every day in various social media platforms: micro-blog "super talk pneumonia" , Zhihu "how to find a job after the epidemic" , as well as various wechat groups in the information. "is to avoid active thinking and passive receiving as much as possible. "

In order to calm her anxiety, she contacted the training institutions she had learned about immediately after receiving the phone call of her resignation. This time, she lowered her requirement to "English for young children. " Three of them said that there was no shortage of students. After the notice from the Education Bureau to resume teaching came down, she'll be called for an interview.

She still do not trust, and to the recruitment website to browse the information of the accounting position, do second-hand preparation. In addition, she plans to take the government-issued Public Institution exam at the end of March, with the goal of getting a satisfactory offer in early April.

Biffi, who is more than a decade younger, is less sanguine. "I don't think I'm going to make it to March. " Juggling parents and superiors every day drove her crazy and kept her indoors, and she insisted on afternoon deliveries of starbucks or milk tea to ease her headache. The company was expected to function normally after the outbreak, but a few days ago, the director informed that only online courses outstanding performance can smoothly back to work, minimum wage, which means that others may even lose their jobs.

The thought of escape still lingered in her mind, but to appease her family, she had to compromise. "I kept trying to convince myself that I would be okay after today, that I would just get through the day, and that I would just get through it until the epidemic was over. "

From cardiothoracic surgery to emergency department to Pediatrics, "endless meetings, endless errands, and tense doctor-patient relationship... I do not seem to find their own patients to save the original intention. "

The biggest shock was the night shift in the emergency department, where patients came one after another, and doctors were too busy rescuing dying grandfathers to care for 17, or 18 year old boys. At first the doctor also patiently explained that the boy's mother in a side anxious to roar, the doctor is also angry: "Don't you see that the heart stopped over there? Can Not wait? "

"everyone seems to live and die on their own, " he said. "We feel bad that one patient didn't make it, but there is another patient who has become numb to life and death. ".

In her first year, she considered changing her job to become a clinical trial coordinator in Chengdu, but the salary was too small to get a foothold in the big city. Her mother urged her to wait until after the program was over, and for two years.

Soon afterwards, pneumonia broke out in Wuhan. "after the news of the pneumonia in Wuhan in December came out, we thought it was quite normal. After a moment of tension, we were told it was not SARS. " After confirming signs of human transmission, then the hospital began to call for volunteer medical teams to go to the front.

"almost everyone in our department has signed up, 14 nurses, and the doctor who is retiring this summer, except for one very old teacher, who is also on the line because of her husband and daughter. " News coverage of the medical staff's deeds, click into the comments, are also praise, "most people can understand our hard work. ".

On New Year's Eve, she cried when she saw the news that the military doctor was on the front line, "medical staff know best how contagious the disease is, but they still sign up for the front line. It's a sense of mission, " she said. She saw nurses who had left their jobs regretting that they had resigned late, or You can fight on the front lines, and then I'm glad I'm still here.

Due to her lack of experience in ICU and smoking, she failed to get into the support team twice. She felt a bit lost, but soon consoled herself with a sentence, "'you go to the front, we defend our homes' , whether it is the front line or the rear, do things that have the same value, is to heal the sick. "

As of February 20, the state, the armed forces, provinces and municipalities have sent a total of 255 units of 32,572 medical personnel to support Wuhan. Photo / Sina Weibo, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University

Waiting for the outbreak to get better

Find the original intention, and then feel more responsible for their work, do chores also have a sense of meaning, "chores are also to save the service. ".

Under the epidemic, people feel self-imposed home quarantine, her pediatric patients greatly reduced. "Last night there were 19 patients, usually around 80-100 at this time. "

She found she was more patient with her patients'families, explaining the details of their medications and health knowledge to them, instead of the usual time she spent writing down her temperature and dispensing.

"When you learn to think about them, the family members aren't so hard to get along with, " she said, adding that she still planned to take the exam, but more to improve herself than to escape. "I'm sure nurses are something I want to do. "

Phoebe, who was laid off, also made sure that teaching English was still her dream job, but things could have worked out better.

"I should have listened to my family and friends and gotten my year-end bonus. If that had been the case, I wouldn't be out of work right now, " said Phoebe, who resigned years ago to allow time for new hires, but did not expect, one day still keep her leadership, the next morning let her go immediately.

"I really regret that I had a dream the other day that my company wanted me to work for them, " said Phoebe, who was unable to settle down for her teaching certificate for a week or so. Every day in various social media platforms: micro-blog "super talk pneumonia" , Zhihu "how to find a job after the epidemic" , as well as various wechat groups in the information. "is to avoid active thinking and passive receiving as much as possible. "

In order to calm her anxiety, she contacted the training institutions she had learned about immediately after receiving the phone call of her resignation. This time, she lowered her requirement to "English for young children. " Three of them said that there was no shortage of students. After the notice from the Education Bureau to resume teaching came down, she'll be called for an interview.

She still do not trust, and to the recruitment website to browse the information of the accounting position, do second-hand preparation. In addition, she plans to take the government-issued Public Institution exam at the end of March, with the goal of getting a satisfactory offer in early April.

Biffi, who is more than a decade younger, is less sanguine. "I don't think I'm going to make it to March. " Juggling parents and superiors every day drove her crazy and kept her indoors, and she insisted on afternoon deliveries of starbucks or milk tea to ease her headache. The company was expected to function normally after the outbreak, but a few days ago, the director informed that only online courses outstanding performance can smoothly back to work, minimum wage, which means that others may even lose their jobs.

The thought of escape still lingered in her mind, but to appease her family, she had to compromise. "I kept trying to convince myself that I would be okay after today, that I would just get through the day, and that I would just get through it until the epidemic was over. "

A disrupted resignation plan

Louise Lee had planned to ask his boss for his resignation years later.

She had worked for four years as an engineering cost engineer at a private company in Chongqing, calculating the cost of construction. Working with numbers is exhausting, sitting in front of a computer for a day, and all the nerves in your body hurt. She stayed up until 11:00 or 12:00 at night when she got off work, her mind was in a fog, and she would rather have taken a taxi to get back to the neighborhood, where she was locked out several times and had to wake up the sleeping security guard to open the door. This is not the life a 25-year-old girl wants. She's determined to make it to the end of the year.

After the Spring Festival, the epidemic became more and more serious. The company's work schedule was changed from Feb. 3 to Feb. 10, and the night before Feb. 10 it was announced that Louise Lee was working from home, disrupting his plans to resign, "It's not serious enough to send a wechat or an email, and you have to go to the company to go through the exit formalities. "

What she did not expect was that her immediate supervisor called her several days before the start of the year to urge her to plan the work. At first, Li Siqi also obediently perfunctory in the past, until another phone call, told her to take over a project.

She was very angry, Heart Murmur: clearly still on vacation, you give me sub-items, in case I do not do it? Simply a "I do not have time" throw over, the boss asked, "then what do you do at home? " She replied: "I do not do. " The boss hung up the phone. "I guess I was pissed off, " Louise Lee later recalled, "but I just wanted to leave and not take the project. "

When the epidemic hit, not everyone could be as free and easy as Li Siqi. According to a survey released by Zhaopin on February 2,64 percent of job-seekers have adjusted their job-hopping plans due to the outbreak, while 34 percent are on the fence.

Chen Yan is one of them. She just turned 22 this year and is a course consultant for a children's art organization in Guangzhou. The physical education industry has been hit hard by the outbreak. To protect its customers, her company mobilized on Wechat on Feb. 3. All teachers will give free tutoring classes to students during the outbreak, top performing campuses or employees get a bonus -- supposedly paid for by principals.

"Can you imagine how difficult it is to teach kindergarten children to draw through a screen? " Chen said. Returning to work online is at least twice as much work as normal classes, and there is no rest for the Lantern Festival. On average, each teacher has to tutor 30 students in a few days.

The official resumption of work this ten days, Chen Yan has no breathing space. One-on-one classes start at 10 a.m. , one hour at a time, and at the end of the day, you can tutor five or six students. 7:00 pm to 8:00 PM is a three-on-one Winter vacation class counseling, after 8:00 to hold two meetings, 10:00 or so can be over.

"sometimes I really don't want to work at all, just lying there, or even looking for someone else to fake my work for me. " When I was feeling sluggish, the director sent me a message in the morning, and she returned in the afternoon, and was reminded by the director that "if I can't do it well, I'll be eliminated. ".

Chen wanted to resign years later, but after the outbreak, the next few months are hard to find work, family advised her not to act rashly. The thought of resigning could not be suppressed, so she had to talk to her colleagues. Of the 17 people in her position, five were just as ready to quit as she was, but each time ended up discouraging the other.

"It's hard to find a job after a disaster if you talk less and do more in special times, " a colleague told Chen.

Value of work replays

The sudden outbreak has disrupted career plans for some young people, including Louise Lee and Chen Yan. Faced with possible layoffs, Lost Year End Bonuses, uncertain job prospects and the dangers of returning to work in the face of an epidemic, the factors that drive their career choices are back on the table: stability or high pay, health or money, the sense of meaning at work, the stage of life... For most people, struggle is the norm.

Louise Lee looked determined, and before that, he had wavered at least four times. "For four years, I resigned almost once a year, " Louise Lee added, "but I never made it. "

She's a four-year veteran, and the boss won't let her go. In 2018, she started leading the team, staying up until 4:00 in the morning for two months. During the day to ask the progress of the team members, convey the boss's orders, the hands of the project can not finish, several times in the office all night crying. She has offered to resign twice, the boss did not agree, first stop her hands of the project, and gave her a change of department.

"In fact, our company is very good, in Chongqing cost consulting industry is among the top, but I can not imagine myself doing this at 30, " said Louise Lee, who will turn 25 this year and wants to switch to his favorite painting and photography, worry about their own learning to achieve nothing, "their work is too busy, no time to learn, once quit, gave up the accumulation of these years, to learn other do not know how to start. "

It wasn't until last August, when she married her high school boyfriend of many years and was expecting a baby within two or three years, that she realized the clock was ticking and wrote two key words in her notebook about the life she wanted: freedom and Visual communication, resigns again.

"This time I was very determined. My boss talked me out of it for two hours and didn't change my mind. Finally, my boss gave me no choice but to be grateful and stay until the end of the year. "

Once again, Louise Lee confesses, there are other considerations besides human kindness: After getting used to being busy, she finds life without a job or an income terrifying. There is a typical "workaholic" in the colleagues, so busy that they have no time to chat with each other, except going to work or going home. Louise Lee couldn't help but compare herself. "everyone else is going up, " she says. "You quit your job like you're going down. "

The extended family vacation from the outbreak was the last thing she had to worry about. For more than a decade, Louise Lee had slept in and out of bed, doing what she liked, and sometimes watching Douban and Taobao was a day, unlike at work, when there was always something to be said no to, a freedom she hadn't felt in a long time.

"I don't feel happy at work except for money, " Louise Lee said, "But I can resign at this special time, first of all, I have financial security. I don't have a lot of savings, but I can last a year. I don't have a mortgage, I don't have a car, I don't have kids. I can just eat by myself. "

On the one hand, the double workload and potential danger after resuming work, and on the other hand, a life without work and income in the next few months, the doubangoose group came up with such a multiple choice question, the poll of 4,299 participants, starting on February 10th, do you want to go to work or quit, 92 percent of those polled said they wanted to go to work or take time off.

In the current outbreak, resignation is still in the minority. Photo / still from "never born"

Whether or not you have enough money saved seems to be the key to deciding whether to stay or go during an epidemic. In the group discussion on the same topic, "originally intended to resign after years, now what idea? " Under the answer "you have enough savings to live for a year and a half to resign, do not have money is poor" received 579 votes in favor.

For Chen, who was born in 1998, none of these factors were taken into account. Working from home, she felt, wasn't much of a risk for pneumonia, and though she complained, the workload doubled -- she was able to cope with the stress of her job, teaching, marketing, and even home visiting, the average person changes once a month, and she's been doing it for six months.

"What I can't accept is that the boss only likes brown-nosing people, and especially likes to snitch behind their backs, " Chen said, "I have had several close colleagues who have been let go by their bosses for various reasons, and the working environment has made me feel depressed. "

The market is predicting that the job market will not improve until May. Fortunately, she lives with her family in Guangzhou and has enough savings to last her six months without the pressure of renting an apartment or eating three meals.

"I'm more concerned about what my family thinks. They supported my resignation and even helped me figure out what to do, but years later it was hard to find a job. I was not self-disciplined and they worried that once I got used to the homelessness state, I wouldn't want to work,"Chen admitted, in the light but risky and hard but stable life, she chose the latter.

Reshuffled professional life

While the epidemic has put workers in a struggle, it has also reshuffled the fortunes of different industries. The catering, hotel, tourism and Physical Education Industries have suffered heavy losses in general, and some companies have begun to lay off workers. Along with the industry reshuffle is the fate of the people inside, the original years after the appointment of Phoebe unfortunately became cannon fodder.

At the end of last year, Phoebe, a new mother of eight months, made one of the most important decisions of her 34 years: to leave her accounting job with good benefits and become an English teacher.

For more than three decades before Chen, she had been drifting from major selection to graduate work, either arranged by her parents or following the situation. After graduation in the teacher's introduction to a smooth entry into a chemical enterprise to do finance, a do is ten years.

The company's welfare package was more than adequate in the third-tier city of Shandong where phoebe lived, but phoebe always had a desire to prove herself. "I always felt that this was not the life I had chosen, or even that it had been too easy. "

She grew up on English, want to be an English teacher, but never had the courage to give up everything. Late last year, six months after giving birth, she finally made up her mind to resign.

"people [ around me ] don't understand why I'm doing this in my 30s when they think I'm crazy, " she said. She asked close friends before quitting and, without exception, urged her not to. Suddenly there was a loss of financial resources, and her husband did not agree at first. phoebe felt aggrieved, "Why should my parents live here to take care of my children, and I still can't do a job I like and make more money to pay the mortgage than you? " The husband felt ashamed and said no more.

Her parents, who were counting on the safety of their children, also disagreed. "My mother told me that she would tell my fortune and that I would be promoted in two years. She told me to stay there and not go. " phoebe thought about giving up, but she gritted her teeth and insisted, "This is the only time in a person's life that I might have a chance to do something like this. In two or three years, I won't have the courage. "

After leaving her job, she had to interview more than 10 educational institutions before she was offered the job. Although the salary was half of her original job, she still punched in all kinds of software to learn English, hope for a new life.

Until HR's phone call to resign, she was still at home to prepare for the teacher certification. "The other side said that according to the development of the epidemic, it is estimated that there will be no students in the training institutions for three or four months. " After receiving the phone call, phoebe collapsed directly on the bed in the study, not knowing how to tell her family, "Now I'm really depressed, I'm useless, I doubt myself, and I even dream of going back to work every night. "

While phoebe's path to self-justification was thwarted by the epidemic, the nurse found a sense of worth in her job.

On the third day of the outbreak, "I've been wondering why I wanted to study medicine so badly since I started working, " she wrote on her personal microblog. Questioned, scolded, threatened, pushed, the beginning of medical school seems to be more and more ambiguous. I thought about giving up, I thought about changing careers, until this outbreak, and then it hit me: If I could, I would."

She comes from a family of doctors, her father runs a private clinic in a small town in Sichuan, and her mother works for the local health system. In her second grade essay, what do you want to be when you grow up? She wrote, I want to be a doctor.

"there is no special reason, study medicine is my obsession, I am more stubborn people, so adhere to down. " Then said.

When the university filled in the application form, because she read is the Liberal Arts, can not study the clinical, has applied for the nursing. After the internship, she smoothly into a neighboring city, a third-class hospital, began training rotation.

From cardiothoracic surgery to emergency department to Pediatrics, "endless meetings, endless errands, and tense doctor-patient relationship... I do not seem to find their own patients to save the original intention. "

The biggest shock was the night shift in the emergency department, where patients came one after another, and doctors were too busy rescuing dying grandfathers to care for 17, or 18 year old boys. At first the doctor also patiently explained that the boy's mother in a side anxious to roar, the doctor is also angry: "Don't you see that the heart stopped over there? Can Not wait? "

"everyone seems to live and die on their own, " he said. "We feel bad that one patient didn't make it, but there is another patient who has become numb to life and death. ".

In her first year, she considered changing her job to become a clinical trial coordinator in Chengdu, but the salary was too small to get a foothold in the big city. Her mother urged her to wait until after the program was over, and for two years.

Soon afterwards, pneumonia broke out in Wuhan. "after the news of the pneumonia in Wuhan in December came out, we thought it was quite normal. After a moment of tension, we were told it was not SARS. " After confirming signs of human transmission, then the hospital began to call for volunteer medical teams to go to the front.

"almost everyone in our department has signed up, 14 nurses, and the doctor who is retiring this summer, except for one very old teacher, who is also on the line because of her husband and daughter. " News coverage of the medical staff's deeds, click into the comments, are also praise, "most people can understand our hard work. ".

On New Year's Eve, she cried when she saw the news that the military doctor was on the front line, "medical staff know best how contagious the disease is, but they still sign up for the front line. It's a sense of mission, " she said. She saw nurses who had left their jobs regretting that they had resigned late, or You can fight on the front lines, and then I'm glad I'm still here.

Due to her lack of experience in ICU and smoking, she failed to get into the support team twice. She felt a bit lost, but soon consoled herself with a sentence, "'you go to the front, we defend our homes' , whether it is the front line or the rear, do things that have the same value, is to heal the sick. "

" After receiving the phone call, phoebe collapsed directly on the bed in the study, not knowing how to tell her family, "Now I'm really depressed, I'm useless, I doubt myself, and I even dream of going back to work every night. "

While phoebe's path to self-justification was thwarted by the epidemic, the nurse found a sense of worth in her job.

On the third day of the outbreak, "I've been wondering why I wanted to study medicine so badly since I started working, " she wrote on her personal microblog. Questioned, scolded, threatened, pushed, the beginning of medical school seems to be more and more ambiguous. I thought about giving up, I thought about changing careers, until this outbreak, and then it hit me: If I could, I would."

She comes from a family of doctors, her father runs a private clinic in a small town in Sichuan, and her mother works for the local health system. In her second grade essay, what do you want to be when you grow up? She wrote, I want to be a doctor.

"there is no special reason, study medicine is my obsession, I am more stubborn people, so adhere to down. " Then said.

When the university filled in the application form, because she read is the Liberal Arts, can not study the clinical, has applied for the nursing. After the internship, she smoothly into a neighboring city, a third-class hospital, began training rotation.

From cardiothoracic surgery to emergency department to Pediatrics, "endless meetings, endless errands, and tense doctor-patient relationship... I do not seem to find their own patients to save the original intention. "

The biggest shock was the night shift in the emergency department, where patients came one after another, and doctors were too busy rescuing dying grandfathers to care for 17, or 18 year old boys. At first the doctor also patiently explained that the boy's mother in a side anxious to roar, the doctor is also angry: "Don't you see that the heart stopped over there? Can Not wait? "

"everyone seems to live and die on their own, " he said. "We feel bad that one patient didn't make it, but there is another patient who has become numb to life and death. ".

In her first year, she considered changing her job to become a clinical trial coordinator in Chengdu, but the salary was too small to get a foothold in the big city. Her mother urged her to wait until after the program was over, and for two years.

Soon afterwards, pneumonia broke out in Wuhan. "after the news of the pneumonia in Wuhan in December came out, we thought it was quite normal. After a moment of tension, we were told it was not SARS. " After confirming signs of human transmission, then the hospital began to call for volunteer medical teams to go to the front.

"almost everyone in our department has signed up, 14 nurses, and the doctor who is retiring this summer, except for one very old teacher, who is also on the line because of her husband and daughter. " News coverage of the medical staff's deeds, click into the comments, are also praise, "most people can understand our hard work. ".

On New Year's Eve, she cried when she saw the news that the military doctor was on the front line, "medical staff know best how contagious the disease is, but they still sign up for the front line. It's a sense of mission, " she said. She saw nurses who had left their jobs regretting that they had resigned late, or You can fight on the front lines, and then I'm glad I'm still here.

Due to her lack of experience in ICU and smoking, she failed to get into the support team twice. She felt a bit lost, but soon consoled herself with a sentence, "'you go to the front, we defend our homes' , whether it is the front line or the rear, do things that have the same value, is to heal the sick. "

As of February 20, the state, the armed forces, provinces and municipalities have sent a total of 255 units of 32,572 medical personnel to support Wuhan. Photo / Sina Weibo, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University

Waiting for the outbreak to get better

Find the original intention, and then feel more responsible for their work, do chores also have a sense of meaning, "chores are also to save the service. ".

Under the epidemic, people feel self-imposed home quarantine, her pediatric patients greatly reduced. "Last night there were 19 patients, usually around 80-100 at this time. "

She found she was more patient with her patients'families, explaining the details of their medications and health knowledge to them, instead of the usual time she spent writing down her temperature and dispensing.

"When you learn to think about them, the family members aren't so hard to get along with, " she said, adding that she still planned to take the exam, but more to improve herself than to escape. "I'm sure nurses are something I want to do. "

Phoebe, who was laid off, also made sure that teaching English was still her dream job, but things could have worked out better.

"I should have listened to my family and friends and gotten my year-end bonus. If that had been the case, I wouldn't be out of work right now, " said Phoebe, who resigned years ago to allow time for new hires, but did not expect, one day still keep her leadership, the next morning let her go immediately.

"I really regret that I had a dream the other day that my company wanted me to work for them, " said Phoebe, who was unable to settle down for her teaching certificate for a week or so. Every day in various social media platforms: micro-blog "super talk pneumonia" , Zhihu "how to find a job after the epidemic" , as well as various wechat groups in the information. "is to avoid active thinking and passive receiving as much as possible. "

In order to calm her anxiety, she contacted the training institutions she had learned about immediately after receiving the phone call of her resignation. This time, she lowered her requirement to "English for young children. " Three of them said that there was no shortage of students. After the notice from the Education Bureau to resume teaching came down, she'll be called for an interview.

She still do not trust, and to the recruitment website to browse the information of the accounting position, do second-hand preparation. In addition, she plans to take the government-issued Public Institution exam at the end of March, with the goal of getting a satisfactory offer in early April.

Biffi, who is more than a decade younger, is less sanguine. "I don't think I'm going to make it to March. " Juggling parents and superiors every day drove her crazy and kept her indoors, and she insisted on afternoon deliveries of starbucks or milk tea to ease her headache. The company was expected to function normally after the outbreak, but a few days ago, the director informed that only online courses outstanding performance can smoothly back to work, minimum wage, which means that others may even lose their jobs.

The thought of escape still lingered in her mind, but to appease her family, she had to compromise. "I kept trying to convince myself that I would be okay after today, that I would just get through the day, and that I would just get through it until the epidemic was over. "
