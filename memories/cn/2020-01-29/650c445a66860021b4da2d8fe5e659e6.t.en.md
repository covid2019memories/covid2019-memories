Features, Lanxi, founder of zhulu.com  , focuses on in-depth observations and business reviews of Internet startups, new media, and subcultures.

Finally, more than, new cases of pneumonia have been confirmed nationwide, and the suspected number has gone straight to more than, .

Rationally, this is of course due to the decentralization of testing and the rebound in the supply of reagents, which is beginning to determine the number of patients who have been deposited, thus releasing a high number of new figures.

At the same time, however, it is worrying that the number of confirmed cases of pneumonia has easily surpassed that of SARS in 2003, and although the current mortality rate is only about half that of SARS, its rapid rate of infection, still Brings Back Memories of nightmares.

If there were another SARS outbreak, would we be better off than we were in 2003, as if the answer to that historical question were suddenly to be dismissed as pollyanna optimism.

I'm not going to repeat the Punch in the face argument, but I am going to say that advances in biotechnology are not the only parameters that affect the judgment on this issue, except for the bureaucracy that has been criticized for so long, advances in other kinds of technology can also create problems by mistake.

Like improvements in the transportation network.

Before 2003, there was no high speed rail in China, and the efficiency of mass transportation across provinces, was nothing compared to 17 years later, and the pressure of prevention and control was nothing like today.

There is also a passage in the recommended book "The coming of the virus" a few days ago, to the effect that a pair of boots, which had been treading Australian soil only in the morning, might pass through the swamps of the Amazon Rain Forest at night, this unprecedented development of transportation capacity, for the spread of the virus is a unique opportunity.

They say you can't cross the same river twice, but remember, the river itself can change, and 17 years apart, the river is not the same, only the stone in the middle of the river is always still.

Today is the fifth day of the Lunar New Year. According to the custom, it should be the day of worshipping the God of wealth.

Every time before today, Guiyuan Temple in Wuhan from early morning will be packed to capacity, crowded to the point where shoes will be trampled, temple incense flourishing, smoke filled, each bodhisattva face, all hang up a bright smile.

In recent years, due to safety concerns, more controls have been imposed and the public is no longer allowed to arrive early. Guiyuan Temple is not open at night at all, and I go less often and do not see much anymore, but I hear that the traffic is still heavy during the day, even the vendor selling sesame cakes at the gate of the temple had to hire two extra workers on a temporary basis, or he would not be able to handle the customers.

On the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, Guiyuan Temple should be really "cold" . Money is important, but it is no match for life, and most likely, no one will have good fortune in 2020.

Manufacturing, retail, services, tourism... All thinking ahead about how to cut their losses, yes, fight the epidemic, but don't forget about production, which has been frozen for too long, along with economic activity.

Among friends, entrepreneurs talk of a cloud of gloom, and even Liu Qiangdong's sincere attempt to encourage one another by telling the story of his transformation into JD.com during SARS.

It was Wang Xing who coined the phrase, "2019 may be the worst year of the past decade, but it could also be the best year of the next decade. ". "

Don't be so precise..

Oh, and by the way, 2020, that's 8% gone, you realize that?

This is my diary of the siege of Wuhan, day seven.
