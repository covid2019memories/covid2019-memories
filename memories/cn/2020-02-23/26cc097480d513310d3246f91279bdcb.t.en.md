After 30 long days, I don't know if I can write another 30 days. Colleagues have one after another to return to work, there are ordinary train bumpy back, hundreds of take a black car from the countryside to take the path, and others and other car-sharing self-driving. Xi'an just out of the resumption of work policy only need to do nucleic acid testing, without isolation for 14 days, take the results directly to work, I really do? I also want to go back, after the lifting of the seal to buy a ticket, they told me not to take any chances, all the hard-hit areas concentrated isolation.

Friends to share a grab box horse tips, tried and true, Taobao points to open Taoxianda, 21:59 cut to the shopping cart interface, better than the Horse App grab many, APP always crashed at the point, refresh directly after the prompt "today orders are full. ". I used Taoxianda Rob several times, the success rate is high, but as more and more people know this method, Taoxianda also began to crack hard to grab, grab single failure three days in a row.

Last night he ma community assistant in the group to increase capacity, store orders increased to 1,300 single, the result of 3 seconds empty, the group reported that after adding orders more difficult to buy food, the whole family can not go out to grab fresh. The prices of vegetables purchased by the group are still within acceptable range. The frozen meat set meal is really expensive and exaggerated. Our community organized a group of frozen meat, ranging from 280-360 yuan for five catties of meat, seafood > Pork > Beef > chicken > aquatic products (River Fish) . During the Hema epidemic, the price was not raised and the quality was guaranteed, that's why everyone's so focused on the blackjack.

There is an online "Wuhan sister-in-law group against people" video, listen to very comfortable (release gas) , I watched three or four times. Wuhan words really fit to scold each other, gas field full open, the key to this aunt gas, clear, accurate expression, there is a say one, and did not find crooked (unreasonable) . Aunt said set meal set is not reasonable, and said the city has been relying on households to save themselves, the property is not to do anything also love to complain, the end of the use of a number of four-word idioms, slurs master.

Over the past few days, people have been forwarding chat screenshots one after another. "there have been several cases of infection / suspected cases in so-and-so residential areas, and they don't go out at all at ordinary times. That is, they are making group purchases to get vegetables these days. " "SO-AND-SO COMMUNITY GROUP A fruit, have a home to eat, have been sent to the shelter quarantine, " and then appealed to the residents, "a total of difficult times, less than the last meter, do not eat the refrigerator empty, do not buy vegetables randomly group, " and saw many people in the group respond, even suggested the property to make an announcement, I really have no words, to eat up all the family's inventory and then group purchase is very unrealistic, 80% of the vegetable package is green leafy vegetables, can not match themselves on demand, also can not increase or decrease weight at will, leafy vegetables are not put up, after the temperature rose, the swing balcony rotted away within a few days.

The most economical way is to buy enough vegetables for 3 days at a time, and then eat the new vegetables, but the set meal is 5 Jin 10 Jin, the weight is too big, the family of three is not a rabbit, relying on eating vegetables to eat full, consumption speed can not catch up with the speed of deterioration of vegetables. If the call in the group, a week to buy food, the best half a month once, may eat to the end only rotten leaves. If I had a "Wuhan sister-in-law" hot temper, would have been in the group voice against people, but I am relatively weak, quietly retweeting popular science articles and expert video (feeling no one click open to see) .

The virus has survived on takeout bags, vegetable meat and eggs, and cardboard boxes for so little time, my friend and I complained that we would rather believe a few screenshots of each other than popular science, i initially retweeted articles and links, patiently popularizing the science, hoping that residents would not listen to the wind and rain, which only increased panic, but persuading middle-aged and elderly people to be rational was much more difficult than the original "how to persuade elders to wear masks" .

Later, my friend told me that perhaps now group buying too much, there are interests between merchants dispute, deliberately released "group buying too often get sick" of the news. There's a group-buying store in her neighborhood, small business, selling home-grown vegetables at a much cheaper price than a big-box store, and the whole family's group meal was reported yesterday. I asked a question mark all over my face. It is good for residents to buy quality and cheap vegetables. What is the reason for reporting the business? She said that the reason was disturbing the people. The night and early morning picking and sorting affected the rest. The seller who was reported finally "voluntarily" withdrew from the group and stopped taking orders, now the whole community can only change the business re-connected.

The hotel across the street from our neighborhood had a provincial aid medical team, and last night someone in the group posted some photos of why the hotel across the street suddenly had so many lights on, whether or not to put the nearby quarantined patients in. For a while many residents began to panic, close to home, and often open the window, quite a kind of "virus with the air floating over how to do" the puzzle of worry. Later, the property staff went to the street to verify that it was the medical workers who had come to the rescue. The tense atmosphere in the group suddenly eased down a lot, and the residents again turned to enthusiastic praise and cheer, i hope the epidemic is over soon (I always look puzzled in my chat) .

Yesterday after dinner, I stood in the balcony daze, found that the isolation building gate has a Meituan takeout boy, should be the residents of the community, they now go out convenient, open a good certificate, daily delivery interval can also buy some food for their own. Look at him out of the trunk of apples and bananas, two small baskets of eggs and a few bundles of vegetables, arms full, with his elbow ringing the doorbell. Now there are still restaurants that insist on opening their doors, selling fresh vegetables and frozen meat directly, business is particularly brisk, monthly sales are several thousand, yesterday I ordered Ginger and garlic and other spices, the boss contacted me and said that the scallions are all rotten, give me a refund, other vegetables normal hair, forgive me if I'm wrong, but there are hundreds of orders in this store every day, and they're packed from morning till night.

There is a convenience store at the gate of the community, the owner and his wife live in the store, after the closure of the city by the property into the household group, we buy supplies directly in the group to ask, send a red envelope to the boss, then make an appointment to go downstairs to take. I once happened to meet a pickup site, residents standing at the gate, shouting through the railing "I'm coming" , the boss will send something from the crack in the door. The young man bought a large bottle of coke, a few packets of Lay's potato chips and peanuts, coke and the drunkard peanuts could be handed over from the middle of the railing, the chips were inflated, the boss tried several times but couldn't get them in, turned around and went back to the store to get a plastic bag and wrapped the chips separately, from the gap at the bottom of the gate to the men, the whole process really feel like anti-japanese smuggling materials.

From the windowsill outside the living room, we could see the kitchen on the opposite floor (I feel like a perv watching other people) . Our family ate early, because everyone was so bored at home, cooking and washing dishes became one of the most "entertaining ways" to pass the time, after dinner, it was not dark yet, others might have just started to cook dinner. I found several times that the residents of the opposite building were very synchronized. Every time it was around 6:30, four or five kitchens were all lit up to cook, the Big Wok was turned up and down, and one person was responsible for cooking, one person is responsible for bringing in and out food and serving it with food.

One family also has a gluttonous children, his mother in cooking, he snuck into the kitchen to eat, his mother turned around to see the children directly with their hands vegetables, seems to be quite angry, criticized a few words, the dishes to his front guard. If a family is cooking with hot oil, you can still hear the crackling sound, in addition to the continuous news broadcast on TV, the neighbors cooking sound became a kind of relief and healing, as if a new, silent communication between residents of the same community.

At six o'clock, everyone went into the kitchen to prepare that evening's dinner, as if to prove that the whole family is safe and healthy, if the family is sick, I am afraid there is no leisure to cook, just a few. The familiar fireworks add a touch of pathos to a quiet night, when gentle evening winds blow from the lake, bringing moist moisture. Downstairs for a walk with the dog, the children had arranged to play a game. Originally, it was a good time for walking and eating. Now, there was no one to be seen downstairs. It was rare to see a resident who took out the garbage. After throwing away the garbage, he ran home as fast as he could. The Red Lantern on the street lamp was still on time, there are far-off Wanda Plaza Lights, if the winter night for wanton celebration, spring night is suitable for the shallow end of the sad.

His novels are full of fantasy, with many elements of ghosts, customs and artistry. His love story begins with Romance and ends with sadness, sadness and despair.

One of my favorite books is "love on the island of Tang" . The names of the male lead, Tsuyoshi Tsukue, and the female lead, Yoshi, are very beautiful. The meeting between the two when they were young is beautifully written. From the perspective of Yoshi, a little outline of the full picture of the young CATALPA: "seventeen-year-old early summer, this farewell to the late spring before the heavy rain, in the Dark Street, two people met... Rice shop early closed the door, three or two lights through the rope curtain outside the door, rice shop lights dim. ". A young man with a jade face stood quietly with his back to the rice shop and his kerosene lamp in his hand

There's an update on the exciting chocolate brand, prescu'Le Chocolaterie, in Tokyo, "Pistachio Jam has a strong flavor, Strawberry Jelly has a pleasant sweetness, and the slightly sour taste makes the pistachio taste better. The top of the chocolate is decorated with a few dried strawberries, the strong sour taste finally stimulates the taste buds, the whole eating down only sigh with mature and steady, fascinating, if the rose lychees are romantic and sweet with love, Strawberry Pistachio is the long-term flow of feelings into the life of the old couple. There are 4,8,12 three kinds of packaging, miss 12 flavors give a very high rating, highly recommended to buy.

He participated in two online discussions organized by 706, one on the controversial quarantine of the epidemic and the other on mask prices and government regulation. It was more than two hours long, and then there was a group discussion. If you had time, you could sign up for more of these discussions. The participants came from different fields, different ages and social experiences, and had very different ideas about the same issue. When we talk about quarantine, I find it interesting to compare it to viruses and Emojis, both of which have the attributes of replication → transmission → adaptation / Mutation → retransmission. In the case of pneumonia, we choose containment and quarantine, facing the information flow and the dissemination, we also choose to build the wall to break the net.

Friends who read my diary asked me if I was tired of keeping up with the news. Each article was full of many words, and I felt that I was neither a frontline worker nor a journalist, so I could go to the front to update the report. It's like you can't write anything without a long dry exposé, without a rousing story. I feel that any ordinary resident, or out-of-town friends, can record what they saw and thought in this epidemic, record their own cities and lives. We are all witnesses, we are all individuals who have experienced the epidemic first-hand, and an individual who can tell the true story to the next generation, to the next generation.

"We have to remember that every generation is saying that kids today are hopeless. When I was in school, people in the class of' 77 and' 78 said, 'look what people are after level 80, what will China do in the future? '. To my generation to see, I read with my son, he can not read a lot of things, he does not know what is a millstone, what is a millstone, what is a sickle, neither know nor seen. In this case, you tend to think, what about the next generation? It doesn't matter. Every generation is great. They'll find a way to save themselves. There's a self-educating side to human nature, and of course there's a fooling side to human nature, but there's also a side to human nature that breaks free of lies.

It's important to trust people. And believing in people is one of the most important foundations of modern civilization. First of all, people are not abstract people, people are concrete people. Secondly, people are People Without Borders, people in China, people in another country, people like us. We're all the same. We're all the same. The Devil, the Saint, they're all human. It's important to note that. Where does hope come from? It comes from people.

There's an old saying, "where there's a man, there's hope. ". That is to say, you don't have to look at the kids today and say stupid things like that. It doesn't matter. They will become like us in the future. Of course we have a responsibility to help them, just as their parents have a responsibility to educate them; but they will find their own way, just as we found a way to educate ourselves when we were young."[ from a conversation between Surplus value and MS Rosin ] 

Yan Lianke's opening speech at Hkust's online course also affirmed the special value of the individual in the grand story, eNCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE MINDFUL: "If you can't speak up, be a whisperer; if you can't be a whisperer, be a silent person with a memory and a memory... stand aside and be a person with a grave in your heart; if you have a memory imprint; if you can one day transfer that memory into your own memory for posterity. " (I recommend reading the full text, for fear that the diary will be harmonised. Science online is needed.)

After 30 long days, I don't know if I can write another 30 days. Colleagues have one after another to return to work, there are ordinary train bumpy back, hundreds of take a black car from the countryside to take the path, and others and other car-sharing self-driving.

At six o'clock, everyone went into the kitchen to prepare that evening's dinner, as if to prove that the whole family is safe and healthy, if the family is sick, I am afraid there is no leisure to cook, just a few. The familiar fireworks add a touch of pathos to a quiet night, when gentle evening winds blow from the lake, bringing moist moisture. Downstairs for a walk with the dog, the children had arranged to play a game. Originally, it was a good time for walking and eating. Now, there was no one to be seen downstairs. It was rare to see a resident who took out the garbage. After throwing away the garbage, he ran home as fast as he could. The Red Lantern on the street lamp was still on time, there are far-off Wanda Plaza Lights, if the winter night for wanton celebration, spring night is suitable for the shallow end of the sad.

One of my favorite books is "love on the island of Tang" . The names of the male lead, Tsuyoshi Tsukue, and the female lead, Yoshi, are very beautiful. The meeting between the two when they were young is beautifully written. From the perspective of Yoshi, a little outline of the full picture of the young CATALPA: "seventeen-year-old early summer, this farewell to the late spring before the heavy rain, in the Dark Street, two people met... Rice shop early closed the door, three or two lights through the rope curtain outside the door, rice shop lights dim. ". A young man with a jade face stood quietly with his back to the rice shop and his kerosene lamp in his hand

There's an update on the exciting chocolate brand, prescu'Le Chocolaterie, in Tokyo, "Pistachio Jam has a strong flavor, Strawberry Jelly has a pleasant sweetness, and the slightly sour taste makes the pistachio taste better. The top of the chocolate is decorated with a few dried strawberries, the strong sour taste finally stimulates the taste buds, the whole eating down only sigh with mature and steady, fascinating, if the rose lychees are romantic and sweet with love, Strawberry Pistachio is the long-term flow of feelings into the life of the old couple. There are 4,8,12 three kinds of packaging, miss 12 flavors give a very high rating, highly recommended to buy.

He participated in two online discussions organized by 706, one on the controversial quarantine of the epidemic and the other on mask prices and government regulation. It was more than two hours long, and then there was a group discussion. If you had time, you could sign up for more of these discussions. The participants came from different fields, different ages and social experiences, and had very different ideas about the same issue. When we talk about quarantine, I find it interesting to compare it to viruses and Emojis, both of which have the attributes of replication → transmission → adaptation / Mutation → retransmission. In the case of pneumonia, we choose containment and quarantine, facing the information flow and the dissemination, we also choose to build the wall to break the net.

Friends who read my diary asked me if I was tired of keeping up with the news. Each article was full of many words, and I felt that I was neither a frontline worker nor a journalist, so I could go to the front to update the report. It's like you can't write anything without a long dry exposé, without a rousing story. I feel that any ordinary resident, or out-of-town friends, can record what they saw and thought in this epidemic, record their own cities and lives. We are all witnesses, we are all individuals who have experienced the epidemic first-hand, and an individual who can tell the true story to the next generation, to the next generation.

"We have to remember that every generation is saying that kids today are hopeless. When I was in school, people in the class of' 77 and' 78 said, 'look what people are after level 80, what will China do in the future? '. To my generation to see, I read with my son, he can not read a lot of things, he does not know what is a millstone, what is a millstone, what is a sickle, neither know nor seen. In this case, you tend to think, what about the next generation? It doesn't matter. Every generation is great. They'll find a way to save themselves. There's a self-educating side to human nature, and of course there's a fooling side to human nature, but there's also a side to human nature that breaks free of lies.

It's important to trust people. And believing in people is one of the most important foundations of modern civilization. First of all, people are not abstract people, people are concrete people. Secondly, people are People Without Borders, people in China, people in another country, people like us. We're all the same. We're all the same. The Devil, the Saint, they're all human. It's important to note that. Where does hope come from? It comes from people.

There's an old saying, "where there's a man, there's hope. ". That is to say, you don't have to look at the kids today and say stupid things like that. It doesn't matter. They will become like us in the future. Of course we have a responsibility to help them, just as their parents have a responsibility to educate them; but they will find their own way, just as we found a way to educate ourselves when we were young."[ from a conversation between Surplus value and MS Rosin ] 

Yan Lianke's opening speech at Hkust's online course also affirmed the special value of the individual in the grand story, eNCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE MINDFUL: "If you can't speak up, be a whisperer; if you can't be a whisperer, be a silent person with a memory and a memory... stand aside and be a person with a grave in your heart; if you have a memory imprint; if you can one day transfer that memory into your own memory for posterity. " (I recommend reading the full text, for fear that the diary will be harmonised. Science online is needed.)

He participated in two online discussions organized by 706, one on the controversial quarantine of the epidemic and the other on mask prices and government regulation. It was more than two hours long, and then there was a group discussion. If you had time, you could sign up for more of these discussions. The participants came from different fields, different ages and social experiences, and had very different ideas about the same issue. When we talk about quarantine, I find it interesting to compare it to viruses and Emojis, both of which have the attributes of replication → transmission → adaptation / Mutation → retransmission. In the case of pneumonia, we choose containment and quarantine, facing the information flow and the dissemination, we also choose to build the wall to break the net.

Friends who read my diary asked me if I was tired of keeping up with the news. Each article was full of many words, and I felt that I was neither a frontline worker nor a journalist, so I could go to the front to update the report. It's like you can't write anything without a long dry exposé, without a rousing story. I feel that any ordinary resident, or out-of-town friends, can record what they saw and thought in this epidemic, record their own cities and lives. We are all witnesses, we are all individuals who have experienced the epidemic first-hand, and an individual who can tell the true story to the next generation, to the next generation.

"We have to remember that every generation is saying that kids today are hopeless. When I was in school, people in the class of' 77 and' 78 said, 'look what people are after level 80, what will China do in the future? '. To my generation to see, I read with my son, he can not read a lot of things, he does not know what is a millstone, what is a millstone, what is a sickle, neither know nor seen. In this case, you tend to think, what about the next generation? It doesn't matter. Every generation is great. They'll find a way to save themselves. There's a self-educating side to human nature, and of course there's a fooling side to human nature, but there's also a side to human nature that breaks free of lies.

It's important to trust people. And believing in people is one of the most important foundations of modern civilization. First of all, people are not abstract people, people are concrete people. Secondly, people are People Without Borders, people in China, people in another country, people like us. We're all the same. We're all the same. The Devil, the Saint, they're all human. It's important to note that. Where does hope come from? It comes from people.

There's an old saying, "where there's a man, there's hope. ". That is to say, you don't have to look at the kids today and say stupid things like that. It doesn't matter. They will become like us in the future. Of course we have a responsibility to help them, just as their parents have a responsibility to educate them; but they will find their own way, just as we found a way to educate ourselves when we were young."[ from a conversation between Surplus value and MS Rosin ]
