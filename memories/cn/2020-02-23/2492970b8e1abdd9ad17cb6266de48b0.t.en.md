Function introduction, care about every ordinary Chinese life revolution.

Companionship is the most valuable human care that social resonance can provide when a chaotic society is too busy to care for a specific person's voice. Even if you can't really meet your needs right away, an immediate response and reassurance is better than no response at all. "At least let him feel that he is not an island. "

When society is faced with extreme situations, voluntary organizations formed spontaneously by citizens can be an important complement to the shutdown of the machine.

The mutual aid groups for medical travel, the angel team of masks and the information docking platform for medical supplies, which we have reported before, have formed a kind of hub or platform on the front line of the Wuhan Epidemic, the problem of part operation of the medical system under the chaotic state of the city was solved in time. Today, we want to talk about social workers and communities, and an online volunteer social work team called social worker resonance.

In this outbreak, community as the smallest form of social management has been fully mobilized. According to the 2012-2020 plan for the distribution of community sites in Wuhan Central City, 985 communities serve more than 11 million permanent residents, and the standard for serving population in central communities is 15,000-30,000 people.

Under the epidemic situation, facing such huge crowd and urgent meticulous management request, the introduction of professional social workers to assist in information screening and resource allocation under the overload condition of the original community workers, there is a hidden need for broader prevention and psychological intervention that was previously ignored.

In the mainland, the awareness of social workers is still largely confined to voluntary charitable services. However, in developed countries such as Europe and America, as well as in Hong Kong, social workers have completed the process of professionalization and specialization, and their participation in social services and development has formed an effective method to solve social problems.

We can understand "social worker resonance" as the intermediary between Wuhan residents and communities, hospitals, centralized isolation points, or buffer layer. Their intervention may not directly solve many of Wuhan's immediate problems, but not all of them can be solved in an immediate manner.

Professional Rescue

Yu Zhihong is the designer of social worker resonance. She was also a sociology professor at Wuhan University and a native of Wuhan.

With the closing of the Han corridor and the suspension of public transport in the city at 10 am on January 23, Wuhan was plunged into its most frantic moment since the outbreak. Before the arrival of the top-down support force, the strong sense of isolated island prompted a large number of voluntary groups spontaneously formed, self-help has become the most central topic of Wuhan People.

How to participate in this emergency rescue as a scholar is a question that Yu Zhihong has been thinking about for several days. The next day, she set up a university community docking group and gathered a group of social work teachers, hoping to put together a plan to support the work of frontline social workers in Wuhan.

In Yu's view, the form of the social hotline is no longer sufficient to support the current situation in Wuhan, "It's more like a band-aid. It works when the call comes in, but it's the next connection, and a lot of things have to be redone. And for the people of Wuhan, the most urgent need now is to solve the problem of survival, not just psychological comfort."

The establishment of a targeted and sustained service system, linking social workers, psychological and medical volunteers, and relying on specific communities to sink into the residents, is Yu Zhihong's view that the more appropriate mode of operation at present. "And it has to be done online. The value of a social worker is not in rushing to the front line to deliver food, but in being able to serve more people in a short period of time. "

The program is what she calls the "2 + 3" model of online community sink versus epidemic. "2" refers to local community workers and online volunteer social workers, and "3" refers to online medical volunteers, psychological volunteers and social worker assistants. The team of volunteers, led by social workers, will be assigned to a three-tier defense model, ranging from healthy community residents to fever isolators to confirmed patients and suspected cases, to provide the corresponding help service for the different demand crowd.

The "2 + 3" model of community submersion and epidemic prevention designed by Yuzhihong

The Model sinks down to the large number of volunteers needed by the community, on the one hand from the Wuhan University's student resources. Jiang Jiang and Hu Yue, who helped Ms. Yu form her team in the first place, are her former students, and the core coordination team is largely made up of her social work students, most of whom were initially recruited from Wuhan University's previous medical students.

On the other hand, Yu's network of universities and academic organizations around the world. In addition to passion, professionalism and practical experience are the "social worker resonance" recruitment volunteers especially social workers and psychological volunteers hard target.

Heilongjiang's Longjiang social worker is so far the only team to join the "social worker resonance" , including psychological, social workers, medical treatment, a total of more than 30 volunteers. According to Niu Yang, a volunteer social worker, Yu connected with Huang Hong, director of the Institute of Sociology at the Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, to access social work resources in Heilongjiang.

The volunteers who participated in the rescue in Wuhan had to pass the strict qualification examination of the Longjiang Supervision Group of social workers. The selected social workers basically had intermediate social worker certificates and had many years of teaching or practical experience.

Niu Yang himself was one of the first 4105 social workers to pass the professional examination in 2008. She was involved in the 2018 Harbin 825 major fire accident social workers volunteer relief work, in her impression, this is the Heilongjiang post-disaster social work opportunity, is also her more than 10 years of experience in social work, a turning point for the real and rapid improvement of the practical ability.

Gu Min, the head of the group, is from Shanghai. She has worked as an EAP (enterprise employee psychological assistance) for more than 10 years in a 200-strong state-owned enterprise. At weekends, she works as a psychological consultant in a psychological counseling organization designated by the Shanghai Education Bureau. She saw the "social worker resonance" message among the students in mid-durban.

"I was joking with my teacher that the Wuhan community was very good and I came to Zhongdurban to recruit people, " he said, referring to one of the earliest professional training programs in the field of psychological counseling in China, gu Min is part of a continuous training program in psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy in China and Germany. The program is open to students from all over the country. In the end, less than 200 students were approved.

The first large-scale psychological intervention in the country for people affected by the disaster began with the 2008 Wenchuan County earthquake. But in that year's post-disaster rescue, a "fire and theft prevention psychological consultant" proverb is widely spread, which refers to the time by the unprofessional, unorganized psychological rescue brought secondary harm.

In response to the Wuhan Epidemic this time, Gu Min introduced to me the online rescue plan of the psychological volunteer group, the ethical protection principle of consulting by joining an assistant with the consent of the person seeking help, the arrangement of consulting records in real time, the introduction of the supervision of a psychological consultant with experience in crisis intervention, the daily seminar and other measures, at least architecturally, there is a certain amount of patterniness.

In the face of major disasters, when all eyes are on the overall situation and order, many tragedies often occur in the neglect of the individual. In a complete disaster response mechanism, the rescue of social emotions needs to be initiated simultaneously.

Go to the community

Based on the mobilization of local universities and professional organizations, there are now more than 400 volunteers in the "social worker Resonance" reserve all over the country. How to transport this large number of civilian volunteers to the Wuhan Community, is the next problem of Yu Zhihong.

The "2 + 3" plan actually spread quickly among social workers. Yu Zhihong told me that she was contacted by the Hubei Social Workers Union on January 30, the day the article was published, in a post on the public account, and that the model has now been incorporated into the social workers intervention guide by the Wuhan Social Workers Union.

But to get down to the concrete streets and neighborhoods, professional recognition isn't enough to get her to act quickly. I wonder how she can win the trust and cooperation of the district government. After all, social work is still a new thing in the mainland, and the pace of professionalization is still far behind.

In the past, opportunities and space for social workers to work with the community were also limited. It was usually when the Home Affairs Bureau (Hab) purchased services from social work agencies that social workers would be connected to the communities and streets concerned to provide services. And this outbreak is an unprecedented challenge for all segments of society.

Yu's teaching experience at the Wuhan University has helped her accumulate resources from well established local social work organizations. The scheme was launched on 29 January at the Chak Pei Social Work Service Centre to serve Pak Sha Chau in Wuchang District and Taipei road in Jiang'an District. It was founded in 2014 in Wuhan as a non-profit NGO and an internship unit she had previously contacted for social work students.

After two days to help ze Pei up and running, Yu Zhihong immediately moved to the Kong Hon district to establish their own "social worker resonance" team. Kong Hon is one of the hardest hit areas in Wuhan. As an old city, the population density is high, the degree of aging is more serious, the residents'ability to obtain information and protect themselves is relatively weak, and the pressure of community work is accordingly increased.

Through her friend Chen Yu, who has been in charge of the youth space in Jianghan District for years, Yu quickly contacted the person in charge of Beihu Street. It went better than she thought.

"This outbreak came so suddenly that everyone continued to operate in the usual pattern. Many streets will hesitate to open their doors. After all, we are folk volunteers. When you're running for your life, it's very unlikely that the government or the community will ever think about it."

But "social worker resonance" must fall back into the community. In the current urban control program in Wuhan, the screening of fever patients, the arrangement of free transportation, the life service of centralized isolation personnel and so on need to contact the community. Community is the shortest way and the only way for Wuhan residents to get medical treatment and life help.

In particular, following the announcement by the Epidemic Command on February 2 that centralized treatment and isolation of "four categories of people" must be completed, and the announcement on February 11 that all residential areas throughout the city will be under closed management, community and temporary centralized quarantine site staff have in fact become one of the most stressful groups to work outside of medical staff.

"The community is our most basic social organization, and if the community is disorganized, our whole society will be greatly impacted. The needs of many residents are very practical, and if you leave the community, your work will not go on. "

In the previous scenario, the volunteers would go directly to the original community grid and connect all the residents in the cluster, but this non-hierarchical, non-screening approach relies heavily on the volunteer's personal enthusiasm, and the activity of the cluster is often not very high.

"It would be valuable to be able to sink to all the grid clusters, because you would be able to reach the majority of the population. But this approach requires tapping into a large number of wechat groups, making it difficult to select residents who are motivated to participate in the interaction. At present, we do not have enough human resources, so it is easy to cause human waste."

So in collaboration with Kong Hon, social worker resonance has created several targeted group chats in addition to its presence on the grid, including Popular Science, parent-child, elderly consultation, home care, Hotel Care, hotel staff support, through the grid group to recruit residents in need into the group.

On February 1, six new wechat groups called "social worker resonance" were launched.

Valuable Company

The first call for help came at 10:56 p.m. in the Home Care Group.

"Good evening, brothers and sisters! My family has had a fever since the 22nd and it has been running high for more than 10 days. This afternoon I can hardly speak, I can not walk, I can hardly breathe. Please, I have no resources to help. "

The caller, Tian Ting (not her real name) , was not in Wuhan. Her brother, who was in critical condition that day, was called 120 and sent to Wuhan's Fifth Hospital for treatment, but could not be admitted because he had not yet received the quota for nucleic acid tests, she's been calling community and lung hospitals all day.

At the same time, another caller, Ms. Yin (not her real name) , also sent out a long message in the group. Doctors diagnosed her 77 year old mother with COVID-19 pneumonia, but the community hospital and the East West Lake People's Hospital could not immediately arrange for confirmation and admission.

She now takes care of the children at her home in east West Lake, while her husband takes care of her mother and her mentally challenged sister in Hanyang. She hopes to use social worker resonance to secure hospital beds.

The two messages in the group are clear and consistent in their need to get their loved ones out of isolation at home and into the hospital for treatment. But in the "2 + 3" three-level defense model, home escort group belongs to the second-level Defense, specifically for the home isolation of the fever crowd to provide guidance, advice, comfort, not directly into the hospital. The community is a dead end.

According to the classification of fever residents in Wuhan, which has been fully implemented since January 24, cases of fever still need to be reported through community hospitals, despite the announcement by the headquarters that designated fever clinics can not refuse patients for any reason, the transport of patients to designated hospitals is also centrally arranged by the districts.

When Tian Ting and Yin asked for help, Chen Yu, a social worker, was the first to respond. After asking about their specific neighborhood and community, Liu Yang, a psychologist, immediately followed up and posted, "I see your frustration and frustration. If I were you, I'd be crazy. You're doing great. You're strong. You're rational. "

Another social worker, Joyce Giann Wong, began guiding Tian to provide more detailed and accurate information. After she uploaded the patient's blood work report and CT images, Li Yiyi, a medical volunteer, followed up and made a preliminary assessment, reassuring Tian that her brother's blood test did not necessarily show new pneumonia.

Li Yi appeared in the group, Ms. Yin immediately sent her mother's CT image and her own identity card to the group, and Directly@her, implore "Dr. Li" to help diagnose.

After midnight, Yu began using his resources to contact the hospital, while the social worker in the group continued to ask Ms. Yin one specific and simple question after another, how she's doing tonight, whether she's sleeping, whether you're with her, whether you have oxygen in the house, gradually shifting the narrative from Catharsis to debriefing.

The group's communication lasted until nearly 1 a.m. The next morning, Ms. Yin's mother was in critical condition. She and her husband again called for help in the group. The mood that had eased the night before became heated again. Ms Yin's mother was not admitted to Hanyang Hospital, which had been trying to contact her all night, but was unable to reach her, "If it would save my mother's life, I would die at once! "

Yu Zhihong has foreseen the inevitable occurrence of this situation, and also knows that "social worker resonance" Can not actually meet the needs of hospital beds for help seekers at present, the home escort group can play a more role in preventive emotional intervention.

"One steps into the abyss. The part of them that gets mad is in a state of utter despair. If we don't want to accumulate this social emotion, we have to intervene before she gets to this point, we have to respond to her, we have to help her, we have to give her information, and with that information she feels confident."

The recent "social worker Resonance" team is doing an expert course on grief counseling

Finally, with the help of "social worker resonance, " Ms. Yin's mother was placed on a priority follow-up list in the corresponding community. As it turned out, the help seemed to be only slightly better than it had been, and the underlying problem was not immediately solved.

Niu Yang, a social worker volunteer, had a hard time believing that such a purely online social worker intervention would actually help residents. The hotel escort she was assigned to was also a secondary defense, facing dozens of residents concentrated in isolation at the Yue Hotel.

Cases like Ms. Yin's don't happen every day. More often than not, Niu Yang has to deal with daily needs like no toilet paper in the room, bad taste in food, and helping to collect things. But this kind of question still needs the hotel to separate the spot staff to solve finally, "what we play is a buffer function. "

On Feb. 4, a mother-in-law in her 60s who was quarantined at the Yue hotel called for help. Her husband had been diagnosed with new pneumonia and had spent many days at the intensive-care unit, but she had just received a phone call from him saying his room had been moved downstairs, it's like the hospital's trying to get rid of him.

The day before, when the hospital issued the death notice, the community workers had already taken the risk of consuming five sets of protective clothing to accompany the old woman to visit her husband. Now the mother-in-law wants to go to the hospital again, perhaps to see her husband for the last time.

In the end, this requirement can not be met with multiple communications. Niu and his colleagues wondered if they could contact a doctor at a Red Cross hospital to shoot a video of their mother-in-law's wife.

When he signed up to participate in the "Social Worker Resonance" program, Niu did not expect that the actual situation in Wuhan would be so serious, "In the face of many problems that should be solvable in normal times, in special circumstances it is really unable to solve. " Inevitably, she developed a strong sense of empathy and powerlessness.

Even though most of the volunteers have substantial practical experience and a strong theoretical background, "when we get involved, we learn so much that outsiders can't see through their conversations and circles of friends. "

Gu Min, a volunteer who was also involved in the case, said she and other counselors had envisioned online counseling using a variety of psychological tools in their preparation, for example, to adjust the cognitive, stimulate their own enthusiasm, short exchange of exceptional questions, but "really is the face of the service object, we do more or listening, empathy and companionship. "
Companionship is the most valuable human care that "social resonance" can provide when a chaotic society is too busy to care for a specific person's voice. Even if you can't really meet the demand immediately, immediate response and comfort is always better than no one cares.

"At least let him feel that he is not an island, " Yu said.

Little things

But at the same time, Niu Yang and Gu Min also mentioned that online intervention is effective.

At some point, the hotel escort's volunteer call to the residents of the quarantine zone became, by default, "family. ". Some of the residents who had left the hotel after the quarantine period would reply to them in the group, "you work so hard, I really feel at home here. "

In their first few days, they came across several cases of people in a broken state. Over the past 10 days, the group has become more relaxed and accepting of Wuhan's predicament. Some of them have even taken to defending volunteering and the hotel staff, and have privately added volunteers to Wechat to express their thanks.

Zhang Changjiang, a medical volunteer, even made a friend in the course of counseling, a former soldier.

As a doctor of cardiology of grade 2018 in the First Clinical College of Wuhan University, he had just finished a lecture on hypertension in the 2 Group of the Taoyuan Community Grid, and a group friend had applied for a friend. At the beginning of the conversation, Mr. Zhang (not his real name) was very angry, saying that he went to the hospital to have a lot of tests, spent a lot of money on medicine, but could not control his blood pressure well.

With many years of clinical experience, Zhang is very good at handling this kind of patients. After solving the problem of drug use, Mr. Zhang began to tell Zhang Changjiang the root cause of his recent bad state.

Affected by the epidemic, his company is now unable to resume work, wages are still issued, which itself has high blood pressure, he even more angry. "I told him that I am the same now. I couldn't go to work if I wanted to. My brother's company is the same as yours, and pays much more in a month than you. "

Under the guidance of Zhang, his mood gradually improved, and now every day in the group with residents, volunteering for interaction, and occasionally find Zhang Changjiang chat. "when he asked me if he could drink in his condition, I said yes, and he would drink two taels of red wine and one tael of white wine every day. He later joked that he could drink a lot of wine today, so could he drink half a catty of white wine? "

Like Zhang, many of the volunteers on the team can be called experts or elites, but they don't just act as helpers in their interactions with residents. In the stories of these volunteers, the assistance of professional knowledge is only a channel to get close to the residents, and finally can achieve the empathy between people, forming the spiritual support to the Wuhan people, occupying a larger part of the relief.

The "social worker Resonance" team's Douyin Account, "she rabbit, " will be in the form of a cartoon epidemic of Science

During my two-week observation of social worker resonance, I also glimpsed a new kind of community-resident relationship. In the past, the roles of the more loose administrators and the regulated were closely linked because of sudden crises, and the residents of Wuhan have depended on the governance of the community as never before, and Society has not really developed the so-called community of social life with a common culture and some kind of interactive relationship, even the national well-known Cultural Advanced Community Baibu Pavilion, nor has it demonstrated the kind of collaboration and execution that a highly autonomous community should have.

The entry of professional social workers seems to help solve this problem. In the 1880s, the Barnet couple, the founders of the university's neighbourhood movement, summed up the spirit at the heart of community improvement as people being able to share themselves with their neighbours and do small things to eliminate social inequality.

This view, in essence, is to improve social work to find a new way: Between self-help and social top-down management, individuals and groups with knowledge can enter the population, provide more specialized services to help the community improve. The serendipitous outbreak in Wuhan may be an opportunity for the cultural development of the local community and for the usefulness of social workers to be widely recognized in China.

Now, "social worker resonance" service has been from the North Lake Street, Yue Hotel in Jianghan District, expand to Hualou Water Tower Street community and Xinhua Road New BINKAI, Xinhua road all season, Changqing Road 7 days, Civil Aviation Shengjia rose four separate point hotel. Jiang Jiang of the core coordination group told me that at present there are still some street communities in Wuhan that are contacting them on their own initiative, hoping to promote this set of models.

Chen Yu, who helped "social worker resonance" land in Jianghan District, also helped to contact the newly built Shelter Hospital on the Wuhan Front Line. On February 6, the Hubei Provincial Civil Affairs Bureau contacted Yu Zhihong, hoping that the "social worker resonance" service could dock into the shelter. The next day, the volunteer team went to the Wembley Arena, where they first tried to serve 50 patients.

Social worker resonance has partnered with the Wembley Arena Wuchang Shelter Hospital and the Wuhan Living Room Shelter Hospital to serve more than 900 shelter patients online.

In the Hongshan District shelter, "social worker resonance" set up a two-day in-cabin mutual help mechanism, divided 122 cabin crew into five zones, and elected district leaders, led by the district leaders, cabin crew assistance, do some help patients clean up garbage, food distribution, maintain environmental hygiene, reflect the special needs of patients.

From Niu's circle of friends, I also saw the inside of the Shelter Hospital for the first time without the official words.

She shared screenshots of a chat in the east side shelter group, where several people were discussing a humorous doctor. He compared the designated hospital for the seriously ill to a key high school, and compared the patients in the shelter to students in a regular high school. "If you can't get into a key high school, just stay in a regular high school! "

When I ran this, I noticed that her last friend had posted a photo of a Red Tulip in a hotel window. I was very impressed by the potted flower. It was the first day that residents of the Yue hotel isolation point entered the hotel escort group, and a woman asked the group's first question.

"The flowers are in bloom for me this morning. Do you want some water? "

Companionship is the most valuable human care that social resonance can provide when a chaotic society is too busy to care for a specific person's voice. Even if you can't really meet your needs right away, an immediate response and reassurance is better than no response at all. "At least let him feel that he is not an island. "

By Jiang Jingyi

When society is faced with extreme situations, voluntary organizations formed spontaneously by citizens can be an important complement to the shutdown of the machine.

The mutual aid groups for medical travel, the angel team of masks and the information docking platform for medical supplies, which we have reported before, have formed a kind of hub or platform on the front line of the Wuhan Epidemic, the problem of part operation of the medical system under the chaotic state of the city was solved in time. Today, we want to talk about social workers and communities, and an online volunteer social work team called social worker resonance.

In this outbreak, community as the smallest form of social management has been fully mobilized. According to the 2012-2020 plan for the distribution of community sites in Wuhan Central City, 985 communities serve more than 11 million permanent residents, and the standard for serving population in central communities is 15,000-30,000 people.

Under the epidemic situation, facing such huge crowd and urgent meticulous management request, the introduction of professional social workers to assist in information screening and resource allocation under the overload condition of the original community workers, there is a hidden need for broader prevention and psychological intervention that was previously ignored.

In the mainland, the awareness of social workers is still largely confined to voluntary charitable services. However, in developed countries such as Europe and America, as well as in Hong Kong, social workers have completed the process of professionalization and specialization, and their participation in social services and development has formed an effective method to solve social problems.

We can understand "social worker resonance" as the intermediary between Wuhan residents and communities, hospitals, centralized isolation points, or buffer layer. Their intervention may not directly solve many of Wuhan's immediate problems, but not all of them can be solved in an immediate manner.

Yu Zhihong is the designer of social worker resonance. She was also a sociology professor at Wuhan University and a native of Wuhan.

With the closing of the Han corridor and the suspension of public transport in the city at 10 am on January 23, Wuhan was plunged into its most frantic moment since the outbreak. Before the arrival of the top-down support force, the strong sense of isolated island prompted a large number of voluntary groups spontaneously formed, self-help has become the most central topic of Wuhan People.

How to participate in this emergency rescue as a scholar is a question that Yu Zhihong has been thinking about for several days. The next day, she set up a university community docking group and gathered a group of social work teachers, hoping to put together a plan to support the work of frontline social workers in Wuhan.

In Yu's view, the form of the social hotline is no longer sufficient to support the current situation in Wuhan, "It's more like a band-aid. It works when the call comes in, but it's the next connection, and a lot of things have to be redone. And for the people of Wuhan, the most urgent need now is to solve the problem of survival, not just psychological comfort."

The establishment of a targeted and sustained service system, linking social workers, psychological and medical volunteers, and relying on specific communities to sink into the residents, is Yu Zhihong's view that the more appropriate mode of operation at present. "And it has to be done online. The value of a social worker is not in rushing to the front line to deliver food, but in being able to serve more people in a short period of time. "

The program is what she calls the "2 + 3" model of online community sink versus epidemic. "2" refers to local community workers and online volunteer social workers, and "3" refers to online medical volunteers, psychological volunteers and social worker assistants. The team of volunteers, led by social workers, will be assigned to a three-tier defense model, ranging from healthy community residents to fever isolators to confirmed patients and suspected cases, to provide the corresponding help service for the different demand crowd.

Yu Zhihong is the designer of social worker resonance. She was also a sociology professor at Wuhan University and a native of Wuhan.

With the closing of the Han corridor and the suspension of public transport in the city at 10 am on January 23, Wuhan was plunged into its most frantic moment since the outbreak. Before the arrival of the top-down support force, the strong sense of isolated island prompted a large number of voluntary groups spontaneously formed, self-help has become the most central topic of Wuhan People.

How to participate in this emergency rescue as a scholar is a question that Yu Zhihong has been thinking about for several days. The next day, she set up a university community docking group and gathered a group of social work teachers, hoping to put together a plan to support the work of frontline social workers in Wuhan.

In Yu's view, the form of the social hotline is no longer sufficient to support the current situation in Wuhan, "It's more like a band-aid. It works when the call comes in, but it's the next connection, and a lot of things have to be redone. And for the people of Wuhan, the most urgent need now is to solve the problem of survival, not just psychological comfort."

The "2 + 3" model of community submersion and epidemic prevention designed by Yuzhihong

The Model sinks down to the large number of volunteers needed by the community, on the one hand from the Wuhan University's student resources. Jiang Jiang and Hu Yue, who helped Ms. Yu form her team in the first place, are her former students, and the core coordination team is largely made up of her social work students, most of whom were initially recruited from Wuhan University's previous medical students.

On the other hand, Yu's network of universities and academic organizations around the world. In addition to passion, professionalism and practical experience are the "social worker resonance" recruitment volunteers especially social workers and psychological volunteers hard target.

Heilongjiang's Longjiang social worker is so far the only team to join the "social worker resonance" , including psychological, social workers, medical treatment, a total of more than 30 volunteers. According to Niu Yang, a volunteer social worker, Yu connected with Huang Hong, director of the Institute of Sociology at the Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, to access social work resources in Heilongjiang.

The volunteers who participated in the rescue in Wuhan had to pass the strict qualification examination of the Longjiang Supervision Group of social workers. The selected social workers basically had intermediate social worker certificates and had many years of teaching or practical experience.

Niu Yang himself was one of the first 4105 social workers to pass the professional examination in 2008. She was involved in the 2018 Harbin 825 major fire accident social workers volunteer relief work, in her impression, this is the Heilongjiang post-disaster social work opportunity, is also her more than 10 years of experience in social work, a turning point for the real and rapid improvement of the practical ability.

Gu Min, the head of the group, is from Shanghai. She has worked as an EAP (enterprise employee psychological assistance) for more than 10 years in a 200-strong state-owned enterprise. At weekends, she works as a psychological consultant in a psychological counseling organization designated by the Shanghai Education Bureau. She saw the "social worker resonance" message among the students in mid-durban.

"I was joking with my teacher that the Wuhan community was very good and I came to Zhongdurban to recruit people, " he said, referring to one of the earliest professional training programs in the field of psychological counseling in China, gu Min is part of a continuous training program in psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy in China and Germany. The program is open to students from all over the country. In the end, less than 200 students were approved.

The first large-scale psychological intervention in the country for people affected by the disaster began with the 2008 Wenchuan County earthquake. But in that year's post-disaster rescue, a "fire and theft prevention psychological consultant" proverb is widely spread, which refers to the time by the unprofessional, unorganized psychological rescue brought secondary harm.

In response to the Wuhan Epidemic this time, Gu Min introduced to me the online rescue plan of the psychological volunteer group, the ethical protection principle of consulting by joining an assistant with the consent of the person seeking help, the arrangement of consulting records in real time, the introduction of the supervision of a psychological consultant with experience in crisis intervention, the daily seminar and other measures, at least architecturally, there is a certain amount of patterniness.

In the face of major disasters, when all eyes are on the overall situation and order, many tragedies often occur in the neglect of the individual. In a complete disaster response mechanism, the rescue of social emotions needs to be initiated simultaneously.

Go to the community

Based on the mobilization of local universities and professional organizations, there are now more than 400 volunteers in the "social worker Resonance" reserve all over the country. How to transport this large number of civilian volunteers to the Wuhan Community, is the next problem of Yu Zhihong.

The "2 + 3" plan actually spread quickly among social workers. Yu Zhihong told me that she was contacted by the Hubei Social Workers Union on January 30, the day the article was published, in a post on the public account, and that the model has now been incorporated into the social workers intervention guide by the Wuhan Social Workers Union.

But to get down to the concrete streets and neighborhoods, professional recognition isn't enough to get her to act quickly. I wonder how she can win the trust and cooperation of the district government. After all, social work is still a new thing in the mainland, and the pace of professionalization is still far behind.

In the past, opportunities and space for social workers to work with the community were also limited. It was usually when the Home Affairs Bureau (Hab) purchased services from social work agencies that social workers would be connected to the communities and streets concerned to provide services. And this outbreak is an unprecedented challenge for all segments of society.

Yu's teaching experience at the Wuhan University has helped her accumulate resources from well established local social work organizations. The scheme was launched on 29 January at the Chak Pei Social Work Service Centre to serve Pak Sha Chau in Wuchang District and Taipei road in Jiang'an District. It was founded in 2014 in Wuhan as a non-profit NGO and an internship unit she had previously contacted for social work students.

After two days to help ze Pei up and running, Yu Zhihong immediately moved to the Kong Hon district to establish their own "social worker resonance" team. Kong Hon is one of the hardest hit areas in Wuhan. As an old city, the population density is high, the degree of aging is more serious, the residents'ability to obtain information and protect themselves is relatively weak, and the pressure of community work is accordingly increased.

Through her friend Chen Yu, who has been in charge of the youth space in Jianghan District for years, Yu quickly contacted the person in charge of Beihu Street. It went better than she thought.

"This outbreak came so suddenly that everyone continued to operate in the usual pattern. Many streets will hesitate to open their doors. After all, we are folk volunteers. When you're running for your life, it's very unlikely that the government or the community will ever think about it."

But "social worker resonance" must fall back into the community. In the current urban control program in Wuhan, the screening of fever patients, the arrangement of free transportation, the life service of centralized isolation personnel and so on need to contact the community. Community is the shortest way and the only way for Wuhan residents to get medical treatment and life help.

In particular, following the announcement by the Epidemic Command on February 2 that centralized treatment and isolation of "four categories of people" must be completed, and the announcement on February 11 that all residential areas throughout the city will be under closed management, community and temporary centralized quarantine site staff have in fact become one of the most stressful groups to work outside of medical staff.

Based on the mobilization of local universities and professional organizations, there are now more than 400 volunteers in the "social worker Resonance" reserve all over the country. How to transport this large number of civilian volunteers to the Wuhan Community, is the next problem of Yu Zhihong.

"The community is our most basic social organization, and if the community is disorganized, our whole society will be greatly impacted. The needs of many residents are very practical, and if you leave the community, your work will not go on. "

In the previous scenario, the volunteers would go directly to the original community grid and connect all the residents in the cluster, but this non-hierarchical, non-screening approach relies heavily on the volunteer's personal enthusiasm, and the activity of the cluster is often not very high.

"It would be valuable to be able to sink to all the grid clusters, because you would be able to reach the majority of the population. But this approach requires tapping into a large number of wechat groups, making it difficult to select residents who are motivated to participate in the interaction. At present, we do not have enough human resources, so it is easy to cause human waste."

So in collaboration with Kong Hon, social worker resonance has created several targeted group chats in addition to its presence on the grid, including Popular Science, parent-child, elderly consultation, home care, Hotel Care, hotel staff support, through the grid group to recruit residents in need into the group.

On February 1, six new wechat groups called "social worker resonance" were launched.

The first call for help came at 10:56 p.m. in the Home Care Group.

"Good evening, brothers and sisters! My family has had a fever since the 22nd and it has been running high for more than 10 days. This afternoon I can hardly speak, I can not walk, I can hardly breathe. Please, I have no resources to help. "

The caller, Tian Ting (not her real name) , was not in Wuhan. Her brother, who was in critical condition that day, was called 120 and sent to Wuhan's Fifth Hospital for treatment, but could not be admitted because he had not yet received the quota for nucleic acid tests, she's been calling community and lung hospitals all day.

At the same time, another caller, Ms. Yin (not her real name) , also sent out a long message in the group. Doctors diagnosed her 77 year old mother with COVID-19 pneumonia, but the community hospital and the East West Lake People's Hospital could not immediately arrange for confirmation and admission.

She now takes care of the children at her home in east West Lake, while her husband takes care of her mother and her mentally challenged sister in Hanyang. She hopes to use social worker resonance to secure hospital beds.

The two messages in the group are clear and consistent in their need to get their loved ones out of isolation at home and into the hospital for treatment. But in the "2 + 3" three-level defense model, home escort group belongs to the second-level Defense, specifically for the home isolation of the fever crowd to provide guidance, advice, comfort, not directly into the hospital. The community is a dead end.

According to the classification of fever residents in Wuhan, which has been fully implemented since January 24, cases of fever still need to be reported through community hospitals, despite the announcement by the headquarters that designated fever clinics can not refuse patients for any reason, the transport of patients to designated hospitals is also centrally arranged by the districts.

When Tian Ting and Yin asked for help, Chen Yu, a social worker, was the first to respond. After asking about their specific neighborhood and community, Liu Yang, a psychologist, immediately followed up and posted, "I see your frustration and frustration. If I were you, I'd be crazy. You're doing great. You're strong. You're rational. "

Another social worker, Joyce Giann Wong, began guiding Tian to provide more detailed and accurate information. After she uploaded the patient's blood work report and CT images, Li Yiyi, a medical volunteer, followed up and made a preliminary assessment, reassuring Tian that her brother's blood test did not necessarily show new pneumonia.

Li Yi appeared in the group, Ms. Yin immediately sent her mother's CT image and her own identity card to the group, and Directly@her, implore "Dr. Li" to help diagnose.

After midnight, Yu began using his resources to contact the hospital, while the social worker in the group continued to ask Ms. Yin one specific and simple question after another, how she's doing tonight, whether she's sleeping, whether you're with her, whether you have oxygen in the house, gradually shifting the narrative from Catharsis to debriefing.

The group's communication lasted until nearly 1 a.m. The next morning, Ms. Yin's mother was in critical condition. She and her husband again called for help in the group. The mood that had eased the night before became heated again. Ms Yin's mother was not admitted to Hanyang Hospital, which had been trying to contact her all night, but was unable to reach her, "If it would save my mother's life, I would die at once! "

Yu Zhihong has foreseen the inevitable occurrence of this situation, and also knows that "social worker resonance" Can not actually meet the needs of hospital beds for help seekers at present, the home escort group can play a more role in preventive emotional intervention.

"One steps into the abyss. The part of them that gets mad is in a state of utter despair. If we don't want to accumulate this social emotion, we have to intervene before she gets to this point, we have to respond to her, we have to help her, we have to give her information, and with that information she feels confident."

The recent "social worker Resonance" team is doing an expert course on grief counseling

Finally, with the help of "social worker resonance, " Ms. Yin's mother was placed on a priority follow-up list in the corresponding community. As it turned out, the help seemed to be only slightly better than it had been, and the underlying problem was not immediately solved.

Niu Yang, a social worker volunteer, had a hard time believing that such a purely online social worker intervention would actually help residents. The hotel escort she was assigned to was also a secondary defense, facing dozens of residents concentrated in isolation at the Yue Hotel.

Cases like Ms. Yin's don't happen every day. More often than not, Niu Yang has to deal with daily needs like no toilet paper in the room, bad taste in food, and helping to collect things. But this kind of question still needs the hotel to separate the spot staff to solve finally, "what we play is a buffer function. "

On Feb. 4, a mother-in-law in her 60s who was quarantined at the Yue hotel called for help. Her husband had been diagnosed with new pneumonia and had spent many days at the intensive-care unit, but she had just received a phone call from him saying his room had been moved downstairs, it's like the hospital's trying to get rid of him.

The day before, when the hospital issued the death notice, the community workers had already taken the risk of consuming five sets of protective clothing to accompany the old woman to visit her husband. Now the mother-in-law wants to go to the hospital again, perhaps to see her husband for the last time.

In the end, this requirement can not be met with multiple communications. Niu and his colleagues wondered if they could contact a doctor at a Red Cross hospital to shoot a video of their mother-in-law's wife.

When he signed up to participate in the "Social Worker Resonance" program, Niu did not expect that the actual situation in Wuhan would be so serious, "In the face of many problems that should be solvable in normal times, in special circumstances it is really unable to solve. " Inevitably, she developed a strong sense of empathy and powerlessness.

Even though most of the volunteers have substantial practical experience and a strong theoretical background, "when we get involved, we learn so much that outsiders can't see through their conversations and circles of friends. "

Gu Min, a volunteer who was also involved in the case, said she and other counselors had envisioned online counseling using a variety of psychological tools in their preparation, for example, to adjust the cognitive, stimulate their own enthusiasm, short exchange of exceptional questions, but "really is the face of the service object, we do more or listening, empathy and companionship. "
Companionship is the most valuable human care that "social resonance" can provide when a chaotic society is too busy to care for a specific person's voice. Even if you can't really meet the demand immediately, immediate response and comfort is always better than no one cares.

"At least let him feel that he is not an island, " Yu said.

But at the same time, Niu Yang and Gu Min also mentioned that online intervention is effective.

At some point, the hotel escort's volunteer call to the residents of the quarantine zone became, by default, "family. ". Some of the residents who had left the hotel after the quarantine period would reply to them in the group, "you work so hard, I really feel at home here. "

In their first few days, they came across several cases of people in a broken state. Over the past 10 days, the group has become more relaxed and accepting of Wuhan's predicament. Some of them have even taken to defending volunteering and the hotel staff, and have privately added volunteers to Wechat to express their thanks.

Zhang Changjiang, a medical volunteer, even made a friend in the course of counseling, a former soldier.

As a doctor of cardiology of grade 2018 in the First Clinical College of Wuhan University, he had just finished a lecture on hypertension in the 2 Group of the Taoyuan Community Grid, and a group friend had applied for a friend. At the beginning of the conversation, Mr. Zhang (not his real name) was very angry, saying that he went to the hospital to have a lot of tests, spent a lot of money on medicine, but could not control his blood pressure well.

With many years of clinical experience, Zhang is very good at handling this kind of patients. After solving the problem of drug use, Mr. Zhang began to tell Zhang Changjiang the root cause of his recent bad state.

Affected by the epidemic, his company is now unable to resume work, wages are still issued, which itself has high blood pressure, he even more angry. "I told him that I am the same now. I couldn't go to work if I wanted to. My brother's company is the same as yours, and pays much more in a month than you. "

Under the guidance of Zhang, his mood gradually improved, and now every day in the group with residents, volunteering for interaction, and occasionally find Zhang Changjiang chat. "when he asked me if he could drink in his condition, I said yes, and he would drink two taels of red wine and one tael of white wine every day. He later joked that he could drink a lot of wine today, so could he drink half a catty of white wine? "

Like Zhang, many of the volunteers on the team can be called experts or elites, but they don't just act as helpers in their interactions with residents. In the stories of these volunteers, the assistance of professional knowledge is only a channel to get close to the residents, and finally can achieve the empathy between people, forming the spiritual support to the Wuhan people, occupying a larger part of the relief.

But at the same time, Niu Yang and Gu Min also mentioned that online intervention is effective.

At some point, the hotel escort's volunteer call to the residents of the quarantine zone became, by default, "family. ". Some of the residents who had left the hotel after the quarantine period would reply to them in the group, "you work so hard, I really feel at home here. "

In their first few days, they came across several cases of people in a broken state. Over the past 10 days, the group has become more relaxed and accepting of Wuhan's predicament. Some of them have even taken to defending volunteering and the hotel staff, and have privately added volunteers to Wechat to express their thanks.

Zhang Changjiang, a medical volunteer, even made a friend in the course of counseling, a former soldier.

As a doctor of cardiology of grade 2018 in the First Clinical College of Wuhan University, he had just finished a lecture on hypertension in the 2 Group of the Taoyuan Community Grid, and a group friend had applied for a friend. At the beginning of the conversation, Mr. Zhang (not his real name) was very angry, saying that he went to the hospital to have a lot of tests, spent a lot of money on medicine, but could not control his blood pressure well.

With many years of clinical experience, Zhang is very good at handling this kind of patients. After solving the problem of drug use, Mr. Zhang began to tell Zhang Changjiang the root cause of his recent bad state.

Affected by the epidemic, his company is now unable to resume work, wages are still issued, which itself has high blood pressure, he even more angry. "I told him that I am the same now. I couldn't go to work if I wanted to. My brother's company is the same as yours, and pays much more in a month than you. "

Under the guidance of Zhang, his mood gradually improved, and now every day in the group with residents, volunteering for interaction, and occasionally find Zhang Changjiang chat. "when he asked me if he could drink in his condition, I said yes, and he would drink two taels of red wine and one tael of white wine every day. He later joked that he could drink a lot of wine today, so could he drink half a catty of white wine? "

The "social worker Resonance" team's Douyin Account, "she rabbit, " will be in the form of a cartoon epidemic of Science

During my two-week observation of social worker resonance, I also glimpsed a new kind of community-resident relationship. In the past, the roles of the more loose administrators and the regulated were closely linked because of sudden crises, and the residents of Wuhan have depended on the governance of the community as never before, and Society has not really developed the so-called community of social life with a common culture and some kind of interactive relationship, even the national well-known Cultural Advanced Community Baibu Pavilion, nor has it demonstrated the kind of collaboration and execution that a highly autonomous community should have.

The entry of professional social workers seems to help solve this problem. In the 1880s, the Barnet couple, the founders of the university's neighbourhood movement, summed up the spirit at the heart of community improvement as people being able to share themselves with their neighbours and do small things to eliminate social inequality.

This view, in essence, is to improve social work to find a new way: Between self-help and social top-down management, individuals and groups with knowledge can enter the population, provide more specialized services to help the community improve. The serendipitous outbreak in Wuhan may be an opportunity for the cultural development of the local community and for the usefulness of social workers to be widely recognized in China.

Now, "social worker resonance" service has been from the North Lake Street, Yue Hotel in Jianghan District, expand to Hualou Water Tower Street community and Xinhua Road New BINKAI, Xinhua road all season, Changqing Road 7 days, Civil Aviation Shengjia rose four separate point hotel. Jiang Jiang of the core coordination group told me that at present there are still some street communities in Wuhan that are contacting them on their own initiative, hoping to promote this set of models.

Chen Yu, who helped "social worker resonance" land in Jianghan District, also helped to contact the newly built Shelter Hospital on the Wuhan Front Line. On February 6, the Hubei Provincial Civil Affairs Bureau contacted Yu Zhihong, hoping that the "social worker resonance" service could dock into the shelter. The next day, the volunteer team went to the Wembley Arena, where they first tried to serve 50 patients.

Social worker resonance has partnered with the Wembley Arena Wuchang Shelter Hospital and the Wuhan Living Room Shelter Hospital to serve more than 900 shelter patients online.

In the Hongshan District shelter, "social worker resonance" set up a two-day in-cabin mutual help mechanism, divided 122 cabin crew into five zones, and elected district leaders, led by the district leaders, cabin crew assistance, do some help patients clean up garbage, food distribution, maintain environmental hygiene, reflect the special needs of patients.

From Niu's circle of friends, I also saw the inside of the Shelter Hospital for the first time without the official words.

She shared screenshots of a chat in the east side shelter group, where several people were discussing a humorous doctor. He compared the designated hospital for the seriously ill to a key high school, and compared the patients in the shelter to students in a regular high school. "If you can't get into a key high school, just stay in a regular high school! "

When I ran this, I noticed that her last friend had posted a photo of a Red Tulip in a hotel window. I was very impressed by the potted flower. It was the first day that residents of the Yue hotel isolation point entered the hotel escort group, and a woman asked the group's first question.

"The flowers are in bloom for me this morning. Do you want some water? "
