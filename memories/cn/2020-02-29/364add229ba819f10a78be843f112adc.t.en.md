2020.2.29

The last day of February, according to the official notice date, Hubei Province to adhere to 10 days, originally thought only 28 days, for no reason and "gift" a day. During this period of time, I gradually lost the concept of time and price, and I didn't have the concept of time before the holidays. I just remember how many days before work / school started, and I always felt that the holidays went by so quickly that I had to go back to work before I could enjoy my leisure time. Now it's the other way around, counting down the days until it's unsealed, hoping that time will pass faster. I do not want to disturb the normal biological clock, still according to the work schedule, up more than 6 a.m. , more than 10 p.m. Sleep, the whole day is extremely long, the phone screen looked long eyes are dry and painful, can only look at the phone for an hour, get up, roll around, rest your eyes.

More and more residents in the community volunteer, at home doing nothing, idle is also idle, women are mainly responsible for statistical information and billing, men are doing their part, drive to the supermarket to pick up goods, then back sorting. Everyone has a clear division of Labor. The package is arranged according to the building and the unit. When it comes to the entrance of each unit, the number of the house is written on the plastic bag. Residents can get their own things just by going downstairs, reducing the gathering and unnecessary contact. These days there is rain, it's not sanitary to leave it out in the open. Some residents reported that the contents of the package were different. They bought fresh seafood, brought a large bag of Wu River pickled mustard and bean paste, and were about to have another argument in the group. Finally, the property owner called the Zhongbai Supermarket and asked the residents to deliver the package intact to the property office, they contacted the supermarket for a refund.

My crafty friend made plain toast at home, but it didn't work, the bread didn't ferment well, it was well organized, and my friend got the idea to treat the heavy bread like a big steamed bun, slice it and fry it in a pan, add ham and eggs, and squeeze it with Mayonnaise, it doesn't look like it was ever a failure. She finally grabbed wide rice noodles in the box, very excited, one to do hot dry wide powder, one to do with soup beef powder, and hit an Eggnog, is a classic Wuhan early (breakfast) .

If you ask me what I miss most about Wuhan, it's that I want to eat rice Baba. Rice milk with Rice wine fermentation, fluffy sweet, home near the door of the vegetable market sell Kang Rice Baba, 2 yuan a, a very large, small plastic bags can not fit, but also fold. Rice cake is sold now, very fresh, I often Hoida to buy a few, but also early in the morning, to the noon of the good rice milk, the shop owner will sell lo-mei. Later, when the area was demolished, the vegetable market and the small shops around it were closed en masse, and the small shop selling Rice Baba was never seen again. One time, having Hubei food with a friend, she recommended me to order a wine-made cake. I thought it was an upgraded Rice Baba. In fact, it was a traditional pie with rice wine wrapped in it, well, that's disappointing.

On Weibo, I saw a cute video of a Guangxi medical team recording "pretty girl soldiers" dressed from head to toe in a shelter in Wuchang. I also thought of the Xinjiang medical team that had previously taught patients to dance in the shelter, we can always find happiness in the bad days. The condition of the shelter hospital is not bad, the three meals are rich in nutrition, there are book corners to borrow books, occasionally dancing and doing exercises with doctors and nurses, nearby patients can also chat and make friends, see some short videos, the patients in the shelter arranged their own programs to perform skits, the only thing I can't stand is 24-hour lights-out, and many mentally weak insomniacs may be losing sleep.

I pay attention to a public number recommended Baduanjin, suitable for the spring exercise, open mind, soothing liver relieve depression, breathing spring vitality. On Site B, I found a video of myself doing it, and I ended up feeling a little warm and comfortable as I unzipped. In addition to the eight tips, I found a third set of videos called the Radio calisthenics, for the first time, being a Radio calisthenics was a pleasure. My friend commented, "another crazy day. " .

In the past, I took an elective course of "Health Qigong" in physical education, and for two years, I first learned beginner's level, then followed the same teacher to learn advanced level. What the beginner's class taught was Baduanjin. I studied for a whole semester, and the teacher was very careful in every movement, it's not like I thought I could just waltz through it. The reason for taking Qigong is very funny, the original selection of table tennis, really overestimate themselves, to the ball game has no talent, can not catch a ball, also racquet over the net, the teacher suggested that I quit class as soon as possible, otherwise failing the final exam will affect the GPA. It was the end of the course selection, the remaining can choose is not what "good course" , either difficult, fail the test, or the teacher strict, do not row. Health Qigong belongs to the latter, teachers are very serious, pre-class roll call, after-class sign-in, fortunately, small amount of exercise, warm-up without running, every time in the woods do leisurely boxing exercise, summer is also enjoy.

After the epidemic, I decided to get a tattoo, I haven't decided the location yet, maybe the arm, but also the back of the neck and the back of the neck, some friends who have done tattoos told me that the inside of the wrist and the ankle are very painful, it's better to do it in a place with rough skin and thick flesh, there is a tattoo of two arms of the girl, said the original done tattoos, pain for more than a month did not dare to take a bath, and molting the layer of skin like.

Decided to get a tattoo, said it was to "keep as a souvenir" is not appropriate, I hope I do not forget. Perhaps 10-and-a-half years later, we will slowly forget the pain of pneumonia, some of the things that happened to remember inaccuracy, bias, as the center of the storm, I am also afraid that one day "do not remember" , "do not remember" , although the network diary has the backup, perhaps one day "is disappeared and 404" , might as well engrave on the skin reminds oneself.

After listening to a podcast, the host read a book in Wuhan for four years. During his isolation, he talked about his views on Wuhan and its people. There are many colleges and universities in Wuhan, but it is a pity that talents from outside Hubei Province can not be retained, he said that many of those who stayed in Wuhan were local aborigines and people from within the province, so it was always "the inner circle of Hubei. " The new ones could not come in and the old ones were hard to get rid of. But Wuhan also has advantages that other cities can not match. Its culture is inclusive and open. "punk city" and "very hard core" are roughly the same meaning. On the contrary, official propaganda is not as popular as ordinary people / Interest groups. Wuhan is also very close to the people, suitable for ordinary people's life, frankly speaking, is "diaosi friendly" , middle-and low-income people's sense of happiness is higher than the first-class or the same level cities, Diaosi can also live more comfortable, prices and wages are not too much different, nor is there a clear rejection or discrimination of outsiders by locals. He cited three meals as an example, "such as early, monthly income of 5,000 eat hot dry noodles, monthly income of 10,000 also eat hot dry noodles, the difference may be that one eat ordinary noodles, only radish beans, another eat beef hot dry noodles, plus a tiger skin eggs. ".

When my eyes hurt, I listen to the lectures. These days, I concentrate on Qin Hui's lectures, and I have learned a lot. My latest lecture, the history of responsibility to oneself, deserves to be praised at the end, qin said that "contingency is an excuse for stupidity and incompetence. " History does not have inevitability. All claims that "XX is bound to come true / success / Victory" are assumptions and illusions that have no practical guiding significance, all predictions and plans that span decades can be seen as hoaxes, and no one can really predict how the future will unfold. But the uncertainty of history is precisely the value of everyone's efforts. If history really does not shift by individual will, no one has to struggle, sleep at home and wait for a bright or dark tomorrow. The future of happiness is created by people, no, God gave it to me.

Recommended "beautiful price: The rules of the modeling industry, " the only paper book I brought back, I now regret, not a lot of books in the suitcase, all left in Xi'an, so has been "reluctant" to read. Mills, the author of beautiful prices, a young part time model who left the modeling industry to pursue a phd at Nyu, is based on more than two years of mills'hands on research and fieldwork. Models are not necessarily high-income class, do not represent the "upper class" , but they are the link between consumers and luxury, beauty, desire. "Beauty" is actually a paradox in the modeling industry. When viewed by talent scouts, most of the models trained by the company with heavy salaries meet the standard of "fair skin, blonde hair, regular teeth and deep facial features. " But more and more companies are looking for new people with a more personal look, rejecting the assembly-line aesthetic. Mills details the conflicts and gaps between male and female models in the modeling industry, the struggles of agents, client companies, photographers, and stylists, and the alienation of the modeling industry from the public's aesthetic and consumer preferences, "The look of a model is a visual representation of social inequality. ".

"The young girl who grew up in a harmonious family, with her misty, tearful charm, is a dream indeed, but it does not attract my love. It all comes down to being an alien to me. I like this kind of girl, she was separated from her family, grew up in an unfortunate environment, but do not want to admit their own misfortune, and overcome this misfortune, walked. This victory was followed by an immense descent before her. She has a strong personality and doesn't know fear. This kind of girl has a kind of danger, I was attracted to her, let this kind of girl restore pure heart, their heart will also become pure, this seems to be my love, i particularly liked the passage from Yasunari Kawabata's letter to his parents, describing his first love for his fiancee, who was looking forward to the wedding with great joy. The first generation wrote, "something extraordinary has happened, " asking him to forget himself.

Yasunari Kawabata was so moved by a unilateral breach of contract / betrayal of unknown origin that there is a phrase in going to the fire that I like, "she" pulls away from the crowd and walks down the hill alone, rather Walk Straight into the fire than turn in the direction of my home:

"Her shadow, a dark spot, leapt into my field of vision in a sea of fire, and I felt a pain like a needle piercing my eyes. I woke up from my dream. Tears were running from the corners of my eyes.

I knew she'd say she didn't want to go in my direction. She can think what she wants. But for my part, under the lash of reason, my feelings for her had completely cooled, and I was dead on the surface, but in fact I was still unrequited: In some corner of her affections there was a drop of affection for me. Of course, this has nothing to do with the real her. I have laughed at myself mercilessly, yet secretly I wish I were still there."

When he wrote about the first generation, he really liked to use "fire" : I embraced the Red Campfire and gazed at Michiko's face, flickering in the light of the flames. It must have been the most beautiful moment of her life.

This victory was followed by an immense descent before her. She has a strong personality and doesn't know fear. This kind of girl has a kind of danger, I was attracted to her, let this kind of girl restore pure heart, their heart will also become pure, this seems to be my love, i particularly liked the passage from Yasunari Kawabata's letter to his parents, describing his first love for his fiancee, who was looking forward to the wedding with great joy. The first generation wrote, "something extraordinary has happened, " asking him to forget himself.

Yasunari Kawabata was so moved by a unilateral breach of contract / betrayal of unknown origin that there is a phrase in going to the fire that I like, "she" pulls away from the crowd and walks down the hill alone, rather Walk Straight into the fire than turn in the direction of my home:

"Her shadow, a dark spot, leapt into my field of vision in a sea of fire, and I felt a pain like a needle piercing my eyes. I woke up from my dream. Tears were running from the corners of my eyes.

I knew she'd say she didn't want to go in my direction. She can think what she wants. But for my part, under the lash of reason, my feelings for her had completely cooled, and I was dead on the surface, but in fact I was still unrequited: In some corner of her affections there was a drop of affection for me. Of course, this has nothing to do with the real her. I have laughed at myself mercilessly, yet secretly I wish I were still there."

When he wrote about the first generation, he really liked to use "fire" : I embraced the Red Campfire and gazed at Michiko's face, flickering in the light of the flames. It must have been the most beautiful moment of her life.
