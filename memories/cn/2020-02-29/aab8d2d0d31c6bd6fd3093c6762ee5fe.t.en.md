The function introduces, records the person and the disease, the senility, the death coexistence way.

He fell ill in a Wuhan prison, and was diagnosed after he arrived in Beijing from Wuhan after being released from prison. Huang Dengying, 61, caused a public opinion shock recently. On February 26, the central joint investigation team went to Hubei, to conduct an investigation into the incident of "persons released from Wuhan Women's prison with new pneumonia coming to Beijing" .

"Huang Dengying and my wife are in the same cell block, the Second Cell Block of Section 11 of Wuhan Women's prison. "I am happy to be alive, " Zhao said to "occasionally cured" of his worries about his wife.

On February 24th, the notice from the village was that the husband was healthy. On February 26, the Department of Justice informed me that my husband had been diagnosed. " Zhao Rui, the wife of a prisoner at Rencheng District prison in Shandong Province, told the "occasional cure" . She and many of the prisoners, since the outbreak, has been hoping to receive reports of safe calls from family members, to know the treatment of confirmed family members, their demands have repeatedly hit a brick wall.

With the February 21 disclosure of the news, prison officers and the prison population was suddenly pushed into the hot search, mixed with emotions of public opinion wave came, there was silence behind bars.

According to reports, as of the 23rd, Wuhan Women's prison confirmed the largest number of 279 cases, Jining Rencheng District prison confirmed 207 cases. Since then, according to the outbreak reporting requirements, the prison epidemic into Wuhan and other places statistics, is no longer listed separately. As of 25 February, a total of 555 cases, 19 suspected cases and 4 critical cases had been confirmed in five prisons in three provinces.

According to media reports on the 21st, the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission formed an investigation team to investigate the situation of Rencheng District prison new coronavirus pneumonia in Shandong. It was also reported that 11 persons had been removed from their posts in the prison system, one had been given a serious warning by the Party and one had been placed under investigation.

In the same period, the number of newly confirmed cases in the country has exceeded 20. Why did the number of cases in high-security prisons rise as the country's epidemic improved?

"The Wuhan Women's prison is less than 100 meters away from the Wuhan Lung Hospital. The prison officers commute to work at the same bus stop as the hospital staff. The virus may have been introduced before the prison was fully closed. The outbreaks in Hanjin prison in Hubei, Shilifeng prison in Zhejiang and Rencheng District prison in Shandong were all caused by the inputting of imported cases due to the incompletion of isolation and misreporting by individual police officers after contacting the personnel in the Hubei Epidemic area. "Xiong Xianguo, Vice Minister of Justice, said at a State Council press conference on February 26.

Some prisoners'families expressed the hope that the prison would give the convicted prisoners the compassionate release and other opportunities. Some prison staff members'families lamented that the prison staff were overworked and that the date of ending the closure of the prison had been repeatedly postponed, and they would not see their families for 50 to 60 days.

"Occasional Cure" has contacted more than 20 prison officers, prison doctors, relatives of inmates and prison guards to try to restore the human feelings behind the incident.

The last "state of war" was SARS

This Spring Festival, for Liu Xiawei, a native of Jingzhou, Hubei Province, has been particularly difficult. The blows have come one after another, with children dying early, husbands in prison and New Year's dinners becoming lifeless.

It was the seventh year of Liu Xiawei's marriage. On January 8, her husband was taken from the Shashi District detention centre to prison, where he was sentenced to 13 years. It was only 13 days after her husband's imprisonment that Liu Xiawei learned he was in Hanjin prison. First three months are a training camp, no visits.

Also that day, in Wuhan, Hao Fenglou's 29-year-old daughter was transferred from Xiaogan Detention Center to Wuhan Women's prison. They went to prison together. 12 colleagues, all for wire fraud. On the 14th of January, a man came to see his daughter, and my daughter sent me a complaint, saying that she had no money, and was not allowed to take money with her when she was in prison. "said Hau fung-lau and"occasional cure".

Wuhan Women's prison, built in 1917 during the Beiyang government period, retains the old-style building, is one of China's oldest prison construction.

"It was only through communication between the families of the inmates that we learned that the local detention centre had not informed us when their families were taken away. My mother left the first detention center in yellowstone on January 20, without any notice, and for a while I didn't know where she was. " Henan Girl Qiao Youye told "occasional cure" that she had made twenty phone calls asking her mother to go to Wuhan Women's prison.

There are only three channels of communication between prisoners and their families: prison visits, telephone calls and Letters. Like many prisons, Rencheng District prison visits every Wednesday and once a month. The call is five minutes twice a month.

I'm married to him as a matter of fact, but we haven't been able to get a license yet. According to Article 48 of the Prisons Act, only relatives and guardians can exercise the right to visit him in prison, so I can not visit him in prison. Zhao said she had not seen her father for 13 months after her husband was taken from a detention center to Rencheng District prison. Foreign objects are not allowed in the prison. Zhao Rui sent a book to her husband and was refused a visa.

The only good news is, "maybe it's the new year. Last month he was allowed to make one more phone call. "

The call was made on January 25, the first day of the Lunar New Year, "he stood in line for half an hour and told me five minutes. ". This time, the husband did not mention "all right" to Zhao Rui, which was a hit show he was following in prison, but the tone was a little more worried, he said of the epidemic, let his wife take the baby do not go out, buy what let his sister sent.

"He used to say it was hard for me to take the baby alone and not have to mop the floor very often, but this time he said it was very important to mop the floor often and use sterile water. " Zhao said she did not expect to remind her husband to do protection, because she thought the prison is "the safest place.

The shadow of the epidemic is looming, and Wuhan is still welcoming the New Year.

On January 14, Wuhan Women's prison organized a "family visit" event; on January 17, it held a CCTV New Year's Gala for civilian police workers, attended by representatives of some retired civilian police officers and their families; and on January 18, the Baibu Pavilion Community hosted a family dinner for more than 40,000 families On January 20, the Hubei Provincial Bureau of Prison Administration held a New Year's Party with 14 female police officers from Wuhan Women's prison participating in the show. The alarm that did not pull, let gather sexual activity to carry on as usual, hidden danger is buried from this.

On January 20, the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Culture and tourism distributed 200,000 tickets for scenic spots to encourage citizens to go out and have fun. On that day, 33,058 citizens made successful bookings. On the same day, Academician Zhong Nanshan confirmed that the new coronavirus "human to human" .

On January 15, Hao Fenglou came to Wuhan from Xiaogan, but he was a day late. The prison only allowed him to visit the prison on Tuesdays. He sent 1,000 yuan to the police. On January 21, he finally met his daughter and gave her another 2,000 yuan.

Corrections officers wear masks. My daughter says none of her inmates wear masks. Hao recalled that he had no idea about the disease, so on the day of the meeting on the 21st, none of the family wore masks.

Unexpectedly, two days later at 2:00 a.m. , news came that Wuhan would be "closed" after 8 hours, at 10:00 on the 23rd.

On This Day, Zhang Wanghong came to the Guangzhou detention center, he is a partner of Guangqiang Law Firm, Financial Crime Defense and Research Center Director. In the interview room, he saw an orchid in a light pink sweater and handcuffs, his 15th meeting with the client in four months.

Detained in the detention center can not talk to the outside world or meet, only through a lawyer to meet, Zhang Wanghong became the 49-year-old orchid and her 70-year-old husband's only connection.

When asked how the detention center epidemic prevention, Orchid answer to Zhang Wanghong a little surprised: "Oh, is everyone issued a packet of Banlangen, a very small packet. ". This reminds Zhang of 2003, when he was working in the police station of Guangzhou Railway Station during the SARS epidemic.

At the time of his meeting, Guangdong Province launched a first-level response to a major public health emergency.

On January 24, the second day of the closure, Hubei Province upgraded its secondary response to a major public health event to a first-level response, and the prison system responded accordingly. On January 25, the Hubei Prison System entered a state of war, the activation of a closed duty mechanism, the relatives of prisoners to meet all stopped.

The last state of war was SARS. " A prison officer in Linyi, Shandong Province, told "the occasional cure. Prisons in the provinces of Sichuan, Heilongjiang and Jilin entered wartime management only on February 22, when the prison epidemic was revealed.

The 17-year-old state of war, so that prison officers and prison doctors sense a different atmosphere. On Jan. 26, Ye Danyan, a prison doctor in Wuhan who helped collect supplies from her unit, made several trips to the Wuhan Red Cross warehouse. Box after box of protective equipment beside her, she received a phone call telling her to go back to her unit and prepare to be boarded up.

Huang Chengli, a prison doctor in Jingzhou, Hubei Province, received news of the lockdown on Jan. 24. He told the "occasional cure" that from the start he had told the prison to prepare enough rooms for isolation, "we've cleared a floor. ".

Rencheng District Prison Second Sergeant Wang Qinggang, the third day of the Lunar New Year just got home from work, to the prison closed duty notice arrived. The first group of 80 officers under the closed management of Rencheng District prison arrived at 1730 hours on 27 January.

Solitary confinement became the norm before admission to the holding area, with the exception of the first group of prison officers, who were treated the same as those serving their sentences. The prison has initiated a "three-shift, three-shift, three-shift" police operation mode, which divides police officers into three shifts. The first batch will be sent directly to the detention area for closed duty, while the second batch will be quarantined for 14 days in the isolation area of the prison. After the nucleic acid test is negative, into the holding area to take over the first shift, then the first shift to be quarantined for another 14 days before they can go home.

On February 7, the newly established temporary new isolation unit in Shanghai's new intake prison completed its first intake of prisoners, who will be kept in isolation for 14 days.

"In the first wave of closed correctional facilities, it can not be ruled out that some people are already in a latent state of infection, and that part of the population becomes the source of infection. Liang Jianbao, a prison doctor in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, told "occasional cure" that he was also among the first to be placed on duty in isolation, starting on the first day of the Lunar New Year.

The second group of officers from a prison in Baoding, Hebei Province, were quarantined in a secret location. Zhao Ziye, the prison's doctor, told the "occasional cure" that it had been used before the Gaokao for the teachers who produced the papers, as well as for the staff who printed them.

"If you have a history of travel, travel, or any other high-risk situation, you will be given a single room in isolation, as will medical personnel in your home. ". The others are three or four to a room. " A prison officer in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, told the "occasional cure.

The second detention center meeting during the outbreak took place on February 5, and lawyer Zhang Wanghong did not expect his appointment to the Guangzhou detention center to be so smooth. At that time, the Beijing detention center has restricted meetings except for court sessions, and Henan and other provinces suspended all meetings.

The orchid sitting across from him wore a mask. Unlike January 23rd, the usual line of interview rooms was always empty, with only two rooms occupied at a glance. Zhang found that the detention center's epidemic prevention measures were gradually strengthened. When he met again on February 20, the meeting room was originally separated by a fence. Now, a layer of transparent plastic has been added to the fence.

With such tight controls, many believe prisons are the safest place to be during an outbreak. Sina reprinted on May 19,2003, "Heilongjiang daily" published a letter called "I am here the safest" , is the Agou prison inmate Liu Huili to his wife.

This is the safest place for SARS. The prison is completely closed and there are no dead ends. I'm safer here than you are. .. He was about to be released from prison, Liu wrote. No one in Beijing's prison system was reported to have been infected during the SARS period.

No one thought the prison stereotype was about to break.

Thunderstorm

On February 11, the official public account of Rencheng District's prisons published "hard core fight, fight again! " , accompanied by a petition covered with 80 bright red handprints.

Three days before the first officer was diagnosed, 80 of Rencheng District's first closed prison officers signed a letter of challenge.

Some people endure abdominal pain to delay surgery, some people long-term lack of sleep caused blood pressure spikes, some people let disinfection water corrosion peeling... .. The article said that the news, has made this epidemic prevention and control of interdiction phase victory.

A day later, it was over in a flash.

According to Leo Wu, the newly appointed Party secretary and director of the Shandong Provincial Prison Administration Bureau, there were police officers in Rencheng District who developed cough symptoms in early February. On the afternoon of February 12, a police officer on duty was admitted to the hospital for cough and was isolated. He was diagnosed at 2200 hours the next night.

Also on the 13th, at 1800 hours that same night, another back-up officer was diagnosed.

At 23:00 that night, Shandong Provincial Party Committee, the provincial government received the report, the Organization of the relevant areas for closed management, screening, isolation, treatment.

At 1730 hours on 27 January, the first group of 80 closed management officers from Rencheng District prison moved into the detention area.

According to media reports, the first officer who became ill had a family member who came home from Wuhan. He and the second officer who became ill shared a room while on duty. February 6,9, the two officers have fever, but in 10 were allowed to go home isolation, which is considered by the Rencheng District prison epidemic prevention and control failure.

A Jining resident showed an emergency notice to the owner of the Rencheng District prison, the Roucy prison and the Riyan power plant to the "occasional cure" . The RIYAN power plant is next to the Roucy prison, and the Roucy coal mine is next to the Rencheng District prison, which was originally owned by the prison company.

On February 14, the government began screening and quarantining close contacts in Rencheng District prison, focusing on the civil service districts of Ren Xingjiayuan and Shun Tai Yuen. Among the 6 policemen, 4 live in Ren Xingjiayuan and 2 live in Shun Tai Garden.

At this time, the infection in the prison has not yet been announced, rumors once made some Jining residents panic, such as the owner of the golden lanting district in Huadu, opposite the prison in Roucy. Overnight, some local wechat groups broke up.

With the official announcement, the rumor was dispelled.

The prison officer was diagnosed, first appeared in Zhejiang. A 37-year-old male patient, who was diagnosed on January 28 and returned to Quzhou from Wuhan on January 19, developed cough and sputum on January 23 and was taken to hospital on the night of January 25 with normal body temperature, the Quzhou Health Commission reported. According to the source and "occasional cure" revealed that the patient is Zhejiang Province, Shilifeng prison dry guard, until the disease control department called the prison to request his to cooperate with testing, the prison only to know and report the situation.

According to the Quzhou Health Commission, on February 10, new Quzhou confirmed six cases, all without a history of travel, the six onset of illness from January 28 to February 6.

It was not until February 21, when the prison outbreak became public, that the cases, which had not previously been disclosed in official communications, came to the fore. But this is just police business. Shandong and Zhejiang provinces both said that previously confirmed cases had been counted in local cases, but the number of prisoners was the first time that was released centrally.

"prisons in our province do not have access to the network reporting system of infectious diseases. The manual report card was received by the prison department on the night of February 20 before it was incorporated into the regional statistics. The Health Commission of Hubei Province explained.

Experts believe that the prison hospital, the provincial prison administration epidemic prevention station and CDC, information resources have not realized real-time sharing. It is difficult for prisons to link up with the emergency command system of local governments and avoid double command.

Zhao Ziye, a prison doctor in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, said the prison is a provincial-level directly managed unit. "there may be situations in which the provincial bureau reports to the provincial CDC, but the lower-level CDC units do not know, " he said.

An individual police officer's idea, let other colleagues all pay for naught. A police officer at a prison in Shilifeng, Zhejiang Province, deliberately concealed that he had been to Wuhan and continued to work, officials said. A police officer at Hanjin prison in Shayang, Hubei Province, did not report his life track truthfully.

All officers test for nucleic acid before lockdown? You had to see if the province had the capacity. So it's hard to defend against manpower. Now something happened, a social scold, and finally is the prison staff and prison doctors take the blame, think bad luck. Liang Jianbao said that financial input to prisons at all levels was limited and the construction of prison hospitals was lagging behind. Compared with local hospitals, prison doctors do not have the technical rank or the opportunity to be promoted, nor do they have the opportunity to be promoted or the treatment to be given. "

Prison officers were among the first to fall, straining a prison that was already short of staff because of shifts. The Bureau of Prison Administration of the Ministry of Justice mobilized several provinces to assist the Hubei prison system, which has been in place since at least February 8.

The notice came late in the night of February 8th. At that time, Li Yan, deputy director of the Chenzhou Prison Hospital in Hunan, was about to end the first batch of closed duty.

The husband, who had gone to the prison to pick up his wife, thought Li Yan was going home to rest, and was lost in thought when he heard that she had brought some clothes and was going to Hubei. Li Yan then presented the group with a challenge, with a bright red handprint.

Twenty-two prison officers in Hunan Province, all women, had to be in Hunan Province women's prison isolation 14 days, before the mission to Hubei. On February 23, when the quarantine ended, they set out from Changsha. Before departure, each team member was given an immune-boosting thymosin injection.

They know they're dealing with an anxious, sensitive prisoner who's worried about being infected. "there is a high level of contact between correctional officers and inmates, with an average of six officers per prisoner per day. Zhao Ziye said prisoners had to be at least three people together for any activity, including going to the toilet. But some rules in response to the epidemic and Change, stop all inter-cell behavior, reduce activity units, activities in batches, eat at the wrong time.

"despite their mistakes, they want to be treated fairly. "

A person with his daughter in swaddling clothes, borrow money to spend, Zhao Rui this month had a muddle-headed, finally waiting for her husband's news. On February 26, Zhao Rui, who was in another province, received a notification from the Shandong Municipal Bureau of Justice that her husband had been diagnosed.

She couldn't believe it. Two days ago, the Party secretary of the village where her husband was registered, verbally informed her mother-in-law that he was fine.

He's only seen the baby once, "and that's when he's on trial. "Zhao Rui, 30, said. Her husband was sentenced to seven years for economic crimes.

On February 26, a staff member of the Municipal Bureau of Justice added Zhao Rui's Wechat, asking for a video chat on Wechat, asking Zhao Rui to hold an ID card to confirm, saying that she would send Zhao Rui a notification by post to inform her husband of the diagnosis. Zhao Rui listened to, can not control ground bawls, frightened the child, she holds the child to cry together.

Zhao Rui asked for direct contact with the prison. At 17:53 on February 26, the staff sent a wechat message to Zhao Rui, "the Rencheng District prison officers have all been replaced, the former officers are in isolation, the officers from Zoucheng are unaware of the situation, and I can't give you a phone. We can't get in touch with him in isolation. I'm sorry.".

February 21 was a tearful day for Liu Xiawei. The year before, her child had left her, and this year, her husband, who was far away, was cast into shadow again.

Since her husband went to prison on January 8, she has not heard from him since. "I cry every day, " Liu said to the "occasional cure. ". The News of the prison epidemic added to her worries.

On February 24, she called Hanjin prison for the first time, and the prison checked with her family members to enter the prison time, identity cards and household registration, and other information, to her reply. The next day, the prison called to tell her that her husband was healthy.

She wanted to know what cell block he was in, whether the outbreak had occurred in his cell block, when he would be able to visit, "but they didn't say anything. They said it was confidential. ".

Happy Families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Since his daughter's arrest in March 2019, Hao has given up his job in Shandong Province to study law.

Like my daughters, they are also mothers, wives and daughters. Hao Fenglou made two phone calls to the Wuhan Women's prison. His story was not the same. The first caller said, "no one is allowed to make phone calls when it is so serious in the prison. " The second caller said, will allow everyone to contact their families.

Trademark, 55, has one year left on her sentence after her mother was sentenced to one year and eight months for impersonating a police officer. Since her mother's arrest in July 2018, she has not received a phone call from her mother. They don't allow family visits at the detention center, and she just sees her mother from a distance during the trial, and she can't talk.

"By law, family members are allowed to speak on the phone or visit inmates before they leave the facility, but Huangshi didn't inform me. "said Joyano.

Since her mother left the detention center on Jan. 20, Joyoano has been trying to find out where she is. Through lawyers to the judge, she asked for the Wuhan Women's prison contact information, but the prison has not told her mother's Cell Block. From February 10 onwards, Joyoya calls the prison many times, the other side's reply is often, do not tell the prison district, it is not possible to inquire.

Long-term look forward to, in the knowledge of the prison epidemic at the moment into a panic, Joe Youye those days into a sleeplessness. On February 24, she finally received a call from the prison telling her that her mother was healthy.

Joyoano asked: are the uninfected inmates completely separated from the infected ones? The other side asked her a: This should not need me to report to you?

The call was cut off for 49 seconds. She had a recording.

The difficulties in communication with the prison have caused resentment among some family members of the inmates. "The prison is responsible, " they said.

"In what was supposed to be the safest prison in the world, "the Surprise were invaded by a virus, "and they were helpless in it. "Liu Xiawei said.

Ms. Yoonoe said she wanted to hear from her mother that she was safe and that she would only call once a week.

"On February 20,11 staff members from Wuhan Women's prison were referred to the critical isolation ward of our hospital. " Li Hanzhao, a doctor at Wuhan University People's Hospital, told the "occasional cure" that it was the only resettlement hospital known to the families.

Her husband has always given Zhao Rui hope, when the prison warden immediately after imprisonment, often told her to actively reform, strive for praise, strive for commutation.

"I want the prison to give a statement to the convicted felon. During the prison diagnosis, even if cured, but also to go through a lot of pain, for no reason from the death of a once, and later face unknown sequelae. Zhao said her husband had suffered from emphysema before, and she was especially afraid that his lungs would suffer.

Take care of yourself. There's a long way to go. "This is what Liu Xiawei wanted to say after she had resumed contact with her husband.

"Don't change until you've had enough. "

How different is the real prison from the prison I thought it was. Zhou Yanghui applied for the post of Law Grade II police chief and below in a prison in Zhejiang. After studying for the exam, he first learned that the exam had been postponed and was later shocked by the incident of prison infection. "Police Dream" hesitated.

The written examination for civil servants in Zhejiang Province was originally scheduled for February 22-23. The delayed announcement was announced on January 29. The exact time of the written examination has yet to be determined. And so did his heart.

Also postponed is the second batch of duty officers to go to jail. Zhao said her prison had been notified of the cancellation of the scheduled departure of the second group of police officers because of an outbreak in several prisons. The third batch of officers in isolation after 21 days, into the prison district on duty, but the second shift, still have to be isolated in the prison district.

On 22 February, the Ministry of Justice introduced a new model of policing, with prisons throughout the country going through the end of the war, meaning that the police on duty in the prisons would no longer rotate until the epidemic was over.

This means that in many places the second batch of closed police officers will continue to be on duty, while in Shandong and Hubei provinces the first batch of closed police officers will not be rotated. "My husband's unit has a couple who are both policemen. His wife is locked up in the second batch, and his husband is isolated in the third batch. He can not get in or out. A family member of a prison guard in Sichuan told the "occasional cure" .

It is understood that the Shanghai prison system is currently in the prevention and control front-line personnel, there are nearly 200 police couples, police medical couples have more than 100 couples.

"working for 70 days straight, you have to keep your eyes on the prisoners in the cell block, night shift staring... " a prison officer said to the "occasional cure. " "The end of World War I" meant doing all the work of several people on his own, he won't be able to divide the work of others. He'll have to learn the hard way, "do you think I have a big head? "

"usually two night shifts a month. Now it's night shift every day. After the night shift, you can rest for three hours. There's no rotations when the quarantine expires, which means he and I won't see each other for two months. Speaking to the "occasional cure" , Zeng Jiaxin said her husband, a prison guard from Jiangxi Province, left home on January 29 and spent 14 days in isolation and another 14 days on duty in the detention area. When the prison outbreak broke, her husband was told that the third group would not be sent to the jail, and that the second group would stay on duty until the outbreak was over.

Tseng ka-yan is a nurse, often on the night shift, simply do not care about home, children 1-year-old, "love, he took a needle and thread to help me mend my pants, I think I must marry him. ". I don't know what to do now that the gas is gone.".

"My boyfriend was recalled on the second day of the Lunar New Year, and has been working three nights a week. After the night shift, he still goes to work the next day. A family member of a prison guard in Jilin told the "occasional cure" that the prison usually has few overnight guests and limited beds. They can only sleep at the conference table and on the door panel. The temporary bed is only 1.6 meters, but he is 1.8 meters. Huang Chengli said, she has been in reserve duty isolation for a month, do not know why not into the prison shift, the boss said that the incubation period is extended, not in accordance with the original plan.

With the outbreak of the epidemic in many prisons, let the infected and still in the front line of the prison staff ushered in a storm of public opinion, which the cold eyes and ridicule, let them feel sad.

Prison officers and medical staff are unable to return home because of the outbreak, but in the eyes of everyone, one is the devil, one is an angel. "Tsang said she had been on the front lines of the outbreak.

Peace be with you, send you warm embrace. "said Xu Xuefeng, the wife of Rencheng District prison officer Wang Qinggang.

"If there's no problem in there, don't change shifts, " said several guards who had been asked what conditions allowed them to leave their shifts.

Zhang Hui, a 49-year-old prison guard, died at 2 a.m. on Feb. 13 after 17 consecutive days on duty.

On February 20, Tan Bi, a 46-year-old Yizhou prison police officer, was killed in the line of duty in central isolation.

The prison epidemic continues to spread. According to the Wuhan release on February 25, Yao Gang, a police officer in Hanjin prison, was recommended as a national model worker (advanced individual) and was announced between February 20 and 24. On Feb. 27, the Hubei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions announced that it had decided, after a meeting, not to make Yao Gang a candidate because of the outbreak in his unit.

"What's wrong with Yao Gang? This arbitrary, unquestioning way of beating a boatload of people over the head with one stick is truly chilling. "A prison guard Dachimawa Lee him.

He fell ill in a Wuhan prison, and was diagnosed after he arrived in Beijing from Wuhan after being released from prison. Huang Dengying, 61, caused a public opinion shock recently. On February 26, the central joint investigation team went to Hubei, to conduct an investigation into the incident of "persons released from Wuhan Women's prison with new pneumonia coming to Beijing" .

She and many of the prisoners, since the outbreak, has been hoping to receive reports of safe calls from family members, to know the treatment of confirmed family members, their demands have repeatedly hit a brick wall.

With the February 21 disclosure of the news, prison officers and the prison population was suddenly pushed into the hot search, mixed with emotions of public opinion wave came, there was silence behind bars.

It was also reported that 11 persons had been removed from their posts in the prison system, one had been given a serious warning by the Party and one had been placed under investigation.

In the same period, the number of newly confirmed cases in the country has exceeded 20. Why did the number of cases in high-security prisons rise as the country's epidemic improved?

"The Wuhan Women's prison is less than 100 meters away from the Wuhan Lung Hospital. The prison officers commute to work at the same bus stop as the hospital staff. The virus may have been introduced before the prison was fully closed. The outbreaks in Hanjin prison in Hubei, Shilifeng prison in Zhejiang and Rencheng District prison in Shandong were all caused by the inputting of imported cases due to the incompletion of isolation and misreporting by individual police officers after contacting the personnel in the Hubei Epidemic area. "Xiong Xianguo, Vice Minister of Justice, said at a State Council press conference on February 26.

Some prisoners'families expressed the hope that the prison would give the convicted prisoners the compassionate release and other opportunities. Some prison staff members'families lamented that the prison staff were overworked and that the date of ending the closure of the prison had been repeatedly postponed, and they would not see their families for 50 to 60 days.

"Occasional Cure" has contacted more than 20 prison officers, prison doctors, relatives of inmates and prison guards to try to restore the human feelings behind the incident.

The last "state of war" was SARS

This Spring Festival, for Liu Xiawei, a native of Jingzhou, Hubei Province, has been particularly difficult. The blows have come one after another, with children dying early, husbands in prison and New Year's dinners becoming lifeless.

It was the seventh year of Liu Xiawei's marriage. On January 8, her husband was taken from the Shashi District detention centre to prison, where he was sentenced to 13 years. It was only 13 days after her husband's imprisonment that Liu Xiawei learned he was in Hanjin prison. First three months are a training camp, no visits.

Also that day, in Wuhan, Hao Fenglou's 29-year-old daughter was transferred from Xiaogan Detention Center to Wuhan Women's prison. They went to prison together. 12 colleagues, all for wire fraud. On the 14th of January, a man came to see his daughter, and my daughter sent me a complaint, saying that she had no money, and was not allowed to take money with her when she was in prison. "said Hau fung-lau and"occasional cure".

Wuhan Women's prison, built in 1917 during the Beiyang government period, retains the old-style building, is one of China's oldest prison construction.

"It was only through communication between the families of the inmates that we learned that the local detention centre had not informed us when their families were taken away. My mother left the first detention center in yellowstone on January 20, without any notice, and for a while I didn't know where she was. " Henan Girl Qiao Youye told "occasional cure" that she had made twenty phone calls asking her mother to go to Wuhan Women's prison.

There are only three channels of communication between prisoners and their families: prison visits, telephone calls and Letters. Like many prisons, Rencheng District prison visits every Wednesday and once a month. The call is five minutes twice a month.

I'm married to him as a matter of fact, but we haven't been able to get a license yet. According to Article 48 of the Prisons Act, only relatives and guardians can exercise the right to visit him in prison, so I can not visit him in prison. Zhao said she had not seen her father for 13 months after her husband was taken from a detention center to Rencheng District prison. Foreign objects are not allowed in the prison. Zhao Rui sent a book to her husband and was refused a visa.

The only good news is, "maybe it's the new year. Last month he was allowed to make one more phone call. "

The call was made on January 25, the first day of the Lunar New Year, "he stood in line for half an hour and told me five minutes. ". This time, the husband did not mention "all right" to Zhao Rui, which was a hit show he was following in prison, but the tone was a little more worried, he said of the epidemic, let his wife take the baby do not go out, buy what let his sister sent.

"He used to say it was hard for me to take the baby alone and not have to mop the floor very often, but this time he said it was very important to mop the floor often and use sterile water. " Zhao said she did not expect to remind her husband to do protection, because she thought the prison is "the safest place.

The shadow of the epidemic is looming, and Wuhan is still welcoming the New Year.

On January 14, Wuhan Women's prison organized a "family visit" event; on January 17, it held a CCTV New Year's Gala for civilian police workers, attended by representatives of some retired civilian police officers and their families; and on January 18, the Baibu Pavilion Community hosted a family dinner for more than 40,000 families On January 20, the Hubei Provincial Bureau of Prison Administration held a New Year's Party with 14 female police officers from Wuhan Women's prison participating in the show. The alarm that did not pull, let gather sexual activity to carry on as usual, hidden danger is buried from this.

On January 20, the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Culture and tourism distributed 200,000 tickets for scenic spots to encourage citizens to go out and have fun. On that day, 33,058 citizens made successful bookings. On the same day, Academician Zhong Nanshan confirmed that the new coronavirus "human to human" .

On January 15, Hao Fenglou came to Wuhan from Xiaogan, but he was a day late. The prison only allowed him to visit the prison on Tuesdays. He sent 1,000 yuan to the police. On January 21, he finally met his daughter and gave her another 2,000 yuan.

Corrections officers wear masks. My daughter says none of her inmates wear masks. Hao recalled that he had no idea about the disease, so on the day of the meeting on the 21st, none of the family wore masks.

Unexpectedly, two days later at 2:00 a.m. , news came that Wuhan would be "closed" after 8 hours, at 10:00 on the 23rd.

On This Day, Zhang Wanghong came to the Guangzhou detention center, he is a partner of Guangqiang Law Firm, Financial Crime Defense and Research Center Director. In the interview room, he saw an orchid in a light pink sweater and handcuffs, his 15th meeting with the client in four months.

Detained in the detention center can not talk to the outside world or meet, only through a lawyer to meet, Zhang Wanghong became the 49-year-old orchid and her 70-year-old husband's only connection.

When asked how the detention center epidemic prevention, Orchid answer to Zhang Wanghong a little surprised: "Oh, is everyone issued a packet of Banlangen, a very small packet. ". This reminds Zhang of 2003, when he was working in the police station of Guangzhou Railway Station during the SARS epidemic.

At the time of his meeting, Guangdong Province launched a first-level response to a major public health emergency.

On January 24, the second day of the closure, Hubei Province upgraded its secondary response to a major public health event to a first-level response, and the prison system responded accordingly. On January 25, the Hubei Prison System entered a state of war, the activation of a closed duty mechanism, the relatives of prisoners to meet all stopped.

The last state of war was SARS. " A prison officer in Linyi, Shandong Province, told "the occasional cure. Prisons in the provinces of Sichuan, Heilongjiang and Jilin entered wartime management only on February 22, when the prison epidemic was revealed.

The 17-year-old state of war, so that prison officers and prison doctors sense a different atmosphere. On Jan. 26, Ye Danyan, a prison doctor in Wuhan who helped collect supplies from her unit, made several trips to the Wuhan Red Cross warehouse. Box after box of protective equipment beside her, she received a phone call telling her to go back to her unit and prepare to be boarded up.

Huang Chengli, a prison doctor in Jingzhou, Hubei Province, received news of the lockdown on Jan. 24. He told the "occasional cure" that from the start he had told the prison to prepare enough rooms for isolation, "we've cleared a floor. ".

Rencheng District Prison Second Sergeant Wang Qinggang, the third day of the Lunar New Year just got home from work, to the prison closed duty notice arrived. The first group of 80 officers under the closed management of Rencheng District prison arrived at 1730 hours on 27 January.

Solitary confinement became the norm before admission to the holding area, with the exception of the first group of prison officers, who were treated the same as those serving their sentences. The prison has initiated a "three-shift, three-shift, three-shift" police operation mode, which divides police officers into three shifts. The first batch will be sent directly to the detention area for closed duty, while the second batch will be quarantined for 14 days in the isolation area of the prison. After the nucleic acid test is negative, into the holding area to take over the first shift, then the first shift to be quarantined for another 14 days before they can go home.

On February 7, the newly established temporary new isolation unit in Shanghai's new intake prison completed its first intake of prisoners, who will be kept in isolation for 14 days.

"In the first wave of closed correctional facilities, it can not be ruled out that some people are already in a latent state of infection, and that part of the population becomes the source of infection. Liang Jianbao, a prison doctor in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, told "occasional cure" that he was also among the first to be placed on duty in isolation, starting on the first day of the Lunar New Year.

The second group of officers from a prison in Baoding, Hebei Province, were quarantined in a secret location. Zhao Ziye, the prison's doctor, told the "occasional cure" that it had been used before the Gaokao for the teachers who produced the papers, as well as for the staff who printed them.

"If you have a history of travel, travel, or any other high-risk situation, you will be given a single room in isolation, as will medical personnel in your home. ". The others are three or four to a room. " A prison officer in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, told the "occasional cure.

The second detention center meeting during the outbreak took place on February 5, and lawyer Zhang Wanghong did not expect his appointment to the Guangzhou detention center to be so smooth. At that time, the Beijing detention center has restricted meetings except for court sessions, and Henan and other provinces suspended all meetings.

The orchid sitting across from him wore a mask. Unlike January 23rd, the usual line of interview rooms was always empty, with only two rooms occupied at a glance. Zhang found that the detention center's epidemic prevention measures were gradually strengthened. When he met again on February 20, the meeting room was originally separated by a fence. Now, a layer of transparent plastic has been added to the fence.

With such tight controls, many believe prisons are the safest place to be during an outbreak. Sina reprinted on May 19,2003, "Heilongjiang daily" published a letter called "I am here the safest" , is the Agou prison inmate Liu Huili to his wife.

This is the safest place for SARS. The prison is completely closed and there are no dead ends. I'm safer here than you are. .. He was about to be released from prison, Liu wrote. No one in Beijing's prison system was reported to have been infected during the SARS period.

No one thought the prison stereotype was about to break.

He fell ill in a Wuhan prison, and was diagnosed after he arrived in Beijing from Wuhan after being released from prison. Huang Dengying, 61, caused a public opinion shock recently. On February 26, the central joint investigation team went to Hubei, to conduct an investigation into the incident of "persons released from Wuhan Women's prison with new pneumonia coming to Beijing" .

"Huang Dengying and my wife are in the same cell block, the Second Cell Block of Section 11 of Wuhan Women's prison. "I am happy to be alive, " Zhao said to "occasionally cured" of his worries about his wife.

On February 24th, the notice from the village was that the husband was healthy. On February 26, the Department of Justice informed me that my husband had been diagnosed. " Zhao Rui, the wife of a prisoner at Rencheng District prison in Shandong Province, told the "occasional cure" . She and many of the prisoners, since the outbreak, has been hoping to receive reports of safe calls from family members, to know the treatment of confirmed family members, their demands have repeatedly hit a brick wall.

With the February 21 disclosure of the news, prison officers and the prison population was suddenly pushed into the hot search, mixed with emotions of public opinion wave came, there was silence behind bars.

According to reports, as of the 23rd, Wuhan Women's prison confirmed the largest number of 279 cases, Jining Rencheng District prison confirmed 207 cases.

On January 24, the second day of the closure, Hubei Province upgraded its secondary response to a major public health event to a first-level response, and the prison system responded accordingly. On January 25, the Hubei Prison System entered a state of war, the activation of a closed duty mechanism, the relatives of prisoners to meet all stopped.

The last state of war was SARS. " A prison officer in Linyi, Shandong Province, told "the occasional cure. Prisons in the provinces of Sichuan, Heilongjiang and Jilin entered wartime management only on February 22, when the prison epidemic was revealed.

The 17-year-old state of war, so that prison officers and prison doctors sense a different atmosphere. On Jan. 26, Ye Danyan, a prison doctor in Wuhan who helped collect supplies from her unit, made several trips to the Wuhan Red Cross warehouse. Box after box of protective equipment beside her, she received a phone call telling her to go back to her unit and prepare to be boarded up.

Huang Chengli, a prison doctor in Jingzhou, Hubei Province, received news of the lockdown on Jan. 24. He told the "occasional cure" that from the start he had told the prison to prepare enough rooms for isolation, "we've cleared a floor. ".

Rencheng District Prison Second Sergeant Wang Qinggang, the third day of the Lunar New Year just got home from work, to the prison closed duty notice arrived. The first group of 80 officers under the closed management of Rencheng District prison arrived at 1730 hours on 27 January.

Solitary confinement became the norm before admission to the holding area, with the exception of the first group of prison officers, who were treated the same as those serving their sentences. The prison has initiated a "three-shift, three-shift, three-shift" police operation mode, which divides police officers into three shifts. The first batch will be sent directly to the detention area for closed duty, while the second batch will be quarantined for 14 days in the isolation area of the prison. After the nucleic acid test is negative, into the holding area to take over the first shift, then the first shift to be quarantined for another 14 days before they can go home.

On February 7, the newly established temporary new isolation unit in Shanghai's new intake prison completed its first intake of prisoners, who will be kept in isolation for 14 days.

"In the first wave of closed correctional facilities, it can not be ruled out that some people are already in a latent state of infection, and that part of the population becomes the source of infection. Liang Jianbao, a prison doctor in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, told "occasional cure" that he was also among the first to be placed on duty in isolation, starting on the first day of the Lunar New Year.

The second group of officers from a prison in Baoding, Hebei Province, were quarantined in a secret location. Zhao Ziye, the prison's doctor, told the "occasional cure" that it had been used before the Gaokao for the teachers who produced the papers, as well as for the staff who printed them.

"If you have a history of travel, travel, or any other high-risk situation, you will be given a single room in isolation, as will medical personnel in your home. ". The others are three or four to a room. " A prison officer in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, told the "occasional cure.

The second detention center meeting during the outbreak took place on February 5, and lawyer Zhang Wanghong did not expect his appointment to the Guangzhou detention center to be so smooth. At that time, the Beijing detention center has restricted meetings except for court sessions, and Henan and other provinces suspended all meetings.

The orchid sitting across from him wore a mask. Unlike January 23rd, the usual line of interview rooms was always empty, with only two rooms occupied at a glance. Zhang found that the detention center's epidemic prevention measures were gradually strengthened. When he met again on February 20, the meeting room was originally separated by a fence. Now, a layer of transparent plastic has been added to the fence.

With such tight controls, many believe prisons are the safest place to be during an outbreak. Sina reprinted on May 19,2003, "Heilongjiang daily" published a letter called "I am here the safest" , is the Agou prison inmate Liu Huili to his wife.

This is the safest place for SARS. The prison is completely closed and there are no dead ends. I'm safer here than you are. .. He was about to be released from prison, Liu wrote. No one in Beijing's prison system was reported to have been infected during the SARS period.

No one thought the prison stereotype was about to break.

Thunderstorm

On February 11, the official public account of Rencheng District's prisons published "hard core fight, fight again! " , accompanied by a petition covered with 80 bright red handprints.

Three days before the first officer was diagnosed, 80 of Rencheng District's first closed prison officers signed a letter of challenge.

Some people endure abdominal pain to delay surgery, some people long-term lack of sleep caused blood pressure spikes, some people let disinfection water corrosion peeling... .. The article said that the news, has made this epidemic prevention and control of interdiction phase victory.

A day later, it was over in a flash.

According to Leo Wu, the newly appointed Party secretary and director of the Shandong Provincial Prison Administration Bureau, there were police officers in Rencheng District who developed cough symptoms in early February. On the afternoon of February 12, a police officer on duty was admitted to the hospital for cough and was isolated. He was diagnosed at 2200 hours the next night.

Also on the 13th, at 1800 hours that same night, another back-up officer was diagnosed.

At 23:00 that night, Shandong Provincial Party Committee, the provincial government received the report, the Organization of the relevant areas for closed management, screening, isolation, treatment.

At 1730 hours on 27 January, the first group of 80 closed management officers from Rencheng District prison moved into the detention area.

According to media reports, the first officer who became ill had a family member who came home from Wuhan. He and the second officer who became ill shared a room while on duty. February 6,9, the two officers have fever, but in 10 were allowed to go home isolation, which is considered by the Rencheng District prison epidemic prevention and control failure.

A Jining resident showed an emergency notice to the owner of the Rencheng District prison, the Roucy prison and the Riyan power plant to the "occasional cure" . The RIYAN power plant is next to the Roucy prison, and the Roucy coal mine is next to the Rencheng District prison, which was originally owned by the prison company.

On February 14, the government began screening and quarantining close contacts in Rencheng District prison, focusing on the civil service districts of Ren Xingjiayuan and Shun Tai Yuen. Among the 6 policemen, 4 live in Ren Xingjiayuan and 2 live in Shun Tai Garden.

At this time, the infection in the prison has not yet been announced, rumors once made some Jining residents panic, such as the owner of the golden lanting district in Huadu, opposite the prison in Roucy. Overnight, some local wechat groups broke up.

With the official announcement, the rumor was dispelled.

The prison officer was diagnosed, first appeared in Zhejiang. A 37-year-old male patient, who was diagnosed on January 28 and returned to Quzhou from Wuhan on January 19, developed cough and sputum on January 23 and was taken to hospital on the night of January 25 with normal body temperature, the Quzhou Health Commission reported. According to the source and "occasional cure" revealed that the patient is Zhejiang Province, Shilifeng prison dry guard, until the disease control department called the prison to request his to cooperate with testing, the prison only to know and report the situation.

According to the Quzhou Health Commission, on February 10, new Quzhou confirmed six cases, all without a history of travel, the six onset of illness from January 28 to February 6.

It was not until February 21, when the prison outbreak became public, that the cases, which had not previously been disclosed in official communications, came to the fore. But this is just police business. Shandong and Zhejiang provinces both said that previously confirmed cases had been counted in local cases, but the number of prisoners was the first time that was released centrally.

"prisons in our province do not have access to the network reporting system of infectious diseases. The manual report card was received by the prison department on the night of February 20 before it was incorporated into the regional statistics. The Health Commission of Hubei Province explained.

Experts believe that the prison hospital, the provincial prison administration epidemic prevention station and CDC, information resources have not realized real-time sharing. It is difficult for prisons to link up with the emergency command system of local governments and avoid double command.

Zhao Ziye, a prison doctor in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, said the prison is a provincial-level directly managed unit. "there may be situations in which the provincial bureau reports to the provincial CDC, but the lower-level CDC units do not know, " he said.

An individual police officer's idea, let other colleagues all pay for naught. A police officer at a prison in Shilifeng, Zhejiang Province, deliberately concealed that he had been to Wuhan and continued to work, officials said. A police officer at Hanjin prison in Shayang, Hubei Province, did not report his life track truthfully.

All officers test for nucleic acid before lockdown? You had to see if the province had the capacity. So it's hard to defend against manpower. Now something happened, a social scold, and finally is the prison staff and prison doctors take the blame, think bad luck. Liang Jianbao said that financial input to prisons at all levels was limited and the construction of prison hospitals was lagging behind. Compared with local hospitals, prison doctors do not have the technical rank or the opportunity to be promoted, nor do they have the opportunity to be promoted or the treatment to be given. "

Prison officers were among the first to fall, straining a prison that was already short of staff because of shifts. The Bureau of Prison Administration of the Ministry of Justice mobilized several provinces to assist the Hubei prison system, which has been in place since at least February 8.

The notice came late in the night of February 8th. At that time, Li Yan, deputy director of the Chenzhou Prison Hospital in Hunan, was about to end the first batch of closed duty.

The husband, who had gone to the prison to pick up his wife, thought Li Yan was going home to rest, and was lost in thought when he heard that she had brought some clothes and was going to Hubei. Li Yan then presented the group with a challenge, with a bright red handprint.

Twenty-two prison officers in Hunan Province, all women, had to be in Hunan Province women's prison isolation 14 days, before the mission to Hubei. On February 23, when the quarantine ended, they set out from Changsha. Before departure, each team member was given an immune-boosting thymosin injection.

They know they're dealing with an anxious, sensitive prisoner who's worried about being infected. "there is a high level of contact between correctional officers and inmates, with an average of six officers per prisoner per day. Zhao Ziye said prisoners had to be at least three people together for any activity, including going to the toilet. But some rules in response to the epidemic and Change, stop all inter-cell behavior, reduce activity units, activities in batches, eat at the wrong time.

On February 11, the official public account of Rencheng District's prisons published "hard core fight, fight again! " , accompanied by a petition covered with 80 bright red handprints.

Three days before the first officer was diagnosed, 80 of Rencheng District's first closed prison officers signed a letter of challenge.

"despite their mistakes, they want to be treated fairly. "

A person with his daughter in swaddling clothes, borrow money to spend, Zhao Rui this month had a muddle-headed, finally waiting for her husband's news. On February 26, Zhao Rui, who was in another province, received a notification from the Shandong Municipal Bureau of Justice that her husband had been diagnosed.

She couldn't believe it. Two days ago, the Party secretary of the village where her husband was registered, verbally informed her mother-in-law that he was fine.

He's only seen the baby once, "and that's when he's on trial. "Zhao Rui, 30, said. Her husband was sentenced to seven years for economic crimes.

On February 26, a staff member of the Municipal Bureau of Justice added Zhao Rui's Wechat, asking for a video chat on Wechat, asking Zhao Rui to hold an ID card to confirm, saying that she would send Zhao Rui a notification by post to inform her husband of the diagnosis. Zhao Rui listened to, can not control ground bawls, frightened the child, she holds the child to cry together.

Zhao Rui asked for direct contact with the prison. At 17:53 on February 26, the staff sent a wechat message to Zhao Rui, "the Rencheng District prison officers have all been replaced, the former officers are in isolation, the officers from Zoucheng are unaware of the situation, and I can't give you a phone. We can't get in touch with him in isolation. I'm sorry.".

February 21 was a tearful day for Liu Xiawei. The year before, her child had left her, and this year, her husband, who was far away, was cast into shadow again.

Since her husband went to prison on January 8, she has not heard from him since. "I cry every day, " Liu said to the "occasional cure. ". The News of the prison epidemic added to her worries.

On February 24, she called Hanjin prison for the first time, and the prison checked with her family members to enter the prison time, identity cards and household registration, and other information, to her reply. The next day, the prison called to tell her that her husband was healthy.

She wanted to know what cell block he was in, whether the outbreak had occurred in his cell block, when he would be able to visit, "but they didn't say anything. They said it was confidential. ".

Happy Families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Since his daughter's arrest in March 2019, Hao has given up his job in Shandong Province to study law.

Like my daughters, they are also mothers, wives and daughters. Hao Fenglou made two phone calls to the Wuhan Women's prison. His story was not the same. The first caller said, "no one is allowed to make phone calls when it is so serious in the prison. " The second caller said, will allow everyone to contact their families.

Trademark, 55, has one year left on her sentence after her mother was sentenced to one year and eight months for impersonating a police officer. Since her mother's arrest in July 2018, she has not received a phone call from her mother. They don't allow family visits at the detention center, and she just sees her mother from a distance during the trial, and she can't talk.

"By law, family members are allowed to speak on the phone or visit inmates before they leave the facility, but Huangshi didn't inform me. "said Joyano.

Since her mother left the detention center on Jan. 20, Joyoano has been trying to find out where she is. Through lawyers to the judge, she asked for the Wuhan Women's prison contact information, but the prison has not told her mother's Cell Block. From February 10 onwards, Joyoya calls the prison many times, the other side's reply is often, do not tell the prison district, it is not possible to inquire.

Long-term look forward to, in the knowledge of the prison epidemic at the moment into a panic, Joe Youye those days into a sleeplessness. On February 24, she finally received a call from the prison telling her that her mother was healthy.

Joyoano asked: are the uninfected inmates completely separated from the infected ones? The other side asked her a: This should not need me to report to you?

The call was cut off for 49 seconds. She had a recording.

The difficulties in communication with the prison have caused resentment among some family members of the inmates. "The prison is responsible, " they said.

"In what was supposed to be the safest prison in the world, "the Surprise were invaded by a virus, "and they were helpless in it. "Liu Xiawei said.

Ms. Yoonoe said she wanted to hear from her mother that she was safe and that she would only call once a week.

"On February 20,11 staff members from Wuhan Women's prison were referred to the critical isolation ward of our hospital. " Li Hanzhao, a doctor at Wuhan University People's Hospital, told the "occasional cure" that it was the only resettlement hospital known to the families.

Her husband has always given Zhao Rui hope, when the prison warden immediately after imprisonment, often told her to actively reform, strive for praise, strive for commutation.

"I want the prison to give a statement to the convicted felon. During the prison diagnosis, even if cured, but also to go through a lot of pain, for no reason from the death of a once, and later face unknown sequelae. Zhao said her husband had suffered from emphysema before, and she was especially afraid that his lungs would suffer.

Take care of yourself. There's a long way to go. "This is what Liu Xiawei wanted to say after she had resumed contact with her husband.

How different is the real prison from the prison I thought it was. Zhou Yanghui applied for the post of Law Grade II police chief and below in a prison in Zhejiang. After studying for the exam, he first learned that the exam had been postponed and was later shocked by the incident of prison infection. "Police Dream" hesitated.

The written examination for civil servants in Zhejiang Province was originally scheduled for February 22-23. The delayed announcement was announced on January 29. The exact time of the written examination has yet to be determined. And so did his heart.

Also postponed is the second batch of duty officers to go to jail. Zhao said her prison had been notified of the cancellation of the scheduled departure of the second group of police officers because of an outbreak in several prisons. The third batch of officers in isolation after 21 days, into the prison district on duty, but the second shift, still have to be isolated in the prison district.

On 22 February, the Ministry of Justice introduced a new model of policing, with prisons throughout the country going through the end of the war, meaning that the police on duty in the prisons would no longer rotate until the epidemic was over.

This means that in many places the second batch of closed police officers will continue to be on duty, while in Shandong and Hubei provinces the first batch of closed police officers will not be rotated. "My husband's unit has a couple who are both policemen. His wife is locked up in the second batch, and his husband is isolated in the third batch. He can not get in or out. A family member of a prison guard in Sichuan told the "occasional cure" .

It is understood that the Shanghai prison system is currently in the prevention and control front-line personnel, there are nearly 200 police couples, police medical couples have more than 100 couples.

"working for 70 days straight, you have to keep your eyes on the prisoners in the cell block, night shift staring... " a prison officer said to the "occasional cure. " "The end of World War I" meant doing all the work of several people on his own, he won't be able to divide the work of others. He'll have to learn the hard way, "do you think I have a big head? "

"usually two night shifts a month. Now it's night shift every day. After the night shift, you can rest for three hours. There's no rotations when the quarantine expires, which means he and I won't see each other for two months. Speaking to the "occasional cure" , Zeng Jiaxin said her husband, a prison guard from Jiangxi Province, left home on January 29 and spent 14 days in isolation and another 14 days on duty in the detention area. When the prison outbreak broke, her husband was told that the third group would not be sent to the jail, and that the second group would stay on duty until the outbreak was over.

Tseng ka-yan is a nurse, often on the night shift, simply do not care about home, children 1-year-old, "love, he took a needle and thread to help me mend my pants, I think I must marry him. ". I don't know what to do now that the gas is gone.".

"My boyfriend was recalled on the second day of the Lunar New Year, and has been working three nights a week. After the night shift, he still goes to work the next day. A family member of a prison guard in Jilin told the "occasional cure" that the prison usually has few overnight guests and limited beds. They can only sleep at the conference table and on the door panel. The temporary bed is only 1.6 meters, but he is 1.8 meters. Huang Chengli said, she has been in reserve duty isolation for a month, do not know why not into the prison shift, the boss said that the incubation period is extended, not in accordance with the original plan.

With the outbreak of the epidemic in many prisons, let the infected and still in the front line of the prison staff ushered in a storm of public opinion, which the cold eyes and ridicule, let them feel sad.

Prison officers and medical staff are unable to return home because of the outbreak, but in the eyes of everyone, one is the devil, one is an angel. "Tsang said she had been on the front lines of the outbreak.

Peace be with you, send you warm embrace. "said Xu Xuefeng, the wife of Rencheng District prison officer Wang Qinggang.

"If there's no problem in there, don't change shifts, " said several guards who had been asked what conditions allowed them to leave their shifts.

Zhang Hui, a 49-year-old prison guard, died at 2 a.m. on Feb. 13 after 17 consecutive days on duty.

On February 20, Tan Bi, a 46-year-old Yizhou prison police officer, was killed in the line of duty in central isolation.

The prison epidemic continues to spread. According to the Wuhan release on February 25, Yao Gang, a police officer in Hanjin prison, was recommended as a national model worker (advanced individual) and was announced between February 20 and 24. On Feb. 27, the Hubei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions announced that it had decided, after a meeting, not to make Yao Gang a candidate because of the outbreak in his unit.

"What's wrong with Yao Gang? This arbitrary, unquestioning way of beating a boatload of people over the head with one stick is truly chilling. "A prison guard Dachimawa Lee him.

How different is the real prison from the prison I thought it was. Zhou Yanghui applied for the post of Law Grade II police chief and below in a prison in Zhejiang. After studying for the exam, he first learned that the exam had been postponed and was later shocked by the incident of prison infection. "Police Dream" hesitated.

The written examination for civil servants in Zhejiang Province was originally scheduled for February 22-23. The delayed announcement was announced on January 29. The exact time of the written examination has yet to be determined. And so did his heart.

Also postponed is the second batch of duty officers to go to jail. Zhao said her prison had been notified of the cancellation of the scheduled departure of the second group of police officers because of an outbreak in several prisons. The third batch of officers in isolation after 21 days, into the prison district on duty, but the second shift, still have to be isolated in the prison district.

On 22 February, the Ministry of Justice introduced a new model of policing, with prisons throughout the country going through the end of the war, meaning that the police on duty in the prisons would no longer rotate until the epidemic was over.

This means that in many places the second batch of closed police officers will continue to be on duty, while in Shandong and Hubei provinces the first batch of closed police officers will not be rotated. "My husband's unit has a couple who are both policemen. His wife is locked up in the second batch, and his husband is isolated in the third batch. He can not get in or out. A family member of a prison guard in Sichuan told the "occasional cure" .

It is understood that the Shanghai prison system is currently in the prevention and control front-line personnel, there are nearly 200 police couples, police medical couples have more than 100 couples.

"working for 70 days straight, you have to keep your eyes on the prisoners in the cell block, night shift staring... " a prison officer said to the "occasional cure. " "The end of World War I" meant doing all the work of several people on his own, he won't be able to divide the work of others. He'll have to learn the hard way, "do you think I have a big head? "

"usually two night shifts a month. Now it's night shift every day. After the night shift, you can rest for three hours. There's no rotations when the quarantine expires, which means he and I won't see each other for two months. Speaking to the "occasional cure" , Zeng Jiaxin said her husband, a prison guard from Jiangxi Province, left home on January 29 and spent 14 days in isolation and another 14 days on duty in the detention area. When the prison outbreak broke, her husband was told that the third group would not be sent to the jail, and that the second group would stay on duty until the outbreak was over.

Tseng ka-yan is a nurse, often on the night shift, simply do not care about home, children 1-year-old, "love, he took a needle and thread to help me mend my pants, I think I must marry him. ". I don't know what to do now that the gas is gone.".

"My boyfriend was recalled on the second day of the Lunar New Year, and has been working three nights a week. After the night shift, he still goes to work the next day. A family member of a prison guard in Jilin told the "occasional cure" that the prison usually has few overnight guests and limited beds. They can only sleep at the conference table and on the door panel. The temporary bed is only 1.6 meters, but he is 1.8 meters. Huang Chengli said, she has been in reserve duty isolation for a month, do not know why not into the prison shift, the boss said that the incubation period is extended, not in accordance with the original plan.

With the outbreak of the epidemic in many prisons, let the infected and still in the front line of the prison staff ushered in a storm of public opinion, which the cold eyes and ridicule, let them feel sad.

Prison officers and medical staff are unable to return home because of the outbreak, but in the eyes of everyone, one is the devil, one is an angel. "Tsang said she had been on the front lines of the outbreak.

Peace be with you, send you warm embrace. "said Xu Xuefeng, the wife of Rencheng District prison officer Wang Qinggang.

"If there's no problem in there, don't change shifts, " said several guards who had been asked what conditions allowed them to leave their shifts.

Zhang Hui, a 49-year-old prison guard, died at 2 a.m. on Feb. 13 after 17 consecutive days on duty.
