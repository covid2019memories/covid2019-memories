Functional Introduction, light business, understand life.

From January to March, the flowers on the road open slowly, sometimes you can smell the fragrance of Magnolia denudata, spring has arrived, but the global epidemic is not yet in decline as temperatures rise -- men in France are buying baguettes full of shopping carts, and Italian residents are quarantined to sing opera on their windowsills, someone on Weibo analyzed which official in Donald Trump's circle was confirmed today, and Instagram featured a rare toilet paper ad..

Emotions can sometimes be so invisible, but they are still reflected in another medium, the financial markets. The stock market, gold prices and foreign exchange all experienced conditions not seen in many years. On March 9, the U.S. stock market opened with a quick start to the circuit breaker, the first time since 1997 that the circuit breaker mechanism was triggered. U.S. stocks suffered their fourth circuit breaker this month until China Standard Time. A-shares were also affected, with a sharp fall on March 11.

Where there is a fall, there is a rise. Where there is a danger, there is a chance. This spring is a season of rapid turnover of wealth. In the highly leveraged world of virtual currencies and options, 20 minutes may be enough to make a person rich and lose everything.

Some say they sit at home and their assets evaporate like moisture. Behind those numbers are concrete people and their rollercoaster ride.

"I quit after I made money, but... "

A Miao men a share

I've been dabbling in the stock market since graduating in 2015, when I took $50,000 from home. These years have experienced a lot of ups and downs, such as January 4,2016, my birthday, when the a shares still have the mechanism of fusing, the same day fusing twice, that is my life's most impressive "birthday gift. ". Two days later, at 9:58 a.m. on Jan. 7, the circuit breaker triggered a direct stop to close for less than 15 minutes of full day trading, the only time a bond trader leaves work at noon. The stock market disaster lasted for a long time, but fortunately, the principal is not much, coupled with my constant bargain fill positions, the hands of the money slowly rose back.

It's normal for the stock market to go up and down, but I've never experienced anything like it this year, and now I have a big capital base, and I might have made 400,000 one day and lost 200,000 the next. Around the Spring Festival, people like riding a roller coaster, earn fast, go fast, the heart can not stand.

At first, I was a "winner" . On January 20, when Zhong Nanshan announced that new pneumonia would spread from person to person, and on January 23, when Wuhan was shut down, I wondered if the epidemic would worsen in other cities as well. So what's everybody GonNa do at home? My first thought was that it was a game, so I put a lot of stock in it. February 3 a shares opened, the first day a lot of stocks all fall limit, I bought the game stock also rose 5 points, the next day it rose limit, I sold, so made about 300,000. It was the fastest money I've made in a short time since I got into the stock market, three years'salary.

Although that period of time back and forth is very unstable, there are more than 300,000 a day to earn, and the next day fell back more than 100,000, but overall is to make money. Before I like to buy some medium-long shares, hold for a month or two, but this time I mainly take the short-term, operation down, more sometimes to earn more than a million, I made up my mind, and the boss proposed to leave, he approved. The stock market used to be my way out.

Picture / A film still of the big time

At that time, I also want to seriously learn finance, but have not had time to think of specific, the market slowly began to change. I re-opened some technology stocks, at the beginning of the other stocks fell limit, but the technology stocks did not, on the one hand is the focus of the development of the field is favored by everyone, on the other hand, also by various funds re-opened bought up. But in March, the global outbreak of the epidemic, the slowdown in consumer market growth, and the outbreak of the oil price war, capital began to sell off global assets for safe haven, causing stock markets in Europe and the United States to continue to plunge and U.S. stocks to melt down. All my eggs are in one basket, and that's what's causing my assets to shrink.

In the two weeks since tic left, I have lost not only my $1 million, but also part of my family's money. It was really emotional at the time, because I could lose it all, but not my family, because I would feel bad about it. The lowest two days, people really do not want to talk, especially afraid of being asked, very embarrassing.

I used to be very relaxed. I might not get up until ten, but now I wake up naturally at six or seven in the morning. Before going to bed to look at the foreign stock market, wake up to look again, in fact, I know that I looked also useless, but just to let oneself have a anticipation, may be and mental tension has some relationship.

I am really a bit of a panic recently, the stock market does not make money, but also will not liquidate or this time out, or believe that it will be good. Virtual currencies and options are more volatile than the stock market. They are the heartbeat, measured in minutes. Two days ago, the price of Bitcoin dropped from more than 5,000 to more than 3,000 and then rose back to 4,000 or 5,000. I saw a person who started from 40,000 and made over 200,000 in less than an hour. Of course, he lost a lot.

"Buy 10 grams of gold and keep an electronic pet. "

Coco Gold

In August of last year, I was introduced to golden money from my circle of friends. A friend who didn't seem to know how to manage his money told me that the price of gold was going up and he bought a gram. And also told me that it is very simple, directly in the small program to buy, do not need me to do anything, do not need me to use any brain. The thing about gold itself is that it's so simple, isn't it? So I bought a gram first, and then bought a gram. All told, I bought 5 grams. The price of 1 gram is about 350 yuan times 5. It cost about 2,000 yuan. I took this gold worth 2,000 yuan on a roller coaster recently.

Originally I did not pay much attention to it, I want it to become my piggy bank, always save, see when it becomes a "huge sum" , out to buy a bag. I usually love to consume, a gram of gold so buy it, can force me to save. Although I didn't have to tell my husband, I told him I wanted to buy a bag, and if he said no and I could buy it myself, then I would be twice as happy.

Recently, I have been watching it more frequently, especially near the U.S. stock market meltdown. My colleagues always talk about money management. I can't even remember the year of my son's birthday. There are no stocks and no funds. So every time my colleagues talk about this, i check out my quiet gold account.

One day, I click into the small program, found more than 100 yuan, a total of only 2,000 yuan, feel very happy. After a few days, uh, the feeling of the roller coaster was played out. One day it might have gone up more than 100, the next day it became more than 70, and now it has become more than 60. But it's all right. It's only a loss of over 100. It's no big deal. To get really involved, I also set up a reminder that gold would alert me when it was below 330, and on Monday it was below 330, so I bought another 5 grams. Sometimes I share it with my colleagues. I made $100 yesterday, $4 today. It's funny.

I don't care about the financial market, I don't understand it at all, I just feel that gold is very much like the electronic chicken I played as a child, or the traveling frog I play now, it's very static, very well behaved, it doesn't need to be cared for, and it might be a little bit higher if I go to see it once in a while, like a postcard from a frog. It was peaceful when I saw it, because it existed, and it proved that I was managing my money, which should be the norm in a mature life.

"I lost six figures at the start of the year. I feel lost. "

Bianca Wu a shares

I work in New Zealand, will put some money in the country, such as semi-regularly buy some financial management, before and after put 400,000 RMB into a shares, also care about the exchange rate... I always have some unrealistic fantasy, hope to copy the bottom.

I made money last year, but it was a tricky time, because when I saw a news report that the country was going to focus on a particular area of development, I took a big position in related stocks. The stock was a success, stable from the middle to the end of the year. When I made about 100,000 yuan less, I thought, "Oh, I can buy an Hermes. " But I didn't stop buying a bag, and I always thought I could make a little more, a little more..

A shares early in the opening of the year I have been losing, more than a month's time, first the money earned before the evaporation, to these two days directly to the loss of capital, before and after up to six figures. Actually this kind of matter, said also is own heart block, other people looks like sympathizes, but actually the innermost feelings felicitates. I only regret it. Why didn't I sell it when I was making money?

You can get away with it. I have two cell phones, one for work and one for downloading stock market and money management APPS. Before the market is good, I came home from work can not remember to look at another cell phone, so when I found that the money has been almost lost, I was still looking for domestic supplies, donated masks. Originally want to run, but the news to see the domestic epidemic to the good situation, stock trading friends also said it will rise, I still want to wait, this capital will fall... (a shares) really owe me a Hermes!

A stop loss is supposed to be a relief, like it was a dream, but when I took the money out, I felt lost, and I didn't know where to put it. I am a working people dare not compare, can only say that there is a little flexible turnover of small money, or fear of loss, simply do not dare to bear a lot of risk, I know can not afford.

Keep your money in the bank at regular intervals, and you may end up with inflation and a loss if you need to turn it around. I also have a part of the money in the financial management, last year when the good interest can have more than 200 per day, just I looked at yesterday's interest is 45. Before I also want to speculation, but "five only" after the introduction of tax is very high, meat pain.

There will still be some left over from the stock market habits, see the News said oil prices fell and thought if I buy certain to buy auto stocks, but temporarily will not re-entry. This month when the psychological imbalance can only go to see those stock market forums said losses of more than 300,000, the mood will be slightly better, can only regard those as a dream.

See a fat shop and get mad because "never bounce back. "

Foreign Exchange

I was a student of international politics, and I had a little blind confidence in the financial markets that I could anticipate a lot of problems. But my "financial accident" , is really because of self-confidence, self-confidence and collapse.

It was eight years ago that I entered the financial market as a little leek. At that time, I was still working abroad. I believed in the saying, "you don't care about your money, you don't care about your finances. " I would throw away a little bit of my salary every month, especially in the foreign exchange market, that's how you make your first fortune.

Because he is concerned about international politics, he thinks he has a good sense of what is going on and is not going to lose out. In 2018, Italy failed to form a government, a few months after the election the new government is still "difficult to produce" , Soon Italy suffered a double-homicide of debt, directly dragging down the euro trend. I remember it was a Friday, just into trading in Europe, when the euro's "cliff avalanche" against the dollar was plunging more than 100 basis points.

It was during that time that I made the wrong decision, because of the difficulties of forming a government in Italy, and the background information I thought I was familiar with, such as the popularisation of parliament, the fragmentation of political parties, the rise of Euroscepticism, etc. , i guess it had to go down. It was closed at the low point. Fortunately, the principal was not much, but the loss was also in the five figures.

Since then, I have fled the foreign exchange market, running faster than anyone else, not even caring, and my heart is less in the air, as for the money scattered in other markets, I have nothing, occasionally open is a surprise.

There was a joke about why financial markets are so short and long, because you never dream as much as you do when you're working. I was living quite a joke, see the roadside signs are followed by angry, because it wrote four words, "never rebound. ".

Some people pull me to buy Bitcoin, said sure son appreciation, I did not dare to start, because looked at a pile of information, but how do not understand. I recently asked someone who told me two months ago that I could get in at less than 7,000, to tell me to forget it and wait for 3,000. He was a voice response, obviously two years younger than me, but sigh, it seems to be able to hear old.

These two days to see the news, how much a look at the excitement is not too big sense. Even so, the little bit of the US stock I was locked into had gone from having a chance to going back eight years in one night.

"A friend came in on the 12th and was buried. "

Teacher Leng, male-american stock

I opened an account in 2016 and entered the US stock market. At that time, I was looking for a place to put some foreign currency income, and the interest rate of US dollar savings was very low, so I decided to invest in US stocks, now that adds up to about $300,000. This money is not needed immediately, so the pursuit of long-term healthy returns is like a Piggy Bank.
After the U.S. stock market meltdown, I have a friend in the 12th entry, want to copy the bottom, just in time for a consecutive week of the meltdown, must be just into the buried.
100% of these US stock market meltdowns are related to the out-of-control epidemic. Fortunately, at that time, domestic a-shares first reacted. Before the first US stock market meltdowns, I sold some long-term US stock positions according to some hot spots in a-shares at that time, they switched to pharmaceutical and telecommuting stocks, gradually adjusting a bit, and never using leverage, so the losses were not as large as the market.
U.S. stocks as a whole have been badly hurt this time, with the S & P 500 down about 33% from its peak. The stocks that I had decided to invest in, on average, were down 20%-30% , but I was able to position in time to avoid losses.
The U.S. stock market is not quite the same as the a share market, which had been growing for many years before the epidemic spread around the world. It was the kind of market that was worth investing in, and I made some money from it. But it also has its own characteristics, such as the U. S. stock AI quantitative trading more, a sudden drop will have a domino-like chain reaction. There is also a low threshold for financing and low interest rates for financing. As a result, the leverage ratio is relatively high, and the gains are magnified a lot when earning. However, in this extreme situation, the losses are also magnified. Many accounts may be forced to liquidate, causing a stampede, further exacerbating the panic.
The future is uncertain, I feel that the epidemic is not under control, the U. S. stock has not yet reached the end, may be a bit more serious than the subprime crisis, at least a few months to restore stability. I am now waiting, want to wait for the market sentiment stable time can continue to place bets.

"The heart can't take much. "

Adong male American stock + options

My portfolio includes Boeing shares, which have fallen from nearly $400 a share to a recent low of $89 over the past year. I bought them for about $132 a share in 2016, and Boeing shares have fallen below my purchase price, its market value is now unbelievably below Tesla's.

Share price chart of Boeing in the last decade. Photo / interviewees

I was a little surprised when the NYSE data stream showed a halt to trading on March 9, the first time the circuit was fused, since the last time it did so was in 1997. No one has gone through two U. S. stock market meltdowns a week, and now it has gone through a fourth.
I myself am engaged in the futures quantitative trading work, the American stock and the option is my personal hobby. When I entered the bear market in 2016, I thought the S & P 500 was reasonably priced. After three months of negative returns, my return on capital went from negative to positive. That time fell very slowly, back is also very slow, for the novice more difficult to endure, but investors did not panic. This time is completely different, these two weeks compared with 2016, can only be described as "lower, faster, stronger. ".
I was surprised at the first meltdown, but after the second one I thought it could be worse -- my account is down 14% from its peak right now, so I'll see what I can do.
I hedged and made a profit on options trading to make up some of the losses. Trading options gave me a better sense of the strong volatility. The VIX index, which measures the volatility of options, has been at its highest level in two weeks.
Originally the stock market has let me feel quite stressful, the option so high volatility let people really feel that the heart can not bear. My own recent reality: it might start at 240% , but then it's the other way around.
As things stand, many safe-haven assets are acting erratically, and even gold is down from its highs. The reason is that some funds are leveraged and require margin calls, or buy government bonds to guarantee loans. But the stock market fell liquidity problems, can not add margin when there is the risk of being liquidated. Some companies and individuals, desperate for cash, began selling other financial assets to supplement the margin. The capital markets are in a state of disarray, with no way to predict the next hour or even the next minute.

"I'm still waiting for the bottom. "

Mosquito Hong Kong stock

As the father of two children, I have been trading stocks for more than 10 years, a shares are also trading, Hong Kong stocks are also trading, but I am still mainly in Hong Kong stocks. Invest in promising companies, get a steady stream of interest and dividends, and sell them at a higher price as an economic supplement to your paycheck. I stayed in a shares, has insisted on investing in valuable companies, but it does not seem to be suitable for a shares, a better company share prices are too high, or make more money by short-term.

I sensed something was amiss the first time the stock market fused, when I discovered that a bank stock I had previously bought was foolishly falling. The bank's performance in recent years is not very good, but also not to fall from 40 dollars to 25 dollars or so, think of the problem, wait a day immediately ran away. I lost 8,000 yuan that day, if I didn't lose over 20,000 yuan.

I find that people seem to get more and more scared as they get older. They used to be young, have only one child, start their own business, and trade stocks, and want to make a living this way. But then I found that I can not do, now on the side of the home nearly 100 kilometers to work, while stocks, hope that old can buy a shop rent collection.

Can Not have no money AH, no money to be afraid of anything, afraid of old people sick, bad children, spend money in many places, are worried about others. A shares do not play clay, I do not touch, now I still have tens of thousands of Hong Kong dollars, ready to wait, when the time comes to see if we can copy the bottom in Hong Kong stocks.

Although that period of time back and forth is very unstable, there are more than 300,000 a day to earn, and the next day fell back more than 100,000, but overall is to make money. Before I like to buy some medium-long shares, hold for a month or two, but this time I mainly take the short-term, operation down, more sometimes to earn more than a million, I made up my mind, and the boss proposed to leave, he approved.

"Buy 10 grams of gold and keep an electronic pet. "

Coco Gold

In August of last year, I was introduced to golden money from my circle of friends. A friend who didn't seem to know how to manage his money told me that the price of gold was going up and he bought a gram. And also told me that it is very simple, directly in the small program to buy, do not need me to do anything, do not need me to use any brain. The thing about gold itself is that it's so simple, isn't it? So I bought a gram first, and then bought a gram. All told, I bought 5 grams. The price of 1 gram is about 350 yuan times 5. It cost about 2,000 yuan. I took this gold worth 2,000 yuan on a roller coaster recently.

Originally I did not pay much attention to it, I want it to become my piggy bank, always save, see when it becomes a "huge sum" , out to buy a bag. I usually love to consume, a gram of gold so buy it, can force me to save. Although I didn't have to tell my husband, I told him I wanted to buy a bag, and if he said no and I could buy it myself, then I would be twice as happy.

Recently, I have been watching it more frequently, especially near the U.S. stock market meltdown. My colleagues always talk about money management. I can't even remember the year of my son's birthday. There are no stocks and no funds. So every time my colleagues talk about this, i check out my quiet gold account.

One day, I click into the small program, found more than 100 yuan, a total of only 2,000 yuan, feel very happy. After a few days, uh, the feeling of the roller coaster was played out. One day it might have gone up more than 100, the next day it became more than 70, and now it has become more than 60. But it's all right. It's only a loss of over 100. It's no big deal. To get really involved, I also set up a reminder that gold would alert me when it was below 330, and on Monday it was below 330, so I bought another 5 grams. Sometimes I share it with my colleagues. I made $100 yesterday, $4 today. It's funny.

I don't care about the financial market, I don't understand it at all, I just feel that gold is very much like the electronic chicken I played as a child, or the traveling frog I play now, it's very static, very well behaved, it doesn't need to be cared for, and it might be a little bit higher if I go to see it once in a while, like a postcard from a frog.

" I would throw away a little bit of my salary every month, especially in the foreign exchange market, that's how you make your first fortune.

Because he is concerned about international politics, he thinks he has a good sense of what is going on and is not going to lose out. In 2018, Italy failed to form a government, a few months after the election the new government is still "difficult to produce" , Soon Italy suffered a double-homicide of debt, directly dragging down the euro trend. I remember it was a Friday, just into trading in Europe, when the euro's "cliff avalanche" against the dollar was plunging more than 100 basis points.

It was during that time that I made the wrong decision, because of the difficulties of forming a government in Italy, and the background information I thought I was familiar with, such as the popularisation of parliament, the fragmentation of political parties, the rise of Euroscepticism, etc. , i guess it had to go down. It was closed at the low point. Fortunately, the principal was not much, but the loss was also in the five figures.

Since then, I have fled the foreign exchange market, running faster than anyone else, not even caring, and my heart is less in the air, as for the money scattered in other markets, I have nothing, occasionally open is a surprise.

There was a joke about why financial markets are so short and long, because you never dream as much as you do when you're working. I was living quite a joke, see the roadside signs are followed by angry, because it wrote four words, "never rebound. ".

Some people pull me to buy Bitcoin, said sure son appreciation, I did not dare to start, because looked at a pile of information, but how do not understand. I recently asked someone who told me two months ago that I could get in at less than 7,000, to tell me to forget it and wait for 3,000. He was a voice response, obviously two years younger than me, but sigh, it seems to be able to hear old.

These two days to see the news, how much a look at the excitement is not too big sense. Even so, the little bit of the US stock I was locked into had gone from having a chance to going back eight years in one night.

"A friend came in on the 12th and was buried. "

Teacher Leng, male-american stock

I opened an account in 2016 and entered the US stock market. At that time, I was looking for a place to put some foreign currency income, and the interest rate of US dollar savings was very low, so I decided to invest in US stocks, now that adds up to about $300,000. This money is not needed immediately, so the pursuit of long-term healthy returns is like a Piggy Bank.
After the U.S. stock market meltdown, I have a friend in the 12th entry, want to copy the bottom, just in time for a consecutive week of the meltdown, must be just into the buried.
100% of these US stock market meltdowns are related to the out-of-control epidemic. Fortunately, at that time, domestic a-shares first reacted. Before the first US stock market meltdowns, I sold some long-term US stock positions according to some hot spots in a-shares at that time, they switched to pharmaceutical and telecommuting stocks, gradually adjusting a bit, and never using leverage, so the losses were not as large as the market.
U.S. stocks as a whole have been badly hurt this time, with the S & P 500 down about 33% from its peak. The stocks that I had decided to invest in, on average, were down 20%-30% , but I was able to position in time to avoid losses.
The U.S. stock market is not quite the same as the a share market, which had been growing for many years before the epidemic spread around the world. It was the kind of market that was worth investing in, and I made some money from it. But it also has its own characteristics, such as the U. S. stock AI quantitative trading more, a sudden drop will have a domino-like chain reaction. There is also a low threshold for financing and low interest rates for financing. As a result, the leverage ratio is relatively high, and the gains are magnified a lot when earning. However, in this extreme situation, the losses are also magnified. Many accounts may be forced to liquidate, causing a stampede, further exacerbating the panic.
The future is uncertain, I feel that the epidemic is not under control, the U. S. stock has not yet reached the end, may be a bit more serious than the subprime crisis, at least a few months to restore stability. I am now waiting, want to wait for the market sentiment stable time can continue to place bets.

"The heart can't take much. "

Adong male American stock + options

My portfolio includes Boeing shares, which have fallen from nearly $400 a share to a recent low of $89 over the past year. I bought them for about $132 a share in 2016, and Boeing shares have fallen below my purchase price, its market value is now unbelievably below Tesla's.

I was a little surprised when the NYSE data stream showed a halt to trading on March 9, the first time the circuit was fused, since the last time it did so was in 1997. No one has gone through two U. S. stock market meltdowns a week, and now it has gone through a fourth.
I myself am engaged in the futures quantitative trading work, the American stock and the option is my personal hobby. When I entered the bear market in 2016, I thought the S & P 500 was reasonably priced. After three months of negative returns, my return on capital went from negative to positive. That time fell very slowly, back is also very slow, for the novice more difficult to endure, but investors did not panic. This time is completely different, these two weeks compared with 2016, can only be described as "lower, faster, stronger. ".
I was surprised at the first meltdown, but after the second one I thought it could be worse -- my account is down 14% from its peak right now, so I'll see what I can do.
I hedged and made a profit on options trading to make up some of the losses. Trading options gave me a better sense of the strong volatility. The VIX index, which measures the volatility of options, has been at its highest level in two weeks.
Originally the stock market has let me feel quite stressful, the option so high volatility let people really feel that the heart can not bear. My own recent reality: it might start at 240% , but then it's the other way around.
As things stand, many safe-haven assets are acting erratically, and even gold is down from its highs. The reason is that some funds are leveraged and require margin calls, or buy government bonds to guarantee loans. But the stock market fell liquidity problems, can not add margin when there is the risk of being liquidated. Some companies and individuals, desperate for cash, began selling other financial assets to supplement the margin. The capital markets are in a state of disarray, with no way to predict the next hour or even the next minute.

"I'm still waiting for the bottom. "

Mosquito Hong Kong stock

As the father of two children, I have been trading stocks for more than 10 years, a shares are also trading, Hong Kong stocks are also trading, but I am still mainly in Hong Kong stocks. Invest in promising companies, get a steady stream of interest and dividends, and sell them at a higher price as an economic supplement to your paycheck. I stayed in a shares, has insisted on investing in valuable companies, but it does not seem to be suitable for a shares, a better company share prices are too high, or make more money by short-term.

I sensed something was amiss the first time the stock market fused, when I discovered that a bank stock I had previously bought was foolishly falling. The bank's performance in recent years is not very good, but also not to fall from 40 dollars to 25 dollars or so, think of the problem, wait a day immediately ran away. I lost 8,000 yuan that day, if I didn't lose over 20,000 yuan.

I find that people seem to get more and more scared as they get older. They used to be young, have only one child, start their own business, and trade stocks, and want to make a living this way. But then I found that I can not do, now on the side of the home nearly 100 kilometers to work, while stocks, hope that old can buy a shop rent collection.

Can Not have no money AH, no money to be afraid of anything, afraid of old people sick, bad children, spend money in many places, are worried about others. A shares do not play clay, I do not touch, now I still have tens of thousands of Hong Kong dollars, ready to wait, when the time comes to see if we can copy the bottom in Hong Kong stocks.

"I quit after I made money, but... "

A Miao men a share

I've been dabbling in the stock market since graduating in 2015, when I took $50,000 from home. These years have experienced a lot of ups and downs, such as January 4,2016, my birthday, when the a shares still have the mechanism of fusing, the same day fusing twice, that is my life's most impressive "birthday gift. ". Two days later, at 9:58 a.m. on Jan. 7, the circuit breaker triggered a direct stop to close for less than 15 minutes of full day trading, the only time a bond trader leaves work at noon. The stock market disaster lasted for a long time, but fortunately, the principal is not much, coupled with my constant bargain fill positions, the hands of the money slowly rose back.

It's normal for the stock market to go up and down, but I've never experienced anything like it this year, and now I have a big capital base, and I might have made 400,000 one day and lost 200,000 the next. Around the Spring Festival, people like riding a roller coaster, earn fast, go fast, the heart can not stand.

At first, I was a "winner" . On January 20, when Zhong Nanshan announced that new pneumonia would spread from person to person, and on January 23, when Wuhan was shut down, I wondered if the epidemic would worsen in other cities as well. So what's everybody GonNa do at home? My first thought was that it was a game, so I put a lot of stock in it. February 3 a shares opened, the first day a lot of stocks all fall limit, I bought the game stock also rose 5 points, the next day it rose limit, I sold, so made about 300,000. It was the fastest money I've made in a short time since I got into the stock market, three years'salary.

Although that period of time back and forth is very unstable, there are more than 300,000 a day to earn, and the next day fell back more than 100,000, but overall is to make money. Before I like to buy some medium-long shares, hold for a month or two, but this time I mainly take the short-term, operation down, more sometimes to earn more than a million, I made up my mind, and the boss proposed to leave, he approved. The stock market used to be my way out.

Picture / A film still of the big time

At that time, I also want to seriously learn finance, but have not had time to think of specific, the market slowly began to change. I re-opened some technology stocks, at the beginning of the other stocks fell limit, but the technology stocks did not, on the one hand is the focus of the development of the field is favored by everyone, on the other hand, also by various funds re-opened bought up. But in March, the global outbreak of the epidemic, the slowdown in consumer market growth, and the outbreak of the oil price war, capital began to sell off global assets for safe haven, causing stock markets in Europe and the United States to continue to plunge and U.S. stocks to melt down. All my eggs are in one basket, and that's what's causing my assets to shrink.

In the two weeks since tic left, I have lost not only my $1 million, but also part of my family's money. It was really emotional at the time, because I could lose it all, but not my family, because I would feel bad about it. The lowest two days, people really do not want to talk, especially afraid of being asked, very embarrassing.

I used to be very relaxed. I might not get up until ten, but now I wake up naturally at six or seven in the morning. Before going to bed to look at the foreign stock market, wake up to look again, in fact, I know that I looked also useless, but just to let oneself have a anticipation, may be and mental tension has some relationship.

I am really a bit of a panic recently, the stock market does not make money, but also will not liquidate or this time out, or believe that it will be good. Virtual currencies and options are more volatile than the stock market. They are the heartbeat, measured in minutes. Two days ago, the price of Bitcoin dropped from more than 5,000 to more than 3,000 and then rose back to 4,000 or 5,000. I saw a person who started from 40,000 and made over 200,000 in less than an hour. Of course, he lost a lot.

"Buy 10 grams of gold and keep an electronic pet. "

Coco Gold

In August of last year, I was introduced to golden money from my circle of friends. A friend who didn't seem to know how to manage his money told me that the price of gold was going up and he bought a gram. And also told me that it is very simple, directly in the small program to buy, do not need me to do anything, do not need me to use any brain. The thing about gold itself is that it's so simple, isn't it? So I bought a gram first, and then bought a gram. All told, I bought 5 grams. The price of 1 gram is about 350 yuan times 5. It cost about 2,000 yuan. I took this gold worth 2,000 yuan on a roller coaster recently.

Originally I did not pay much attention to it, I want it to become my piggy bank, always save, see when it becomes a "huge sum" , out to buy a bag. I usually love to consume, a gram of gold so buy it, can force me to save. Although I didn't have to tell my husband, I told him I wanted to buy a bag, and if he said no and I could buy it myself, then I would be twice as happy.

Recently, I have been watching it more frequently, especially near the U.S. stock market meltdown. My colleagues always talk about money management. I can't even remember the year of my son's birthday. There are no stocks and no funds. So every time my colleagues talk about this, i check out my quiet gold account.

One day, I click into the small program, found more than 100 yuan, a total of only 2,000 yuan, feel very happy. After a few days, uh, the feeling of the roller coaster was played out. One day it might have gone up more than 100, the next day it became more than 70, and now it has become more than 60. But it's all right. It's only a loss of over 100. It's no big deal. To get really involved, I also set up a reminder that gold would alert me when it was below 330, and on Monday it was below 330, so I bought another 5 grams. Sometimes I share it with my colleagues. I made $100 yesterday, $4 today. It's funny.

I don't care about the financial market, I don't understand it at all, I just feel that gold is very much like the electronic chicken I played as a child, or the traveling frog I play now, it's very static, very well behaved, it doesn't need to be cared for, and it might be a little bit higher if I go to see it once in a while, like a postcard from a frog. It was peaceful when I saw it, because it existed, and it proved that I was managing my money, which should be the norm in a mature life.

"I lost six figures at the start of the year. I feel lost. "

Bianca Wu a shares

I work in New Zealand, will put some money in the country, such as semi-regularly buy some financial management, before and after put 400,000 RMB into a shares, also care about the exchange rate... I always have some unrealistic fantasy, hope to copy the bottom.

I made money last year, but it was a tricky time, because when I saw a news report that the country was going to focus on a particular area of development, I took a big position in related stocks. The stock was a success, stable from the middle to the end of the year. When I made about 100,000 yuan less, I thought, "Oh, I can buy an Hermes. " But I didn't stop buying a bag, and I always thought I could make a little more, a little more..

A shares early in the opening of the year I have been losing, more than a month's time, first the money earned before the evaporation, to these two days directly to the loss of capital, before and after up to six figures. Actually this kind of matter, said also is own heart block, other people looks like sympathizes, but actually the innermost feelings felicitates. I only regret it. Why didn't I sell it when I was making money?

You can get away with it. I have two cell phones, one for work and one for downloading stock market and money management APPS. Before the market is good, I came home from work can not remember to look at another cell phone, so when I found that the money has been almost lost, I was still looking for domestic supplies, donated masks. Originally want to run, but the news to see the domestic epidemic to the good situation, stock trading friends also said it will rise, I still want to wait, this capital will fall... (a shares) really owe me a Hermes!

A stop loss is supposed to be a relief, like it was a dream, but when I took the money out, I felt lost, and I didn't know where to put it. I am a working people dare not compare, can only say that there is a little flexible turnover of small money, or fear of loss, simply do not dare to bear a lot of risk, I know can not afford.

Keep your money in the bank at regular intervals, and you may end up with inflation and a loss if you need to turn it around. I also have a part of the money in the financial management, last year when the good interest can have more than 200 per day, just I looked at yesterday's interest is 45. Before I also want to speculation, but "five only" after the introduction of tax is very high, meat pain.

There will still be some left over from the stock market habits, see the News said oil prices fell and thought if I buy certain to buy auto stocks, but temporarily will not re-entry. This month when the psychological imbalance can only go to see those stock market forums said losses of more than 300,000, the mood will be slightly better, can only regard those as a dream.

See a fat shop and get mad because "never bounce back. "

Foreign Exchange

I was a student of international politics, and I had a little blind confidence in the financial markets that I could anticipate a lot of problems. But my "financial accident" , is really because of self-confidence, self-confidence and collapse.

It was eight years ago that I entered the financial market as a little leek. At that time, I was still working abroad.
