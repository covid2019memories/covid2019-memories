Wang Sheng, who is about to graduate, has yet to find a job.

Hope originally placed in the year of the rat on the spring recruitment. When he returned home for winter vacation, Wang Sheng wanted to go back to school early to prepare for the spring recruitment. But with the outbreak and the city officially closed on January 23rd, he began to feel a bit bad.

His instinct was confirmed by the ever-increasing epidemic prevention measures. On February 1, the school opened late, and no one was allowed to return to the school ahead of time. On-site job fairs for college graduates have also been suspended.

Now, recalled before the winter vacation oneself makes two choices, Wang Sheng feels some chagrin. One, he falls behind others too much consciously, gave up take an examination of grind; the second is last autumn gave up a readily available offer.

Like Wang, there are 8.74 million new graduates, 400,000 more than last year. Some of them haven't found jobs yet. Plans to catch up with changes, the epidemic has disrupted the pace of their job search.

Out of sight, out of touch

Wang Sheng majored in applied electronics and won many scholarships. He received an offer from a new energy auto parts company at the beginning of his career, earning 6,000 yuan. This is acceptable to him as an ordinary high school student.

After he told his family, some relatives worried about "what if it is a scam subsidies, run away how to do. ". More importantly, as a Shandong native, he has been expected by his parents to find a well-organized job, "so they have face to say. ". So he decided to give up his job and take his relatives' advice to prepare for the "teacher's section" at the test technician school.

After more than two months of preparation, Wang Sheng just knew that he did not meet the requirements of the recruitment of technical school teachers. At this time the autumn recruitment has come to an end, looking at the job fair left few enterprises, Wang Sheng can only turn to the spring recruitment next year.

In addition to completing the rest of the graduation project, Wang Sheng is now the main thing every day is to visit various recruitment websites, as far as possible to search for recruitment information. School Employment Network, recruitment public number, employment wechat group, all kinds of channels to obtain recruitment information are in his search scope.

"I did not block the employment groups, and when I saw a teacher sending out a recruitment message, I quickly read it. " As long as the salary is acceptable, from the opposite major to the unlimited major, he will send his resume if he sees a position that meets the requirements, then continue to refresh and wait for a reply.

"every day is not staring at the computer is looking at the phone, my phone is mute, and now I dare not mute, for fear of missing the call. " But Day after day, in addition to the eyes often some dry, Wang Sheng has not yet waited for the results.

Zhang Xiaorou, who also graduated this year, finally received an interview notice, but in a different way.

In order to avoid people contact gathering, most recruitment companies will interview from offline to online "no contact interview. ". The process is much the same, requiring the interviewer to video-chat with the interviewer through a camera and microphone.

Affected by the epidemic, many enterprises after the recruitment to the online model. Figure / Moka analysis of 2020 enterprise recruitment affected by epidemic situation investigation

Zhang Xiaorou know different from the offline interview more attention to the overall dress and posture, video camera "can only shoot the upper body at most, " the expression and posture management has become particularly important. She often practiced her expression in the Bathroom Mirror, reciting the answers she had prepared. Sometimes she and her best friend open a video chat to simulate an interview.

She is an English major and is often asked to speak, read and write English during interviews. After turning to video interview, Zhang Xiaorou does not know whether this can carry on smoothly, "if use English to communicate when network card how to do? "

Zhang Xiaorou in the small home to move around, want to choose a suitable place to do video background. She chose in her room in front of the bookcase, but also deliberately tidied up the room to avoid the embarrassment of messy screen. But she also worries, "in case the parents are outside listening, dare not play. "

Unlike large companies with high visibility and sound process mechanism, small and medium-sized companies online recruitment is full of greater uncertainty.

Many small and medium-sized companies in the recruitment announcement of the interview link only wrote "video interview" four words, nothing else. In what way, do not know in advance, "is to download special office software, or directly with HR WITH WECHAT VIDEO? "

For Unknown Small and medium-sized companies, Zhang Xiaorou in the choice of their own considerations. When the autumn recruitment, one to the interview company downstairs, she will start to "look" company, whether convenient transportation, company size, working environment, these are Zhang Xiaorou consider factors. She believes that these can directly reflect the strength of a company and corporate culture, "some companies on the work environment is very depressing, people do not want to see. "

The most intuitive information is not available after you switch to an online interview. Zhang Xiaorou more worried is, "if the company has not been directly signed, I always feel less assured, in case is a liar how to do? "

Wang also had doubts about the online interview. He ran through several job fairs, spoke directly to recruiters and got key information quickly, "much more efficiently than asking questions on the Internet. ". Sitting at home, surmising the network line at the end of the invisible enterprises, Wang Sheng always feel some powerless.

Job Hunting mentality has changed

Lin Qiu, a finance major, was offered a job at a real estate company near the end of the fall semester. The company wanted her to go to an internship as soon as possible after the winter vacation, but she planned to send out her resume in the spring semester.

Lin Qiu does not know whether many companies have postponed spring recruitment or indeed reduced the number of posts, she felt this year some cold spring recruitment.

Because of the epidemic, there are still a large number of enterprises can not resume work on time after the Lantern Festival, the normal operation of enterprises have been affected, the need for new staff has also decreased. Lin said that although every company needs financial personnel, the demand is relatively stable, and most of the positions are due to the expansion of the company or vacancies created after employees leave the company, "Our profession has a lot to do with the economic situation, " he said. "It was already difficult to find jobs this year, but the epidemic has made it even more difficult. ". She also speculates that, because of the impact of the epidemic, people who had planned to resign after years will hesitate, and small and medium-sized enterprises do not have the idea and ability to expand further, "our profession should be relatively few jobs now, it is a bit difficult to find a job. ".

Financial Professional Lin Qiu know, after the outbreak, the production and operation of enterprises affected, but the operating costs, especially the wages of employees will not be reduced. Large enterprises can also rely on cash flow for a period of time, while the risk-resistant ability of small and medium-sized enterprises may be unable to support. Even if barely survive, it is difficult to carry out large-scale expansion in a short period of time, recruitment demand will inevitably decline.

This is exactly what Wang Sheng is worried about. He knew that although he yearned for large enterprises, it was a realistic goal to find a mature and stable small and medium-sized enterprise under his own conditions. "As long as 985 or 211 graduates from large enterprises, I may not even pass the resume. " He had to worry, the difficulties of small and medium-sized enterprises will eventually be directly transmitted to the graduates of ordinary colleges and universities like him. Of the 8.74 million new graduates, the majority are still graduates from general colleges and universities. "We have the most people and are the hardest to find jobs. "

Shi Zhuo, a film and Television Graduate Student at a Beijing University, will also graduate this summer, but he has yet to find a suitable job, and his hopes for the film industry are fading.

The film industry has borne the brunt of the outbreak, with many New Year films slated for release during the Lunar New Year holiday pulled out of cinemas and behind-the-scenes production companies. "I heard that they may cancel the spring recruitment, they are already a big company, and the situation of small companies is more predictable, " Shi said

Big firms are cutting back on hiring, while smaller ones may not survive the winter. Large Film and television production companies sometimes outsource some of their business to small and medium-sized companies to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Industry chain, small and medium-sized companies if they have not been able to get back to pay operating costs may be very easy to collapse. Shi Zhuo years ago internship in a film company has not let employees back to work, "they have nothing to do back. ".

The company that does film and Television Project formerly, now in order to survive from advertisement to small video, division Zhuo what work all began to accept. Although those are not the original want to do, but looking at the recruitment site in line with their own conditions of few companies, Shi Zhuo now feel "can make a living on the good. ".

Lin Qiu was glad he had a job to protect his cover. But the school does not open, Lin Qiu then has no place to go back to practice. Online internship is not applicable to all industries, financial work is sometimes not convenient online, "some things need to be done in-house network, and the bill is not here now. "

But every day at home added to Lin's anxiety. She heard that a tripartite agreement signed by a classmate had been unilaterally breached by the recruiting company. She has not signed the tripartite agreement, she worried that if this continues, enterprises will not be able to back out, the original job will become uncertain.

Many graduates'job-hunting mentality is also imperceptibly changing under the influence of the epidemic.

Wang Sheng no longer thinks about startups when looking at job postings. If the number of employees is too small, or the establishment time is too short, he will not consider, "do not want to go to too small company, the risk is too big. " Xiao Rou has the same worry, if the face of the emergency will be unemployed. Although the preference for more stable large enterprises, but the number of jobs is ultimately limited, ordinary colleges and universities, she faced large enterprises "more than enough" job opportunities are not too many ways, "first employment then career bar.

Civil servants are the lifeblood of many people. After the outbreak of the epidemic, many civil servants have been announced to postpone their examinations or interviews. Using this time to prepare civil servants at home is also one of their ways to ease employment anxiety. Although Wang Sheng does not agree with his parents only want him to enter the system of ideas, but "to go home to take an examination of the cause of the organization" is also a good way back for him to think.

There are lucky ones

In stark contrast to the harsh winter that has befallen most industries, some Internet industries have welcomed the spring ahead of schedule.

Zhao, who is graduating in the summer, has also been trapped by the epidemic at home, but unlike other graduates, he has been busy throughout the new year.

Before becoming an online teacher, Zhao had a career as an operations or product manager for an Internet company. After the fall, he joined an online education company as an operating intern. As early as before the outbreak, online education is the internet industry, Zhao Hai also see this point, "before the outbreak we are very short of lecturers. ".

Zhao Hai is a graduate student in a Normal University in Beijing. Although he is not a normal major, there are many students who become teachers after graduation. Although he also focuses on education, he never wanted to be a teacher. "I mainly wanted to be an internet operator, but the company told me there was a shortage of lecturers and they said I could try if I had the right degree. "

He decided to seize the opportunity. A year after signing up, the base salary is 250,000, more than most of their peers. But the pressure also comes, the various assessment criteria let has never been a teacher at the beginning of his pain, "grind the period of time is difficult, but at least it survived. "

Face the camera for tens of thousands of students before class, "grinding class" is the only way for every new teacher. Zhao Hai needs to memorize all the teaching contents by heart and, according to the teaching plan, first give the teacher a lecture, and then accept round after round of polishing, "Your class has to be dry and attractive, or why else would people choose you? " He said, still nervous before a live broadcast. "We're live. If we're wrong, we're wrong. We can't edit. "

Compared with other unemployed graduates, Zhao is undoubtedly lucky. Some media have described online education during the outbreak as if it were undergoing a "great leap forward. ". Stranded students and parents are looking for courses they can take online, and his company is investing heavily in offering low cost courses to attract students and parents, as well as recruiting new lead teachers. He sees this as an opportunity for online education, a promising industry that won't take off quickly. "right now it's more about nurturing parents' ideas about online education, " he says. "It's about the future. "

And it's not just online education. There are opportunities in the online industry to fill people's free time at home. He thought the outbreak would allow him to rest at home for a few more days. Years ago, he took an internship in the product operation of an Internet Entertainment Company. "I started my online internship after the seventh day of the seventh lunar month. ".

GARCH's job is to increase user activity on the product. To take advantage of this time when people are bored at home, he works longer hours at home than at the office. "It's high time, busier than ever. "

Though he has yet to get a formal offer, he believes the Internet industry will not be affected by the outbreak and "may even expand" . He follows Internet job listings on a daily basis, "many of which are entertainment-related" .

Trapped at home, Wang Sheng posts online to relieve his anxiety. In a post encouraging him, "I think you're already pretty good, but your luck hasn't arrived yet. " Looking back at this somewhat unsuccessful job-hunting season, he also began to let go, hoping the epidemic would pass and everything would be back on track.

Affected by the epidemic, many enterprises after the recruitment to the online model. Figure / Moka analysis of 2020 enterprise recruitment affected by epidemic situation investigation

Zhang Xiaorou know different from the offline interview more attention to the overall dress and posture, video camera "can only shoot the upper body at most, " the expression and posture management has become particularly important. She often practiced her expression in the Bathroom Mirror, reciting the answers she had prepared. Sometimes she and her best friend open a video chat to simulate an interview.

She is an English major and is often asked to speak, read and write English during interviews. After turning to video interview, Zhang Xiaorou does not know whether this can carry on smoothly, "if use English to communicate when network card how to do? "

Zhang Xiaorou in the small home to move around, want to choose a suitable place to do video background. She chose in her room in front of the bookcase, but also deliberately tidied up the room to avoid the embarrassment of messy screen. But she also worries, "in case the parents are outside listening, dare not play. "

Unlike large companies with high visibility and sound process mechanism, small and medium-sized companies online recruitment is full of greater uncertainty.

Many small and medium-sized companies in the recruitment announcement of the interview link only wrote "video interview" four words, nothing else. In what way, do not know in advance, "is to download special office software, or directly with HR WITH WECHAT VIDEO? "

For Unknown Small and medium-sized companies, Zhang Xiaorou in the choice of their own considerations. When the autumn recruitment, one to the interview company downstairs, she will start to "look" company, whether convenient transportation, company size, working environment, these are Zhang Xiaorou consider factors. She believes that these can directly reflect the strength of a company and corporate culture, "some companies on the work environment is very depressing, people do not want to see. "

The most intuitive information is not available after you switch to an online interview. Zhang Xiaorou more worried is, "if the company has not been directly signed, I always feel less assured, in case is a liar how to do? "

Wang also had doubts about the online interview. He ran through several job fairs, spoke directly to recruiters and got key information quickly, "much more efficiently than asking questions on the Internet. ". Sitting at home, surmising the network line at the end of the invisible enterprises, Wang Sheng always feel some powerless.

Wang Sheng majored in applied electronics and won many scholarships. He received an offer from a new energy auto parts company at the beginning of his career, earning 6,000 yuan. This is acceptable to him as an ordinary high school student.

After he told his family, some relatives worried about "what if it is a scam subsidies, run away how to do. ". More importantly, as a Shandong native, he has been expected by his parents to find a well-organized job, "so they have face to say. ". So he decided to give up his job and take his relatives' advice to prepare for the "teacher's section" at the test technician school.

After more than two months of preparation, Wang Sheng just knew that he did not meet the requirements of the recruitment of technical school teachers. At this time the autumn recruitment has come to an end, looking at the job fair left few enterprises, Wang Sheng can only turn to the spring recruitment next year.

In addition to completing the rest of the graduation project, Wang Sheng is now the main thing every day is to visit various recruitment websites, as far as possible to search for recruitment information. School Employment Network, recruitment public number, employment wechat group, all kinds of channels to obtain recruitment information are in his search scope.

"I did not block the employment groups, and when I saw a teacher sending out a recruitment message, I quickly read it. " As long as the salary is acceptable, from the opposite major to the unlimited major, he will send his resume if he sees a position that meets the requirements, then continue to refresh and wait for a reply.

"every day is not staring at the computer is looking at the phone, my phone is mute, and now I dare not mute, for fear of missing the call. " But Day after day, in addition to the eyes often some dry, Wang Sheng has not yet waited for the results.

Zhang Xiaorou, who also graduated this year, finally received an interview notice, but in a different way.

Job Hunting mentality has changed

Lin Qiu, a finance major, was offered a job at a real estate company near the end of the fall semester. The company wanted her to go to an internship as soon as possible after the winter vacation, but she planned to send out her resume in the spring semester.

Lin Qiu does not know whether many companies have postponed spring recruitment or indeed reduced the number of posts, she felt this year some cold spring recruitment.

Because of the epidemic, there are still a large number of enterprises can not resume work on time after the Lantern Festival, the normal operation of enterprises have been affected, the need for new staff has also decreased. Lin said that although every company needs financial personnel, the demand is relatively stable, and most of the positions are due to the expansion of the company or vacancies created after employees leave the company, "Our profession has a lot to do with the economic situation, " he said. "It was already difficult to find jobs this year, but the epidemic has made it even more difficult. ". She also speculates that, because of the impact of the epidemic, people who had planned to resign after years will hesitate, and small and medium-sized enterprises do not have the idea and ability to expand further, "our profession should be relatively few jobs now, it is a bit difficult to find a job. ".

Financial Professional Lin Qiu know, after the outbreak, the production and operation of enterprises affected, but the operating costs, especially the wages of employees will not be reduced. Large enterprises can also rely on cash flow for a period of time, while the risk-resistant ability of small and medium-sized enterprises may be unable to support. Even if barely survive, it is difficult to carry out large-scale expansion in a short period of time, recruitment demand will inevitably decline.

This is exactly what Wang Sheng is worried about. He knew that although he yearned for large enterprises, it was a realistic goal to find a mature and stable small and medium-sized enterprise under his own conditions. "As long as 985 or 211 graduates from large enterprises, I may not even pass the resume. " He had to worry, the difficulties of small and medium-sized enterprises will eventually be directly transmitted to the graduates of ordinary colleges and universities like him. Of the 8.74 million new graduates, the majority are still graduates from general colleges and universities. "We have the most people and are the hardest to find jobs. "

Shi Zhuo, a film and Television Graduate Student at a Beijing University, will also graduate this summer, but he has yet to find a suitable job, and his hopes for the film industry are fading.

The film industry has borne the brunt of the outbreak, with many New Year films slated for release during the Lunar New Year holiday pulled out of cinemas and behind-the-scenes production companies. "I heard that they may cancel the spring recruitment, they are already a big company, and the situation of small companies is more predictable, " Shi said

Big firms are cutting back on hiring, while smaller ones may not survive the winter. Large Film and television production companies sometimes outsource some of their business to small and medium-sized companies to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Industry chain, small and medium-sized companies if they have not been able to get back to pay operating costs may be very easy to collapse. Shi Zhuo years ago internship in a film company has not let employees back to work, "they have nothing to do back. ".

The company that does film and Television Project formerly, now in order to survive from advertisement to small video, division Zhuo what work all began to accept. Although those are not the original want to do, but looking at the recruitment site in line with their own conditions of few companies, Shi Zhuo now feel "can make a living on the good. ".

Lin Qiu was glad he had a job to protect his cover. But the school does not open, Lin Qiu then has no place to go back to practice. Online internship is not applicable to all industries, financial work is sometimes not convenient online, "some things need to be done in-house network, and the bill is not here now. "

But every day at home added to Lin's anxiety. She heard that a tripartite agreement signed by a classmate had been unilaterally breached by the recruiting company. She has not signed the tripartite agreement, she worried that if this continues, enterprises will not be able to back out, the original job will become uncertain.

Many graduates'job-hunting mentality is also imperceptibly changing under the influence of the epidemic.

Wang Sheng no longer thinks about startups when looking at job postings. If the number of employees is too small, or the establishment time is too short, he will not consider, "do not want to go to too small company, the risk is too big. " Xiao Rou has the same worry, if the face of the emergency will be unemployed. Although the preference for more stable large enterprises, but the number of jobs is ultimately limited, ordinary colleges and universities, she faced large enterprises "more than enough" job opportunities are not too many ways, "first employment then career bar.

Civil servants are the lifeblood of many people. After the outbreak of the epidemic, many civil servants have been announced to postpone their examinations or interviews. Using this time to prepare civil servants at home is also one of their ways to ease employment anxiety. Although Wang Sheng does not agree with his parents only want him to enter the system of ideas, but "to go home to take an examination of the cause of the organization" is also a good way back for him to think.

There are lucky ones

In stark contrast to the harsh winter that has befallen most industries, some Internet industries have welcomed the spring ahead of schedule.

Zhao, who is graduating in the summer, has also been trapped by the epidemic at home, but unlike other graduates, he has been busy throughout the new year.

Before becoming an online teacher, Zhao had a career as an operations or product manager for an Internet company. After the fall, he joined an online education company as an operating intern. As early as before the outbreak, online education is the internet industry, Zhao Hai also see this point, "before the outbreak we are very short of lecturers. ".

Zhao Hai is a graduate student in a Normal University in Beijing. Although he is not a normal major, there are many students who become teachers after graduation. Although he also focuses on education, he never wanted to be a teacher. "I mainly wanted to be an internet operator, but the company told me there was a shortage of lecturers and they said I could try if I had the right degree. "

He decided to seize the opportunity. A year after signing up, the base salary is 250,000, more than most of their peers. But the pressure also comes, the various assessment criteria let has never been a teacher at the beginning of his pain, "grind the period of time is difficult, but at least it survived. "

Face the camera for tens of thousands of students before class, "grinding class" is the only way for every new teacher. Zhao Hai needs to memorize all the teaching contents by heart and, according to the teaching plan, first give the teacher a lecture, and then accept round after round of polishing, "Your class has to be dry and attractive, or why else would people choose you? " He said, still nervous before a live broadcast. "We're live. If we're wrong, we're wrong. We can't edit. "

Compared with other unemployed graduates, Zhao is undoubtedly lucky. Some media have described online education during the outbreak as if it were undergoing a "great leap forward. ". Stranded students and parents are looking for courses they can take online, and his company is investing heavily in offering low cost courses to attract students and parents, as well as recruiting new lead teachers. He sees this as an opportunity for online education, a promising industry that won't take off quickly. "right now it's more about nurturing parents' ideas about online education, " he says. "It's about the future. "

And it's not just online education. There are opportunities in the online industry to fill people's free time at home. He thought the outbreak would allow him to rest at home for a few more days. Years ago, he took an internship in the product operation of an Internet Entertainment Company. "I started my online internship after the seventh day of the seventh lunar month. ".

GARCH's job is to increase user activity on the product. To take advantage of this time when people are bored at home, he works longer hours at home than at the office. "It's high time, busier than ever. "

Though he has yet to get a formal offer, he believes the Internet industry will not be affected by the outbreak and "may even expand" . He follows Internet job listings on a daily basis, "many of which are entertainment-related" .

Trapped at home, Wang Sheng posts online to relieve his anxiety. In a post encouraging him, "I think you're already pretty good, but your luck hasn't arrived yet. " Looking back at this somewhat unsuccessful job-hunting season, he also began to let go, hoping the epidemic would pass and everything would be back on track.
