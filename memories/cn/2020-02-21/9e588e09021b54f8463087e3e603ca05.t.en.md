Introduction to behindmylife

2020.2.21

A month passed so, tens of millions of large cities in the central, said Feng Feng Feng, even today, still feel a bit incredible. I jinxed it, and the resumption of work in Hubei Province was pushed back another half month, to March 10, and my mood fluctuated from thinking my mother was joking, to not believing the news was true, to a speechless rage. I have never been so eager to work on a project. Although we haven't got the approval documents from the Management Committee for the project, according to the latest notification from Xi'an, the full resumption of work is coming, and the approval is in the near future.

Headquarters originally scheduled a briefing this morning, to tomorrow morning, headquarters staff to the Optical Valley Conference Room, other regional video link, I wonder how headquarters break through the layers of blockade to run to the optical valley to work, at least our community does not recognize the ordinary resumption of work certificate, and the road traffic police disk check strict, now medical workers need to apply for epidemic proof + Work Proof two documents. I was joking with my friends last night. Did my colleagues at headquarters hold it too long? They need to stretch their muscles, exercise and ride a shared bike to a meeting.

It seems that I have been angry all the time recently. The delay in returning to work in the province is not particularly surprising. The community is strictly controlled, public transport is shut down, and residents can not travel, so there is no normal commuting. The epidemic is not under effective control, the official figures are improving, but with a large base and many unforeseen factors, even if all districts are now "thoroughly checked and the numbers cleared, " there is no guarantee that there will be no new cases in the next 10 days.

I just feel angry that the cost for ordinary people to control the epidemic is too high. I don't know about other residents. As far as I am concerned, I am working in other places. I am only going home for the New Year. The work in other places has started gradually. The employees are returning to their units one after another, and I am still stuck in Wuhan, despite being able to work remotely, communicating with colleagues on Wechat is still not as easy as in person. In addition, a lot of important information was stored on the desktop in the project office, and due to the confidentiality of the information, it was difficult for me to give the password to my other colleagues on the project (we were not in the same organization) .

The laptop I brought home on the 2nd day of the 20th century broke down and couldn't find a place to repair it. I called Apple Customer Service and asked me to make an appointment to check the hardware at the genius bar. After the city was sealed, there was no place to repair it, not only affect office efficiency, personal life entertainment also greatly affected, every day with a mobile phone wandering at home.

Cats are still in the pet hospital foster care, foster care for more than a month, at least another month, cat food I can Taobao direct mail orders, but still no less than a fixed daily foster care expenses. Not to mention the cat in the cage for a long time, activities are limited, only a fixed more than 10 minutes can be released from the cage, I now can not bear to point to open the hospital from the small video, feel very guilty, feel sorry for the cat.

In addition, the landlord will urge me to pay the second quarter rent in March, and I will not stay for a few days in the first quarter. In the second quarter, I will continue to "provide for an empty house. " Upon my return to Xi'an, according to the requirements, Hubei residents will be under concentrated isolation for 15 days, each district designated Hotel Hotel, I rent the community clearly do not accept foreigners (especially Hubei Identity Card tenants) , then I have to pay for their own hotel, their own solution during the isolation of food life. One of my colleagues returned to Xi'an from Guangzhou. He was reluctant to pay for a hotel room. He talked on the phone with the property for nearly three hours. He brazenly returned to the community. After returning home, the door was immediately sealed. The property issued a thermometer and asked him not to leave the house, report your temperature and health in the morning and evening. Colleagues feel lucky to be prepared, luggage is full of food, Rice and flour reserve sufficient, otherwise really at home to starve to death.

Sealing the city to eat life is not convenient, such as to buy food plus more than a dozen wechat group, set up an alarm clock in the evening to grab food, such as hungry Meituan take turns to brush, see which shops open in stock. On the one hand, they said that they would strictly control prices and fight against shopkeepers and sellers who raised prices during the epidemic. On the other hand, people in Wuhan had no choice but to accept expensive and outrageous packages, which were 30% to 50% higher than the usual retail prices. In special periods, if they did not accept the package purchase, they would not eat, the price goes up, but the quality is shoddy, chilling. My friend community organized a fruit group, she bought five Jins of strawberry cream, I said I also like to eat strawberries, if delicious I sent to our community group. She angrily sent me a picture last night, saying that outside a circle of strawberries looked big and red, and inside there were many rotten and moldy fruits. She picked and picked and lost half a pot. Many residents in the community were not satisfied with the fruit bought by the group. There was no place to complain, there's not even a platform for bad reviews.

I brush micro-blog also see the complaints of the same city, community owners questioned the package is too expensive, the property is not receiving a rebate, the property directly replied "after the delivery of food not sent to the owner of the whole building" ..

All of this is part of the price that ordinary people pay to control the epidemic, despite the psychological trauma that takes a long time to digest. All losses can only be swallowed back in the stomach to admit their bad luck, can not find the way and responsible person to demand compensation, or even can not mention compensation, otherwise they will be labeled as "selfish" , "obstinate people" , "no overall view. " However, it is the reasonable claim and right of common people to demand normal life order. All move toward collectivization,"individual"disappear slowly, must obey to arrange, must obey a regulation. The collective is made up of individual people, but in the end the collective devours the individual and uses the big self to wrap up the small self. Why not call me angry.

Every time I write an epidemic diary, I tell myself, write more positive energy, what recently happened to be happy things, and finally turned into a bitter water. To give today's diary a grudging happy ending, I'd go on to recommend:

- The latest issue of the Surplus value is very well worth listening to. The text version is available on the website and can be downloaded. It is recommended to read the text version

- The two-issue inventory of the "unroll" update is also very good;

- "Gender Trouble" by Judith Butler will be featured in three issues of "The Partially Examined Life" ;

- The second season of "my genius girlfriend" has started and now has four episodes;

- A Japanese blogger named Choki lives with two cats and a rabbit on youtube. He updates his daily routine every week. The video is gentle and healing, and when he's anxious, he clicks on it and misses my cat more

- Wang ming-an's book is again recommended, and his theory of "body and space during SARS" : "The social nature retreated sharply to individuality, so that the family became a self-contained enclosed space, an absolute space for the individual... the family began to discard all emotion and romantic mythology, it was not a lingering atmosphere created by lights, music, flowers, whispers and guests. It becomes a body protective wall... people hide in the home, not for the gradual thinning of the blood ethics repeated review, but for this geometric space over and over again its patient examination... some of the special places of the family space, especially those closely related to the body of the place Foshan Foshan Toilet, window, door handle, shoe cabinet has been exquisite reflection, people will look patiently touch every hidden corner of this space. The members of the family from the social stage, no matter what position he occupied in the society, became the diligent cleaners after he returned from the stage. It is as much about cleaning one's body as it is about cleaning one's space: One scrubs one's hands indefatigably and carefully. The double cleanness of body and space becomes the most necessary and daily work. The great poetry of the family was destroyed by a tedious decontamination effort. A national clean-up campaign for the body and its space has spontaneously become a grand theme in life",
And, "this is a city of few people, but a city of information; people are forced to hold on to one part of the city, but they know the whole city. The spatial isolation of the body connects people together as never before, and the individual atomic bodies weave together an astonishing sense of identity: they follow the same thing, watch the same news, talk about the same subject, send the same message, take the same medicine, and even perform the same physical act: hand washing. People can no longer see each other, but they can share with each other similar replicas. No community can be found so full of paradox: a community of isolation, dispersion and non-communication. People can not see the grand assembly in the square, but there is still a tight focus to keep people together. Hidden people, but in a common moment, together thump heartbeat

- "An asteroid fell in the afternoon" by Shen Dacheng, mentioned in her diary before, saw her interview yesterday, mentioned that "Miss box-man" bears a striking resemblance to the current epidemic, and the short story "Miss box-man" If you look outside the context of the pneumonia epidemic, I admire the ingenuity and writing. Her interview, i picked out a few paragraphs that poked me: "people are like this, it is absurd, as long as the repetition of three or five times to accept that is normal things... barbaric expansion, and ultimately will hurt themselves... if spray disinfection, blood test, wet air can bear, can not bear is the difference. ".

Yesterday I saw a word on Weibo, "Chun no an an" is the mysterious and mysterious language of Japanese literature, not referring to the real darkness, but the thin, weak light, faint fragrance of the air in the spring night. Recently, the sun has been setting more and more late, and you can still see the sporadic setting sun from the window after 6 o'clock. The spring night always feels like a mottled light. The dialect is "not completely dark" , like a sheet of dark glass covering the day, the background color is still bright and light.

Finally, share a passage from Marguerite Duras's the quiet life: All of a sudden, the trees bloom, the August flowers bloom... the woods, the plains, the mulberries, the heated cliffs, standing still in a state of supernatural amazement, and nine or 12 months are in the making. A putrid smell rose from bigg's ditch. It was August, and it contained the smells of the year. I'm nobody. I have no name, no face. In August, I was... nothing. I walked in silence, with nothing to show my existence, and nothing to do with me, and from the bottom of the stream came the croaking of frogs, the leaping frogs, who had learned of August, of death.
