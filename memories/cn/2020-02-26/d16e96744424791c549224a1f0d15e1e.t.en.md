##A rookie reporter's winter vacation diary

Micro signal

Function, my spiritual garden, welcome to visit, also hope to become your spiritual garden

Write in the Front:
At 7:30 on January 22, I woke up, turned on my mobile phone and saw a message from reporter L: "I went to Wuhan to cover the coronavirus. Do you have any interest in the rear support? "
The first feeling is hard to describe, a bit like "Khan big point soldiers, roll roll has a Ye Ming" (?) . My days of fishing are over, and I'm about to start touching history. It's amazing to think that, less than two months ago, I was in Singapore, enjoying my last foreign leisure, reading, swimming and working out every day. Take the bus to see Singapore's clean, beautiful street scene, the endless summer long.
On the afternoon of December 3, while waiting for a flight home from Singapore Changi Airport, it occurred to me that I might as well take an internship at a newspaper. Four months of solitary life in Singapore, of closed reading and exercise, made me feel more empty, closed, and cowardly than I had ever felt before, and it was the process of resistance and reconstruction that brought me back to my high spirits. That afternoon at the airport, I suddenly wanted to leave the stack of books to do something. Now I think it is the double growth of body and spirit that leads me to the place I must arrive. But who would have thought such an event would have occurred?

In the morning, I saw a link to a request for help from some family members of the patients on Weibo. Most of these patients had viral infections on CT scans that ruled out swine flu, swine flu, and other possible causes, most likely new pneumonia, but could not be diagnosed or treated. The family's last resort is to tweet for help. This reflects at least two messages: 1. Hospital beds have been severely overloaded, and this is by no means the result of a sudden occurrence in recent days; 2. A large number of critically ill patients remain undiagnosed and unable to be hospitalized. The official count at the time was 440.
Spent the day tweeting to the families of the patients who were asking for help. Most of them ignore me, understandably. One family member attracted the attention of a certain department by asking for help through Weibo. After the problem of hospitalization was properly solved, he did not want to be exposed any more. That's understandable. For the family, saving lives is important. All that empty public value is no match for the misery at hand.
And I'm glad they're well taken care of. But at the same time there is a lingering shadow: They micro-blog for help, loud enough to attract the attention of Yousi, through the immediate difficulties. But what about the silent ones? What about those who suffer in silence? With limited beds, one suffering is solved, and one suffering is lost. Was it the voice of the one who measured the severity of the suffering and determined the priority of treatment?
This is the truth that we have always seen in public opinion. Small things, big things is the basic maintenance of stability posture, so make things become a magic weapon in the face of injustice. When will this distorted mechanism of public opinion be eliminated? Why are we still unable to achieve justice through the normal, stable mechanism, still have to rely on outside of the regular complaint to seek justice? The ancient people beat the drum, today's citizens micro-blog help, change only the means of technology. Still can not get rid of, is to the worship of the Blue Sky Big Lord, "asks the heaven to give the slave master" .
When push comes to shove, we rely so heavily on public opinion. But the power of our supervision of public opinion is so inevitably weak. At the same time, we have to constantly face public alert and criticism. Aren't "rumors" , "unscrupulous media" and "foreign forces" our most common slogan? Ask yourself if these slogans are disciplining you and me as apathetic spectators, being very critical of the speakers, and believing in the one voice?
In the afternoon, a patient with mild illness was picked up on Douban. He said the fever clinic was full. And stay in Wuhan Friends Chat, he said Wuhan medical staff infection is not optimistic.

Early in the morning, great changes in the wind and clouds, Wuhan announced the closure of the city. When he woke up, he went to the restaurant and mumbled to his parents, "the city is closed, the city is closed. ". The air was so quiet, the house so empty, it didn't even sound like my own.
To see the elder sister in the ticket circle issued a large paragraph of the text, there is such a sentence: "these (reporter) seniors, in full awareness of the severity of the situation, stay, Farewell, and then stay in the city has long been paralyzed, and unknown virus, waiting for closure. ".
Guan Yi was pushed to the top of the storm because of an article by Caixin, Professor Guan Yi predicted that the number of new crowns would be 10 times that of SARS, which probably aroused the hatred of some people who hid their ears and stole the Bell, plus the word "deserter" in the article, it is a reminder of the extreme nationalism and regional rifts triggered by last year's events in Hong Kong. Stirred up by a few articles written by a thoughtful person, the misplaced national sentiment and the mobilization of the statism have been mixed up, triggering a new wave of public opinion storm. Academics are not immune, truth tellers are vilified, suffering forgotten, and only the statism's sense of self is left in the torrent of public opinion.
Note: Professor Guan Yi has been vindicated recently. His prediction is not only correct, but now it seems to be conservative. The number of infected people is more than ten times that of SARS? But public opinion field everyone forget things, when the battle is very big, but few people pay attention to rehabilitation. How can a voice not be cold?
In the afternoon, a classmate came to me, complaining about the lack of measures to deal with the new type of coronary pneumonia in the county. Henan, a neighboring province, has made a big show of fighting the epidemic, even turning itself into an Internet celebrity. Although our city has no cases yet, it has officially issued some notices, except that the people in the county seem to be living in a greenhouse, unaware of what's going on outside, no one on the street is wearing a mask.
Although in the internship, as if to help a little, but I also know that their own Wuhan, can do very limited. A few friends a discussion, so decided to start from close, and the county to communicate, see if the county media platform can do some publicity, attract the attention of people around.
So I started trying to contact the county. Ask a student intern to contact a publicist. The other side said: "No reporting" , "for fear of causing panic. ".
There's nothing to say. Was Such talk unfamiliar in the early days of the epidemic? Some people wait for instructions, for notifications. Up-and-down prevarication, no initiative and enthusiasm. He's a good boy. Most of the time numb to muddle along, only prevarication time is very active.
"Avoid Panic" has always been the excuse to prevaricate, but in fact, "panic" is a large part of the reason for the non-transparent information. In a life-threatening event like the plague, where vital information almost always comes first from the people, how can it not be scary? How can there be trust? You always say you have to trust the authorities. Can the authorities trust the people? Believe that with the courage to face the Truth and disclose information, people can not panic?

We finally picked up a family member this afternoon. The interview was a bumpy ride. I got in touch with her the day before yesterday, but she is seeing a doctor with her mother and asked me to interview her yesterday. But yesterday afternoon her mother suddenly deteriorated and rushed to the Red Cross Hospital, so that the interview was postponed again.
Seeing a doctor in Wuhan these days is peripatetic, often line up for hours at a time to get a shot. There is no isolation environment, but also the fear of being infected, crowded patients suffer, the atmosphere must be depressed heavy.
After the city was sealed off, they decided to stay home so they could give me an interview. After the interview mixed feelings, confirmed the impression of these days, large hospitals are full, cross-infection is impossible to avoid, the outbreak has long been. It's harder to diagnose, harder to admit.
While waiting for treatment, she said, one patient said, "do you have to boil people to death? " Another family came in with a fever, and the nurse sighed, "this one is too hard. " All the patients were exhausted, the most common thing the family members of the patients said during the interview was "people are numb. ". Today is the New Year's Eve festival, she said: "There is no taste of the year. ". I do not know how many compatriots in Wuhan, is not a taste of the New Year's Eve. At this time how can happy New Year, how can whitewash peace?
The interview ended at a little after 6:00 p.m. , just in time for dinner, and then the family waited to watch the Spring Festival gala. Emotions are contagious, and fear, worry, and pain can linger over the phone. Absent-minded at dinner. I can't watch the gala anymore.
A person went to another room, the next door Spring Festival festival festival gala noise still from time to time through the wall, Yue Yunpeng probably in the talk of no content of the cross talk, sound like Jia Ling also appeared, are old faces. With all the suffering going on, why does it seem like it's business as usual?
I just think the Spring Festival gala is noisy, because human joys and sorrows can be interlinked.

From the day before yesterday, many patients on the ticket circle self-described type of reports, most of the writing of the moving, but there is nothing new, to this day, has felt a bit excessive. There is no disputing the fact that medical supplies are in short supply, beds are in short supply, diagnosis is difficult, suffering is deep, and the situation is critical. Consuming emotions over and over again doesn't help, and requires some deeper reflection.
Reading the plague the other day, history repeats itself. Official support for the big, the People's contempt, superstitious confusion seems to occur today. EXCERPT:
"But he knows that this documentary is not going to be a decisive victory. It is but a testimony of what had to be done, and what must be done in the future, when the god of terror reappears with his merciless butcher's knife, by those who can not be saints, who can not be reconciled to the tyranny of disaster, who set aside their own sufferings, and who only want to be doctors."
January 26,2020
Get up this morning, it snowed, hurried back to the county from home. County also began to respond to the new type of coronary pneumonia, the official intervention, the people of a sudden more alert. I think it's very credible... It works better than a normal person ...... Grandma and aunt's village was closed, but grandma and GRANDPA's village had not been closed, and everyone was still making their normal visits, and no one had come to warn them that it was too dangerous, and the village and town cadres were incompetent.

The days began on Dec. 8, when the first patient became ill, and ended on Jan. 20, when Zhong Nanshan spoke. It's obviously a bit late in the game to get this far, but where is it stuck?
According to the Health Commission's website, the first official notification was on 12.31, with 27 cases reported, up until 5 January, with no update on the epidemic from 6 January to 10 January, and from 12 January to 17 January, the numbers didn't go up. That said, from Jan. 5 to Jan. 17, the official notification of the outbreak virtually ground to a halt. As of January 19, the National Health Commission said experts had determined that the outbreak was "preventable and controllable. ".
Meanwhile, Hong Kong activated its "serious" response level as early as January 4, and other countries began reporting cases in mid-january.
Regarding the hospital, according to an interview with the director of the Department of gastroenterology of Wuhan Fifth Hospital by the China Youth Daily, on December 25, she had heard of medical workers suffering from pneumonia of unknown cause (interestingly, no infection was found among the staff, according to a Jan. 11 announcement from the Wuhan Health Commission) , and on January 3, the Fifth Hospital began viral pneumonia training, a number of suspected cases were reported on the 6th, and the emergency and respiratory wards were full in October, "two-thirds of which are estimated to be viral pneumonia" . Similarly, information from other sources can also confirm that many hospitals in Wuhan have already seen a large number of patients with fever around January 10, and bed resources have been strained. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that between early January and mid-january, there has been an outbreak of the new type of coronary pneumonia. This is also consistent with the timing of the spread of the epidemic (the first wave of patients mostly started in December, with an outbreak expected in early January based on the incubation period and the onset cycle) .
At this point, official communications are at a standstill.
A similar picture emerged in the media, which reported the outbreak in early January and followed the confirmation of viral pneumonia as a new form of pneumonia around January 11. But between the 5th and the 10th, the 12th and the 17th, the media and public attention to the new pneumonia was low. A paper in the "mikey flies the plane" public number supports this conclusion by analyzing the reptiles.
Notably, the sessions in Wuhan and Hubei took place from Jan. 5 to Jan. 17, coinciding with the government's announcement that the outbreak had stalled and media attention had dropped. That can't be a coincidence.
In my country, it is almost Open Secrets to maintain social harmony during major conferences. During this time, the media will be aware of certain negative issues (such as the epidemic) , social media will also actively cooperate, launched net action. The Nadir of public opinion and the cessation of negative information were entirely predictable actions.
However, more than ten days of stagnation, is enough to make our country and people in a cunning, sinister virus in front of the loss of control of the Golden Window. The price was a heavy one. When are we gonNA stop with this phony Vanity Project? Can we avoid real disaster and damage for the sake of false prosperity and harmony?
Sorting out the data also found that Wuhan Health Committee of the epidemic notification can not be slow, can not be described as big. It was not until January 14 that the Wuhan Health Commission's seventh circular changed the expression of the epidemic from "no apparent human-to-human transmission" to "limited human-to-human transmission can not be ruled out, " based on the discovery of a family cluster in 41 cases. But in fact, on January 31, the first financial report, has been interviewed about the patients, the husband first became ill, the wife later became ill. According to the definition of "limited human transmission, " according to the report, it can already "not rule out the existence of limited human transmission. ". However, the Health Commission's confirmation is still half a month later.
According to later reports, most hospitals did realize the seriousness of the situation by early January, and the viral pneumonia was open to them at the start of the outbreak. This makes the middle of the ten days of the black box more confusing, but also more regrettable. Even the most cunning viruses have given humans a chance, but they're too busy doing something else.

The Fire God Mountain Hospital was built, and there was a post on Weibo, calling the machines at the site vomiting mud paste, forked sauce and blue forget machine. It was really fun to play with the meat, and I didn't see anyone who really reflected on the epidemic situation and showed consideration for the workers, they're really good at entertaining. In particular, some people called coronavirus a crown, is not know how many families because of this "a crown" displaced, how much suffering is taking place on the earth? How Dare You Call Me Guan?
Press: There have been media reports, Vulcan Mountain Raytheon workers infected with a new coronavirus, this may be the true project. It's not as hot as on Weibo, and it's not as cute as those cartoon machines.

The Red Cross Society was criticized on the Internet for its poor delivery of materials. Today, I read an article by southern weekend and interviewed internal staff of the Red Cross Society. Roughly speaking, the Red Cross Society does not have the power to issue materials. The power to issue materials is in the Health Commission, no approval, no distribution. We have very limited manpower, and we're overworked.
This is also typical, as the habit of listening to others and a highly centralized system can lead to such problems. As a result, the HHS does not necessarily have the energy to allocate supplies one by one, and the Red Cross, as an executive body, is accustomed to being obedient, having neither the capacity to deal with the situation nor the courage to act beyond its mandate.

Interviewed a mother and son today.
The mother's fever started on January 17th, the son's on the 21st. They were treated at Wuhan Ninth Hospital. The hospital gave nucleic acid test to all patients in the observation room on the 28th and 29th, the son is positive, the mother is negative. After that, the son was quickly admitted to the hospital, while the mother was informed several times to transfer hospital.
The saddest part is that although the son was diagnosed positive by nucleic acid, the symptoms were relatively mild, while the mother, though negative, had already developed dyspnea a week ago, which is a serious case. But transferred to the ninth floor ward for systematic treatment (which also means critical care) was the son, while the mother had to continue to languish in a crowded observation room on the fourth floor, where medical conditions and staff were inadequate, every day a patient dies of respiratory failure, and the hospital is too busy to care.
"I wish I had been positive, " the woman told me several times during the interview, after she was disqualified from the hospital after two negative nucleic acid tests. The result of a nucleic acid test sends mother and son to the ends of the Earth. Is this too rigid a way to tell patients apart?
In particular, we have always described the fight against the epidemic as a war. We have used numerous military words to describe the fight against the epidemic. We have used the entire national system to prevent and control the epidemic. War Can not be avoided without sacrifice, has this kind of hype and emphasis also resulted in many unnecessary sacrifices?
The prevention and treatment of the epidemic directly related to the territorial officials, so the treatment of positive patients will become a hard target, limited resources, negative patients have no time to take care of. Under the rigid command, under the great pressure of losing the black hat, the attention to one group of people often leads to the neglect of another group of people. Thus, mild positive cases can be treated, while severe negative cases of dyspnea are discharged.
In addition, the nucleic acid test as the only diagnostic standard, which itself has many problems. Some doctors have pointed out the uncertainty of nucleic acid testing and the need to combine it with CT clinical judgment. In Wuhan, however, nucleic acid testing is the only standard of diagnosis and treatment. However, due to limited resources, it is impossible to arrange as many tests as possible for patients as in other provinces to reduce the number of errors and missed results. Thus, a piece of paper test to determine the fate of the tragedy has occurred.
When I first took the drastic measures, I was fully expecting them to lead to our ultimate victory. But these days, sacrifices are being made, and we're not alone in seeing people go off their meds, we're seeing other patients die, we're seeing more people whose lives have been radically changed by this tragedy. Their voices had been drowned out by the heat of the war, but the pain would not go away. Is it just a woman's kindness?
T and his friend talked a lot about it, but no one could get an answer. All we knew was that it was a disaster, and the suffering in the sun and in the shadows was immense. We can not ignore the rationality of some measures under the overall situation of epidemic prevention, but neither can we ignore the Poker Face of suffering. It was a disaster.
According to: The interview of a mother and son, the Son has been discharged from the hospital, the mother has been transferred to the hospital on the 14th. The operation of the Shelter Hospital and the change of the diagnosis and treatment have played a key role in the alleviation of the situation.

T reporter's report "who is the "false negative" new type of coronary pneumonia patients, " issued, the response is Great.
Many doctors, experts have confirmed that there may be uncertainty in nucleic acid testing, clinical cases also highlighted this point. In contrast, the diagnosis and treatment of SARS in CT clinical diagnosis and confirmed diagnosis of nucleic acid is a level, this new pneumonia diagnosis and treatment of only one nucleic acid, appears to be more stringent.
When medical resources in other provinces are sufficient, it is reasonable to focus on nucleic acid testing, but Hubei, especially Wuhan, is very tight. If only nucleic acid testing is used as the sole criterion, there will be a lot of "false negative" patients can not be treated, or even because of not doing a good job of isolation and infection to others, the risk is great.
A number of media outlets have joined forces to raise the issue of nucleic acid testing, and official policies and treatment plans have quickly changed. In the fifth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan, the diagnostic criteria of suspected cases were relaxed separately for Hubei Province, and CT clinical diagnosis was added.

Dr. Lee WL is dead. The Nation Mourns.
Rationally speaking, on a factual level, there are some parts of Dr. Lee's story that are narrated. For example, Dr. Li's early warning in the group was on December 31, and according to my previous combing, the Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission had already notified the Community of the outbreak on that day. In addition, according to a report by the Changjiang daily in an interview with Dr. Zhang Jixian of Xinhua Hospital in Hubei Province, as early as December 27, Dr. Zhang Jixian has already notified his superiors to report the viral pneumonia situation to the Jiang'an District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan. These circumstances suggest that the reporting channel remained open at the outset of the outbreak. The critical time for things to go bad is between January 5th and January 20th.
But so what? We should see public anger. Dr. Li is a symbol, his experience is also too suitable to become a symbol, whistle-blower was admonished, and eventually died of new crown pneumonia, "for the people pay, frozen in the snow. ".
We can not allow Dr. Lee to be mythologized again as a hero, to be celebrated, and then forgotten in a celebrated way. He is a human being just like us, and just as ordinary as he is, let each of us equally ordinary, equally likely at some point to encounter injustice, want to do the right thing and often feel powerless, ordinary people feel empathy. We pray for him and his family, for an ordinary person who still has a sense of justice and love, for people who are used to silence to stop being silent, to stop repressing the anger that has been pent up for so long. The anger of those who have long controlled public opinion, the disgust of the crime of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble" , the anger of the cover-up and suppression in the early stages of the epidemic, the anger of the unrestrained myth of sacrifice.
We should remember this morning's outrage as a human being who suffered injustice, not as a fallen hero. Remember the reason behind the tragedy. Don't let your anger go to waste.
Note: On the night of Dr. Li Wenliang's death, many citizens spontaneously turned on their flashlights and shot their whistles into the sky, echoing through the night sky of Wuhan. Countless ordinary people used it to honor the departure of another ordinary person, and the beams and whistles symbolized the empathy of countless ordinary people. Isn't it a beautiful sight to see the night sky of Wuhan flashing with thousands of beams of light and whistling?

Today, I had a long talk with a volunteer. He told me how he got together with a group of friends. They all showed their abilities and quickly built an effective volunteer team. In this epidemic prevention and control, the first-line medical staff's material, the micro-blog help patient, the first-line reporter's material, the volunteer team all contributed a lot. On the devastated land, these self-organizations can also see the vitality and hope of society.
He also happens to be a post-doctoral fellow at Fudan University. He loves long distance running.

For the past two days I have been interviewing people at a nursing home in Wuhan.
The elderly are the most deadly group in the epidemic, and nursing homes are a gathering place for the elderly. However, there is little media attention to the epidemic and medical supplies will not be provided to the staff of nursing homes. The nursing home has become a dead end in the epidemic.
We spoke to a welfare home in Qiaokou District, Wuhan, where a dozen elderly people had fever and tested positive for nucleic acid three times, including a nursing home attendant. Three old people have died. There are also similar problems at nursing homes in Jiang'an District and Hankou. There was a family all suffering from new crown pneumonia, which the old man hid from his son until his death. However, many nursing homes are not adequately segregated, and some febrile elderly people live with other elderly people, and caregivers who have been in close contact with positive elderly people are not segregated.
The old man's fever had been going on for a long time, and there had been positive cases in early February, but the director of the home insisted in my interview that there were only suspected cases. He admitted to having a positive case in the hospital, but insisted that a positive result was a mere suspicion, ignoring the fifth edition of the treatment plan.
Note: Our story didn't survive long, but it got a lot of attention, and several other media reports also played a powerful role, with volunteer teams and official intervention, so the nursing home materials, nucleic acid testing, isolation measures have been a lot of improvement.

The number of people cured in Hubei Province in recent days has also far exceeded the number of confirmed cases. The main battlefield of the fight against the epidemic has also shifted to the question of how to treat the critically ill. Many provinces and cities have lowered the level of prevention and control, and the topic of resuming work and rebuilding the economy is gradually put on the agenda. The epidemic seems to have passed its worst, and people seem to be taking a breather. Spring is just around the corner, and we are really paying too much for this spring.
I used to love the ending of the The Count of Monte Cristo: "All the wisdom of man is contained in these two words —— Waiting and hoping. ". But now that I think about it, it's still too romantic. We may wait for spring, but waiting does not make the conditions that brought winter to US disappear. Not everyone is as lucky as Dantès to meet the elder and find the treasure. It's always the actions of ordinary people that get us through the winter.
That's why I finally decided to publish the paragraphs in these journals. In the past month, as an intern journalist, I have done very little, but I have seen so many excellent reports, heard so many human tragedies, and listened to the joys and sorrows of many ordinary people through interviews, a little bit of a different experience. To remember it, I wrote it down.
This outbreak is a disaster, and going deep into it, one can see the many problems that have long existed in our land. In the interviews and reading, I saw the backwardness and stagnation of the administrative capacity at the grassroots level, the ignorance, prevarication and concealment of some officials, the long-standing consequences of speech control, and the cynicism, resignation and forgetfulness of ordinary people, their lack of public awareness and selfish side, some of the media's incompetence and ugliness, as well as other media's professionalism, ideals and inescapable limitations. I also saw the vitality of self-organization, the generosity of ordinary health care workers, all of which can not be ignored, there is no love and hatred without reason, it is important to recognize it, to remember it.
Forgetting is the power to decide what should be forgotten that has made up our entire history and will shape all of humanity's future. There are so many things that have happened in this land that have been forgotten, and I don't want it to end up being one of them. We have to remember everything that happened in this cold winter, the late-night lights and whistles, the Howl of the intensive care unit, the tears of the dead relatives, the busy figure of the medical staff. The suffering, the stupidity, the evil, the emotion, the energy, the hope.
The past led us here. It will be a cloud hanging over our generation, a constant reminder of the suffering and the causes of suffering. Maybe we'll learn from it. Maybe there's a silver lining.
May these records remind us of the power of remembering, the power of remembering against the power of forgetting.
Welcome everybody RETWEETS OR CLICKS ON LOOKS!
Of course, most of all, I look forward to your attention

Early in the morning, great changes in the wind and clouds, Wuhan announced the closure of the city. When he woke up, he went to the restaurant and mumbled to his parents, "the city is closed, the city is closed. ". The air was so quiet, the house so empty, it didn't even sound like my own.
To see the elder sister in the ticket circle issued a large paragraph of the text, there is such a sentence: "these (reporter) seniors, in full awareness of the severity of the situation, stay, Farewell, and then stay in the city has long been paralyzed, and unknown virus, waiting for closure. ".
Guan Yi was pushed to the top of the storm because of an article by Caixin, Professor Guan Yi predicted that the number of new crowns would be 10 times that of SARS, which probably aroused the hatred of some people who hid their ears and stole the Bell, plus the word "deserter" in the article, it is a reminder of the extreme nationalism and regional rifts triggered by last year's events in Hong Kong. Stirred up by a few articles written by a thoughtful person, the misplaced national sentiment and the mobilization of the statism have been mixed up, triggering a new wave of public opinion storm. Academics are not immune, truth tellers are vilified, suffering forgotten, and only the statism's sense of self is left in the torrent of public opinion.
Note: Professor Guan Yi has been vindicated recently. His prediction is not only correct, but now it seems to be conservative. The number of infected people is more than ten times that of SARS? But public opinion field everyone forget things, when the battle is very big, but few people pay attention to rehabilitation. How can a voice not be cold?
In the afternoon, a classmate came to me, complaining about the lack of measures to deal with the new type of coronary pneumonia in the county. Henan, a neighboring province, has made a big show of fighting the epidemic, even turning itself into an Internet celebrity. Although our city has no cases yet, it has officially issued some notices, except that the people in the county seem to be living in a greenhouse, unaware of what's going on outside, no one on the street is wearing a mask.
Although in the internship, as if to help a little, but I also know that their own Wuhan, can do very limited. A few friends a discussion, so decided to start from close, and the county to communicate, see if the county media platform can do some publicity, attract the attention of people around.
So I started trying to contact the county. Ask a student intern to contact a publicist. The other side said: "No reporting" , "for fear of causing panic. ".
There's nothing to say. Was Such talk unfamiliar in the early days of the epidemic? Some people wait for instructions, for notifications. Up-and-down prevarication, no initiative and enthusiasm. He's a good boy. Most of the time numb to muddle along, only prevarication time is very active.
"Avoid Panic" has always been the excuse to prevaricate, but in fact, "panic" is a large part of the reason for the non-transparent information. In a life-threatening event like the plague, where vital information almost always comes first from the people, how can it not be scary? How can there be trust? You always say you have to trust the authorities. Can the authorities trust the people? Believe that with the courage to face the Truth and disclose information, people can not panic?

We finally picked up a family member this afternoon. The interview was a bumpy ride. I got in touch with her the day before yesterday, but she is seeing a doctor with her mother and asked me to interview her yesterday. But yesterday afternoon her mother suddenly deteriorated and rushed to the Red Cross Hospital, so that the interview was postponed again.
Seeing a doctor in Wuhan these days is peripatetic, often line up for hours at a time to get a shot. There is no isolation environment, but also the fear of being infected, crowded patients suffer, the atmosphere must be depressed heavy.
After the city was sealed off, they decided to stay home so they could give me an interview. After the interview mixed feelings, confirmed the impression of these days, large hospitals are full, cross-infection is impossible to avoid, the outbreak has long been. It's harder to diagnose, harder to admit.
While waiting for treatment, she said, one patient said, "do you have to boil people to death? " Another family came in with a fever, and the nurse sighed, "this one is too hard. " All the patients were exhausted, the most common thing the family members of the patients said during the interview was "people are numb. ". Today is the New Year's Eve festival, she said: "There is no taste of the year. ". I do not know how many compatriots in Wuhan, is not a taste of the New Year's Eve. At this time how can happy New Year, how can whitewash peace?
The interview ended at a little after 6:00 p.m. , just in time for dinner, and then the family waited to watch the Spring Festival gala. Emotions are contagious, and fear, worry, and pain can linger over the phone. Absent-minded at dinner. I can't watch the gala anymore.
A person went to another room, the next door Spring Festival festival festival gala noise still from time to time through the wall, Yue Yunpeng probably in the talk of no content of the cross talk, sound like Jia Ling also appeared, are old faces. With all the suffering going on, why does it seem like it's business as usual?
I just think the Spring Festival gala is noisy, because human joys and sorrows can be interlinked.

From the day before yesterday, many patients on the ticket circle self-described type of reports, most of the writing of the moving, but there is nothing new, to this day, has felt a bit excessive. There is no disputing the fact that medical supplies are in short supply, beds are in short supply, diagnosis is difficult, suffering is deep, and the situation is critical. Consuming emotions over and over again doesn't help, and requires some deeper reflection.
Reading the plague the other day, history repeats itself. Official support for the big, the People's contempt, superstitious confusion seems to occur today. EXCERPT:
"But he knows that this documentary is not going to be a decisive victory. It is but a testimony of what had to be done, and what must be done in the future, when the god of terror reappears with his merciless butcher's knife, by those who can not be saints, who can not be reconciled to the tyranny of disaster, who set aside their own sufferings, and who only want to be doctors."

Get up this morning, it snowed, hurried back to the county from home. County also began to respond to the new type of coronary pneumonia, the official intervention, the people of a sudden more alert. I think it's very credible... It works better than a normal person ...... Grandma and aunt's village was closed, but grandma and GRANDPA's village had not been closed, and everyone was still making their normal visits, and no one had come to warn them that it was too dangerous, and the village and town cadres were incompetent.

The days began on Dec. 8, when the first patient became ill, and ended on Jan. 20, when Zhong Nanshan spoke. It's obviously a bit late in the game to get this far, but where is it stuck?
According to the Health Commission's website, the first official notification was on 12.31, with 27 cases reported, up until 5 January, with no update on the epidemic from 6 January to 10 January, and from 12 January to 17 January, the numbers didn't go up. That said, from Jan. 5 to Jan. 17, the official notification of the outbreak virtually ground to a halt. As of January 19, the National Health Commission said experts had determined that the outbreak was "preventable and controllable. ".
Meanwhile, Hong Kong activated its "serious" response level as early as January 4, and other countries began reporting cases in mid-january.
Regarding the hospital, according to an interview with the director of the Department of gastroenterology of Wuhan Fifth Hospital by the China Youth Daily, on December 25, she had heard of medical workers suffering from pneumonia of unknown cause (interestingly, no infection was found among the staff, according to a Jan. 11 announcement from the Wuhan Health Commission) , and on January 3, the Fifth Hospital began viral pneumonia training, a number of suspected cases were reported on the 6th, and the emergency and respiratory wards were full in October, "two-thirds of which are estimated to be viral pneumonia" . Similarly, information from other sources can also confirm that many hospitals in Wuhan have already seen a large number of patients with fever around January 10, and bed resources have been strained. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that between early January and mid-january, there has been an outbreak of the new type of coronary pneumonia. This is also consistent with the timing of the spread of the epidemic (the first wave of patients mostly started in December, with an outbreak expected in early January based on the incubation period and the onset cycle) .
At this point, official communications are at a standstill.
A similar picture emerged in the media, which reported the outbreak in early January and followed the confirmation of viral pneumonia as a new form of pneumonia around January 11. But between the 5th and the 10th, the 12th and the 17th, the media and public attention to the new pneumonia was low. A paper in the "mikey flies the plane" public number supports this conclusion by analyzing the reptiles.
Notably, the sessions in Wuhan and Hubei took place from Jan. 5 to Jan. 17, coinciding with the government's announcement that the outbreak had stalled and media attention had dropped. That can't be a coincidence.
In my country, it is almost Open Secrets to maintain social harmony during major conferences. During this time, the media will be aware of certain negative issues (such as the epidemic) , social media will also actively cooperate, launched net action. The Nadir of public opinion and the cessation of negative information were entirely predictable actions.
However, more than ten days of stagnation, is enough to make our country and people in a cunning, sinister virus in front of the loss of control of the Golden Window. The price was a heavy one. When are we gonNA stop with this phony Vanity Project? Can we avoid real disaster and damage for the sake of false prosperity and harmony?
Sorting out the data also found that Wuhan Health Committee of the epidemic notification can not be slow, can not be described as big. It was not until January 14 that the Wuhan Health Commission's seventh circular changed the expression of the epidemic from "no apparent human-to-human transmission" to "limited human-to-human transmission can not be ruled out, " based on the discovery of a family cluster in 41 cases. But in fact, on January 31, the first financial report, has been interviewed about the patients, the husband first became ill, the wife later became ill. According to the definition of "limited human transmission, " according to the report, it can already "not rule out the existence of limited human transmission. ". However, the Health Commission's confirmation is still half a month later.
According to later reports, most hospitals did realize the seriousness of the situation by early January, and the viral pneumonia was open to them at the start of the outbreak. This makes the middle of the ten days of the black box more confusing, but also more regrettable. Even the most cunning viruses have given humans a chance, but they're too busy doing something else.

The Fire God Mountain Hospital was built, and there was a post on Weibo, calling the machines at the site vomiting mud paste, forked sauce and blue forget machine. It was really fun to play with the meat, and I didn't see anyone who really reflected on the epidemic situation and showed consideration for the workers, they're really good at entertaining. In particular, some people called coronavirus a crown, is not know how many families because of this "a crown" displaced, how much suffering is taking place on the earth? How Dare You Call Me Guan?
Press: There have been media reports, Vulcan Mountain Raytheon workers infected with a new coronavirus, this may be the true project. It's not as hot as on Weibo, and it's not as cute as those cartoon machines.

The Red Cross Society was criticized on the Internet for its poor delivery of materials. Today, I read an article by southern weekend and interviewed internal staff of the Red Cross Society. Roughly speaking, the Red Cross Society does not have the power to issue materials. The power to issue materials is in the Health Commission, no approval, no distribution. We have very limited manpower, and we're overworked.
This is also typical, as the habit of listening to others and a highly centralized system can lead to such problems. As a result, the HHS does not necessarily have the energy to allocate supplies one by one, and the Red Cross, as an executive body, is accustomed to being obedient, having neither the capacity to deal with the situation nor the courage to act beyond its mandate.

Interviewed a mother and son today.
The mother's fever started on January 17th, the son's on the 21st. They were treated at Wuhan Ninth Hospital. The hospital gave nucleic acid test to all patients in the observation room on the 28th and 29th, the son is positive, the mother is negative. After that, the son was quickly admitted to the hospital, while the mother was informed several times to transfer hospital.
The saddest part is that although the son was diagnosed positive by nucleic acid, the symptoms were relatively mild, while the mother, though negative, had already developed dyspnea a week ago, which is a serious case. But transferred to the ninth floor ward for systematic treatment (which also means critical care) was the son, while the mother had to continue to languish in a crowded observation room on the fourth floor, where medical conditions and staff were inadequate, every day a patient dies of respiratory failure, and the hospital is too busy to care.
"I wish I had been positive, " the woman told me several times during the interview, after she was disqualified from the hospital after two negative nucleic acid tests. The result of a nucleic acid test sends mother and son to the ends of the Earth. Is this too rigid a way to tell patients apart?
In particular, we have always described the fight against the epidemic as a war. We have used numerous military words to describe the fight against the epidemic. We have used the entire national system to prevent and control the epidemic. War Can not be avoided without sacrifice, has this kind of hype and emphasis also resulted in many unnecessary sacrifices?
The prevention and treatment of the epidemic directly related to the territorial officials, so the treatment of positive patients will become a hard target, limited resources, negative patients have no time to take care of. Under the rigid command, under the great pressure of losing the black hat, the attention to one group of people often leads to the neglect of another group of people. Thus, mild positive cases can be treated, while severe negative cases of dyspnea are discharged.
In addition, the nucleic acid test as the only diagnostic standard, which itself has many problems. Some doctors have pointed out the uncertainty of nucleic acid testing and the need to combine it with CT clinical judgment. In Wuhan, however, nucleic acid testing is the only standard of diagnosis and treatment. However, due to limited resources, it is impossible to arrange as many tests as possible for patients as in other provinces to reduce the number of errors and missed results. Thus, a piece of paper test to determine the fate of the tragedy has occurred.
When I first took the drastic measures, I was fully expecting them to lead to our ultimate victory. But these days, sacrifices are being made, and we're not alone in seeing people go off their meds, we're seeing other patients die, we're seeing more people whose lives have been radically changed by this tragedy. Their voices had been drowned out by the heat of the war, but the pain would not go away. Is it just a woman's kindness?
T and his friend talked a lot about it, but no one could get an answer. All we knew was that it was a disaster, and the suffering in the sun and in the shadows was immense. We can not ignore the rationality of some measures under the overall situation of epidemic prevention, but neither can we ignore the Poker Face of suffering. It was a disaster.
According to: The interview of a mother and son, the Son has been discharged from the hospital, the mother has been transferred to the hospital on the 14th. The operation of the Shelter Hospital and the change of the diagnosis and treatment have played a key role in the alleviation of the situation.

T reporter's report "who is the "false negative" new type of coronary pneumonia patients, " issued, the response is Great.
Many doctors, experts have confirmed that there may be uncertainty in nucleic acid testing, clinical cases also highlighted this point. In contrast, the diagnosis and treatment of SARS in CT clinical diagnosis and confirmed diagnosis of nucleic acid is a level, this new pneumonia diagnosis and treatment of only one nucleic acid, appears to be more stringent.
When medical resources in other provinces are sufficient, it is reasonable to focus on nucleic acid testing, but Hubei, especially Wuhan, is very tight. If only nucleic acid testing is used as the sole criterion, there will be a lot of "false negative" patients can not be treated, or even because of not doing a good job of isolation and infection to others, the risk is great.
A number of media outlets have joined forces to raise the issue of nucleic acid testing, and official policies and treatment plans have quickly changed. In the fifth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan, the diagnostic criteria of suspected cases were relaxed separately for Hubei Province, and CT clinical diagnosis was added.

Dr. Lee WL is dead. The Nation Mourns.
Rationally speaking, on a factual level, there are some parts of Dr. Lee's story that are narrated. For example, Dr. Li's early warning in the group was on December 31, and according to my previous combing, the Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission had already notified the Community of the outbreak on that day. In addition, according to a report by the Changjiang daily in an interview with Dr. Zhang Jixian of Xinhua Hospital in Hubei Province, as early as December 27, Dr. Zhang Jixian has already notified his superiors to report the viral pneumonia situation to the Jiang'an District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan. These circumstances suggest that the reporting channel remained open at the outset of the outbreak. The critical time for things to go bad is between January 5th and January 20th.
But so what? We should see public anger. Dr. Li is a symbol, his experience is also too suitable to become a symbol, whistle-blower was admonished, and eventually died of new crown pneumonia, "for the people pay, frozen in the snow. ".
We can not allow Dr. Lee to be mythologized again as a hero, to be celebrated, and then forgotten in a celebrated way. He is a human being just like us, and just as ordinary as he is, let each of us equally ordinary, equally likely at some point to encounter injustice, want to do the right thing and often feel powerless, ordinary people feel empathy. We pray for him and his family, for an ordinary person who still has a sense of justice and love, for people who are used to silence to stop being silent, to stop repressing the anger that has been pent up for so long. The anger of those who have long controlled public opinion, the disgust of the crime of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble" , the anger of the cover-up and suppression in the early stages of the epidemic, the anger of the unrestrained myth of sacrifice.
We should remember this morning's outrage as a human being who suffered injustice, not as a fallen hero. Remember the reason behind the tragedy. Don't let your anger go to waste.
Note: On the night of Dr. Li Wenliang's death, many citizens spontaneously turned on their flashlights and shot their whistles into the sky, echoing through the night sky of Wuhan. Countless ordinary people used it to honor the departure of another ordinary person, and the beams and whistles symbolized the empathy of countless ordinary people. Isn't it a beautiful sight to see the night sky of Wuhan flashing with thousands of beams of light and whistling?

Today, I had a long talk with a volunteer. He told me how he got together with a group of friends. They all showed their abilities and quickly built an effective volunteer team. In this epidemic prevention and control, the first-line medical staff's material, the micro-blog help patient, the first-line reporter's material, the volunteer team all contributed a lot. On the devastated land, these self-organizations can also see the vitality and hope of society.
He also happens to be a post-doctoral fellow at Fudan University. He loves long distance running.

For the past two days I have been interviewing people at a nursing home in Wuhan.
The elderly are the most deadly group in the epidemic, and nursing homes are a gathering place for the elderly. However, there is little media attention to the epidemic and medical supplies will not be provided to the staff of nursing homes. The nursing home has become a dead end in the epidemic.
We spoke to a welfare home in Qiaokou District, Wuhan, where a dozen elderly people had fever and tested positive for nucleic acid three times, including a nursing home attendant. Three old people have died. There are also similar problems at nursing homes in Jiang'an District and Hankou. There was a family all suffering from new crown pneumonia, which the old man hid from his son until his death. However, many nursing homes are not adequately segregated, and some febrile elderly people live with other elderly people, and caregivers who have been in close contact with positive elderly people are not segregated.
The old man's fever had been going on for a long time, and there had been positive cases in early February, but the director of the home insisted in my interview that there were only suspected cases. He admitted to having a positive case in the hospital, but insisted that a positive result was a mere suspicion, ignoring the fifth edition of the treatment plan.
Note: Our story didn't survive long, but it got a lot of attention, and several other media reports also played a powerful role, with volunteer teams and official intervention, so the nursing home materials, nucleic acid testing, isolation measures have been a lot of improvement.

The number of people cured in Hubei Province in recent days has also far exceeded the number of confirmed cases. The main battlefield of the fight against the epidemic has also shifted to the question of how to treat the critically ill. Many provinces and cities have lowered the level of prevention and control, and the topic of resuming work and rebuilding the economy is gradually put on the agenda. The epidemic seems to have passed its worst, and people seem to be taking a breather. Spring is just around the corner, and we are really paying too much for this spring.
I used to love the ending of the The Count of Monte Cristo: "All the wisdom of man is contained in these two words —— Waiting and hoping. ". But now that I think about it, it's still too romantic. We may wait for spring, but waiting does not make the conditions that brought winter to US disappear. Not everyone is as lucky as Dantès to meet the elder and find the treasure. It's always the actions of ordinary people that get us through the winter.
That's why I finally decided to publish the paragraphs in these journals. In the past month, as an intern journalist, I have done very little, but I have seen so many excellent reports, heard so many human tragedies, and listened to the joys and sorrows of many ordinary people through interviews, a little bit of a different experience. To remember it, I wrote it down.
This outbreak is a disaster, and going deep into it, one can see the many problems that have long existed in our land. In the interviews and reading, I saw the backwardness and stagnation of the administrative capacity at the grassroots level, the ignorance, prevarication and concealment of some officials, the long-standing consequences of speech control, and the cynicism, resignation and forgetfulness of ordinary people, their lack of public awareness and selfish side, some of the media's incompetence and ugliness, as well as other media's professionalism, ideals and inescapable limitations. I also saw the vitality of self-organization, the generosity of ordinary health care workers, all of which can not be ignored, there is no love and hatred without reason, it is important to recognize it, to remember it.
Forgetting is the power to decide what should be forgotten that has made up our entire history and will shape all of humanity's future. There are so many things that have happened in this land that have been forgotten, and I don't want it to end up being one of them. We have to remember everything that happened in this cold winter, the late-night lights and whistles, the Howl of the intensive care unit, the tears of the dead relatives, the busy figure of the medical staff. The suffering, the stupidity, the evil, the emotion, the energy, the hope.
The past led us here. It will be a cloud hanging over our generation, a constant reminder of the suffering and the causes of suffering. Maybe we'll learn from it. Maybe there's a silver lining.
May these records remind us of the power of remembering, the power of remembering against the power of forgetting.

Write in the Front:
At 7:30 on January 22, I woke up, turned on my mobile phone and saw a message from reporter L: "I went to Wuhan to cover the coronavirus. Do you have any interest in the rear support? "
The first feeling is hard to describe, a bit like "Khan big point soldiers, roll roll has a Ye Ming" (?) . My days of fishing are over, and I'm about to start touching history. It's amazing to think that, less than two months ago, I was in Singapore, enjoying my last foreign leisure, reading, swimming and working out every day. Take the bus to see Singapore's clean, beautiful street scene, the endless summer long.
On the afternoon of December 3, while waiting for a flight home from Singapore Changi Airport, it occurred to me that I might as well take an internship at a newspaper. Four months of solitary life in Singapore, of closed reading and exercise, made me feel more empty, closed, and cowardly than I had ever felt before, and it was the process of resistance and reconstruction that brought me back to my high spirits. That afternoon at the airport, I suddenly wanted to leave the stack of books to do something. Now I think it is the double growth of body and spirit that leads me to the place I must arrive. But who would have thought such an event would have occurred?

In the morning, I saw a link to a request for help from some family members of the patients on Weibo. Most of these patients had viral infections on CT scans that ruled out swine flu, swine flu, and other possible causes, most likely new pneumonia, but could not be diagnosed or treated. The family's last resort is to tweet for help. This reflects at least two messages: 1. Hospital beds have been severely overloaded, and this is by no means the result of a sudden occurrence in recent days; 2. A large number of critically ill patients remain undiagnosed and unable to be hospitalized. The official count at the time was 440.
Spent the day tweeting to the families of the patients who were asking for help. Most of them ignore me, understandably. One family member attracted the attention of a certain department by asking for help through Weibo. After the problem of hospitalization was properly solved, he did not want to be exposed any more. That's understandable. For the family, saving lives is important. All that empty public value is no match for the misery at hand.
And I'm glad they're well taken care of. But at the same time there is a lingering shadow: They micro-blog for help, loud enough to attract the attention of Yousi, through the immediate difficulties. But what about the silent ones? What about those who suffer in silence? With limited beds, one suffering is solved, and one suffering is lost. Was it the voice of the one who measured the severity of the suffering and determined the priority of treatment?
This is the truth that we have always seen in public opinion. Small things, big things is the basic maintenance of stability posture, so make things become a magic weapon in the face of injustice. When will this distorted mechanism of public opinion be eliminated? Why are we still unable to achieve justice through the normal, stable mechanism, still have to rely on outside of the regular complaint to seek justice? The ancient people beat the drum, today's citizens micro-blog help, change only the means of technology. Still can not get rid of, is to the worship of the Blue Sky Big Lord, "asks the heaven to give the slave master" .
When push comes to shove, we rely so heavily on public opinion. But the power of our supervision of public opinion is so inevitably weak. At the same time, we have to constantly face public alert and criticism. Aren't "rumors" , "unscrupulous media" and "foreign forces" our most common slogan? Ask yourself if these slogans are disciplining you and me as apathetic spectators, being very critical of the speakers, and believing in the one voice?
In the afternoon, a patient with mild illness was picked up on Douban. He said the fever clinic was full. And stay in Wuhan Friends Chat, he said Wuhan medical staff infection is not optimistic.

Guan Yi was pushed to the top of the storm because of an article by Caixin, Professor Guan Yi predicted that the number of new crowns would be 10 times that of SARS, which probably aroused the hatred of some people who hid their ears and stole the Bell, plus the word "deserter" in the article, it is a reminder of the extreme nationalism and regional rifts triggered by last year's events in Hong Kong.

Note: Professor Guan Yi has been vindicated recently. His prediction is not only correct, but now it seems to be conservative. The number of infected people is more than ten times that of SARS? But public opinion field everyone forget things, when the battle is very big, but few people pay attention to rehabilitation. How can a voice not be cold?
In the afternoon, a classmate came to me, complaining about the lack of measures to deal with the new type of coronary pneumonia in the county. Henan, a neighboring province, has made a big show of fighting the epidemic, even turning itself into an Internet celebrity. Although our city has no cases yet, it has officially issued some notices, except that the people in the county seem to be living in a greenhouse, unaware of what's going on outside, no one on the street is wearing a mask.
Although in the internship, as if to help a little, but I also know that their own Wuhan, can do very limited. A few friends a discussion, so decided to start from close, and the county to communicate, see if the county media platform can do some publicity, attract the attention of people around.
So I started trying to contact the county. Ask a student intern to contact a publicist. The other side said: "No reporting" , "for fear of causing panic. ".
There's nothing to say. Was Such talk unfamiliar in the early days of the epidemic? Some people wait for instructions, for notifications. Up-and-down prevarication, no initiative and enthusiasm. He's a good boy. Most of the time numb to muddle along, only prevarication time is very active.
"Avoid Panic" has always been the excuse to prevaricate, but in fact, "panic" is a large part of the reason for the non-transparent information. In a life-threatening event like the plague, where vital information almost always comes first from the people, how can it not be scary? How can there be trust? You always say you have to trust the authorities. Can the authorities trust the people? Believe that with the courage to face the Truth and disclose information, people can not panic?

Early in the morning, great changes in the wind and clouds, Wuhan announced the closure of the city. When he woke up, he went to the restaurant and mumbled to his parents, "the city is closed, the city is closed. ". The air was so quiet, the house so empty, it didn't even sound like my own.

To see the elder sister in the ticket circle issued a large paragraph of the text, there is such a sentence: "these (reporter) seniors, in full awareness of the severity of the situation, stay, Farewell, and then stay in the city has long been paralyzed, and unknown virus, waiting for closure. ".

Guan Yi was pushed to the top of the storm because of an article by Caixin, Professor Guan Yi predicted that the number of new crowns would be 10 times that of SARS, which probably aroused the hatred of some people who hid their ears and stole the Bell, plus the word "deserter" in the article, it is a reminder of the extreme nationalism and regional rifts triggered by last year's events in Hong Kong. Stirred up by a few articles written by a thoughtful person, the misplaced national sentiment and the mobilization of the statism have been mixed up, triggering a new wave of public opinion storm. Academics are not immune, truth tellers are vilified, suffering forgotten, and only the statism's sense of self is left in the torrent of public opinion.

We finally picked up a family member this afternoon. The interview was a bumpy ride. I got in touch with her the day before yesterday, but she is seeing a doctor with her mother and asked me to interview her yesterday. But yesterday afternoon her mother suddenly deteriorated and rushed to the Red Cross Hospital, so that the interview was postponed again.
Seeing a doctor in Wuhan these days is peripatetic, often line up for hours at a time to get a shot. There is no isolation environment, but also the fear of being infected, crowded patients suffer, the atmosphere must be depressed heavy.
After the city was sealed off, they decided to stay home so they could give me an interview. After the interview mixed feelings, confirmed the impression of these days, large hospitals are full, cross-infection is impossible to avoid, the outbreak has long been. It's harder to diagnose, harder to admit.
While waiting for treatment, she said, one patient said, "do you have to boil people to death? " Another family came in with a fever, and the nurse sighed, "this one is too hard. " All the patients were exhausted, the most common thing the family members of the patients said during the interview was "people are numb. ". Today is the New Year's Eve festival, she said: "There is no taste of the year. ". I do not know how many compatriots in Wuhan, is not a taste of the New Year's Eve. At this time how can happy New Year, how can whitewash peace?
The interview ended at a little after 6:00 p.m. , just in time for dinner, and then the family waited to watch the Spring Festival gala. Emotions are contagious, and fear, worry, and pain can linger over the phone. Absent-minded at dinner. I can't watch the gala anymore.
A person went to another room, the next door Spring Festival festival festival gala noise still from time to time through the wall, Yue Yunpeng probably in the talk of no content of the cross talk, sound like Jia Ling also appeared, are old faces. With all the suffering going on, why does it seem like it's business as usual?
I just think the Spring Festival gala is noisy, because human joys and sorrows can be interlinked.

From the day before yesterday, many patients on the ticket circle self-described type of reports, most of the writing of the moving, but there is nothing new, to this day, has felt a bit excessive. There is no disputing the fact that medical supplies are in short supply, beds are in short supply, diagnosis is difficult, suffering is deep, and the situation is critical. Consuming emotions over and over again doesn't help, and requires some deeper reflection.
Reading the plague the other day, history repeats itself. Official support for the big, the People's contempt, superstitious confusion seems to occur today. EXCERPT:
"But he knows that this documentary is not going to be a decisive victory. It is but a testimony of what had to be done, and what must be done in the future, when the god of terror reappears with his merciless butcher's knife, by those who can not be saints, who can not be reconciled to the tyranny of disaster, who set aside their own sufferings, and who only want to be doctors."

Grandma and aunt's village was closed, but grandma and GRANDPA's village had not been closed, and everyone was still making their normal visits, and no one had come to warn them that it was too dangerous, and the village and town cadres were incompetent.

The days began on Dec. 8, when the first patient became ill, and ended on Jan. 20, when Zhong Nanshan spoke. It's obviously a bit late in the game to get this far, but where is it stuck?
According to the Health Commission's website, the first official notification was on 12.31, with 27 cases reported, up until 5 January, with no update on the epidemic from 6 January to 10 January, and from 12 January to 17 January, the numbers didn't go up. That said, from Jan. 5 to Jan. 17, the official notification of the outbreak virtually ground to a halt. As of January 19, the National Health Commission said experts had determined that the outbreak was "preventable and controllable. ".
Meanwhile, Hong Kong activated its "serious" response level as early as January 4, and other countries began reporting cases in mid-january.
Regarding the hospital, according to an interview with the director of the Department of gastroenterology of Wuhan Fifth Hospital by the China Youth Daily, on December 25, she had heard of medical workers suffering from pneumonia of unknown cause (interestingly, no infection was found among the staff, according to a Jan. 11 announcement from the Wuhan Health Commission) , and on January 3, the Fifth Hospital began viral pneumonia training, a number of suspected cases were reported on the 6th, and the emergency and respiratory wards were full in October, "two-thirds of which are estimated to be viral pneumonia" . Similarly, information from other sources can also confirm that many hospitals in Wuhan have already seen a large number of patients with fever around January 10, and bed resources have been strained. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that between early January and mid-january, there has been an outbreak of the new type of coronary pneumonia. This is also consistent with the timing of the spread of the epidemic (the first wave of patients mostly started in December, with an outbreak expected in early January based on the incubation period and the onset cycle) .
At this point, official communications are at a standstill.
A similar picture emerged in the media, which reported the outbreak in early January and followed the confirmation of viral pneumonia as a new form of pneumonia around January 11. But between the 5th and the 10th, the 12th and the 17th, the media and public attention to the new pneumonia was low. A paper in the "mikey flies the plane" public number supports this conclusion by analyzing the reptiles.
Notably, the sessions in Wuhan and Hubei took place from Jan. 5 to Jan. 17, coinciding with the government's announcement that the outbreak had stalled and media attention had dropped. That can't be a coincidence.
In my country, it is almost Open Secrets to maintain social harmony during major conferences. During this time, the media will be aware of certain negative issues (such as the epidemic) , social media will also actively cooperate, launched net action. The Nadir of public opinion and the cessation of negative information were entirely predictable actions.
However, more than ten days of stagnation, is enough to make our country and people in a cunning, sinister virus in front of the loss of control of the Golden Window. The price was a heavy one. When are we gonNA stop with this phony Vanity Project? Can we avoid real disaster and damage for the sake of false prosperity and harmony?
Sorting out the data also found that Wuhan Health Committee of the epidemic notification can not be slow, can not be described as big. It was not until January 14 that the Wuhan Health Commission's seventh circular changed the expression of the epidemic from "no apparent human-to-human transmission" to "limited human-to-human transmission can not be ruled out, " based on the discovery of a family cluster in 41 cases. But in fact, on January 31, the first financial report, has been interviewed about the patients, the husband first became ill, the wife later became ill. According to the definition of "limited human transmission, " according to the report, it can already "not rule out the existence of limited human transmission. ". However, the Health Commission's confirmation is still half a month later.
According to later reports, most hospitals did realize the seriousness of the situation by early January, and the viral pneumonia was open to them at the start of the outbreak. This makes the middle of the ten days of the black box more confusing, but also more regrettable. Even the most cunning viruses have given humans a chance, but they're too busy doing something else.

It was really fun to play with the meat, and I didn't see anyone who really reflected on the epidemic situation and showed consideration for the workers, they're really good at entertaining. In particular, some people called coronavirus a crown, is not know how many families because of this "a crown" displaced, how much suffering is taking place on the earth? How Dare You Call Me Guan?
Press: There have been media reports, Vulcan Mountain Raytheon workers infected with a new coronavirus, this may be the true project. It's not as hot as on Weibo, and it's not as cute as those cartoon machines.

The Red Cross Society was criticized on the Internet for its poor delivery of materials. Today, I read an article by southern weekend and interviewed internal staff of the Red Cross Society. Roughly speaking, the Red Cross Society does not have the power to issue materials. The power to issue materials is in the Health Commission, no approval, no distribution. We have very limited manpower, and we're overworked.
This is also typical, as the habit of listening to others and a highly centralized system can lead to such problems. As a result, the HHS does not necessarily have the energy to allocate supplies one by one, and the Red Cross, as an executive body, is accustomed to being obedient, having neither the capacity to deal with the situation nor the courage to act beyond its mandate.

Interviewed a mother and son today.
The mother's fever started on January 17th, the son's on the 21st. They were treated at Wuhan Ninth Hospital. The hospital gave nucleic acid test to all patients in the observation room on the 28th and 29th, the son is positive, the mother is negative. After that, the son was quickly admitted to the hospital, while the mother was informed several times to transfer hospital.
The saddest part is that although the son was diagnosed positive by nucleic acid, the symptoms were relatively mild, while the mother, though negative, had already developed dyspnea a week ago, which is a serious case. But transferred to the ninth floor ward for systematic treatment (which also means critical care) was the son, while the mother had to continue to languish in a crowded observation room on the fourth floor, where medical conditions and staff were inadequate, every day a patient dies of respiratory failure, and the hospital is too busy to care.
"I wish I had been positive, " the woman told me several times during the interview, after she was disqualified from the hospital after two negative nucleic acid tests. The result of a nucleic acid test sends mother and son to the ends of the Earth. Is this too rigid a way to tell patients apart?
In particular, we have always described the fight against the epidemic as a war. We have used numerous military words to describe the fight against the epidemic. We have used the entire national system to prevent and control the epidemic. War Can not be avoided without sacrifice, has this kind of hype and emphasis also resulted in many unnecessary sacrifices?
The prevention and treatment of the epidemic directly related to the territorial officials, so the treatment of positive patients will become a hard target, limited resources, negative patients have no time to take care of. Under the rigid command, under the great pressure of losing the black hat, the attention to one group of people often leads to the neglect of another group of people. Thus, mild positive cases can be treated, while severe negative cases of dyspnea are discharged.
In addition, the nucleic acid test as the only diagnostic standard, which itself has many problems. Some doctors have pointed out the uncertainty of nucleic acid testing and the need to combine it with CT clinical judgment. In Wuhan, however, nucleic acid testing is the only standard of diagnosis and treatment. However, due to limited resources, it is impossible to arrange as many tests as possible for patients as in other provinces to reduce the number of errors and missed results. Thus, a piece of paper test to determine the fate of the tragedy has occurred.
When I first took the drastic measures, I was fully expecting them to lead to our ultimate victory. But these days, sacrifices are being made, and we're not alone in seeing people go off their meds, we're seeing other patients die, we're seeing more people whose lives have been radically changed by this tragedy. Their voices had been drowned out by the heat of the war, but the pain would not go away. Is it just a woman's kindness?
T and his friend talked a lot about it, but no one could get an answer. All we knew was that it was a disaster, and the suffering in the sun and in the shadows was immense. We can not ignore the rationality of some measures under the overall situation of epidemic prevention, but neither can we ignore the Poker Face of suffering. It was a disaster.
According to: The interview of a mother and son, the Son has been discharged from the hospital, the mother has been transferred to the hospital on the 14th. The operation of the Shelter Hospital and the change of the diagnosis and treatment have played a key role in the alleviation of the situation.

T reporter's report "who is the "false negative" new type of coronary pneumonia patients, " issued, the response is Great.
Many doctors, experts have confirmed that there may be uncertainty in nucleic acid testing, clinical cases also highlighted this point. In contrast, the diagnosis and treatment of SARS in CT clinical diagnosis and confirmed diagnosis of nucleic acid is a level, this new pneumonia diagnosis and treatment of only one nucleic acid, appears to be more stringent.
When medical resources in other provinces are sufficient, it is reasonable to focus on nucleic acid testing, but Hubei, especially Wuhan, is very tight. If only nucleic acid testing is used as the sole criterion, there will be a lot of "false negative" patients can not be treated, or even because of not doing a good job of isolation and infection to others, the risk is great.
A number of media outlets have joined forces to raise the issue of nucleic acid testing, and official policies and treatment plans have quickly changed. In the fifth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan, the diagnostic criteria of suspected cases were relaxed separately for Hubei Province, and CT clinical diagnosis was added.

Dr. Lee WL is dead. The Nation Mourns.
Rationally speaking, on a factual level, there are some parts of Dr. Lee's story that are narrated. For example, Dr. Li's early warning in the group was on December 31, and according to my previous combing, the Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission had already notified the Community of the outbreak on that day. In addition, according to a report by the Changjiang daily in an interview with Dr. Zhang Jixian of Xinhua Hospital in Hubei Province, as early as December 27, Dr. Zhang Jixian has already notified his superiors to report the viral pneumonia situation to the Jiang'an District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan. These circumstances suggest that the reporting channel remained open at the outset of the outbreak. The critical time for things to go bad is between January 5th and January 20th.
But so what? We should see public anger. Dr. Li is a symbol, his experience is also too suitable to become a symbol, whistle-blower was admonished, and eventually died of new crown pneumonia, "for the people pay, frozen in the snow. ".
We can not allow Dr. Lee to be mythologized again as a hero, to be celebrated, and then forgotten in a celebrated way. He is a human being just like us, and just as ordinary as he is, let each of us equally ordinary, equally likely at some point to encounter injustice, want to do the right thing and often feel powerless, ordinary people feel empathy. We pray for him and his family, for an ordinary person who still has a sense of justice and love, for people who are used to silence to stop being silent, to stop repressing the anger that has been pent up for so long. The anger of those who have long controlled public opinion, the disgust of the crime of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble" , the anger of the cover-up and suppression in the early stages of the epidemic, the anger of the unrestrained myth of sacrifice.
We should remember this morning's outrage as a human being who suffered injustice, not as a fallen hero. Remember the reason behind the tragedy. Don't let your anger go to waste.
Note: On the night of Dr. Li Wenliang's death, many citizens spontaneously turned on their flashlights and shot their whistles into the sky, echoing through the night sky of Wuhan. Countless ordinary people used it to honor the departure of another ordinary person, and the beams and whistles symbolized the empathy of countless ordinary people. Isn't it a beautiful sight to see the night sky of Wuhan flashing with thousands of beams of light and whistling?

Dr. Lee WL is dead. The Nation Mourns.

Today, I had a long talk with a volunteer. He told me how he got together with a group of friends. They all showed their abilities and quickly built an effective volunteer team. In this epidemic prevention and control, the first-line medical staff's material, the micro-blog help patient, the first-line reporter's material, the volunteer team all contributed a lot. On the devastated land, these self-organizations can also see the vitality and hope of society.
He also happens to be a post-doctoral fellow at Fudan University. He loves long distance running.

For the past two days I have been interviewing people at a nursing home in Wuhan.
The elderly are the most deadly group in the epidemic, and nursing homes are a gathering place for the elderly. However, there is little media attention to the epidemic and medical supplies will not be provided to the staff of nursing homes. The nursing home has become a dead end in the epidemic.
We spoke to a welfare home in Qiaokou District, Wuhan, where a dozen elderly people had fever and tested positive for nucleic acid three times, including a nursing home attendant. Three old people have died. There are also similar problems at nursing homes in Jiang'an District and Hankou. There was a family all suffering from new crown pneumonia, which the old man hid from his son until his death. However, many nursing homes are not adequately segregated, and some febrile elderly people live with other elderly people, and caregivers who have been in close contact with positive elderly people are not segregated.
The old man's fever had been going on for a long time, and there had been positive cases in early February, but the director of the home insisted in my interview that there were only suspected cases. He admitted to having a positive case in the hospital, but insisted that a positive result was a mere suspicion, ignoring the fifth edition of the treatment plan.
Note: Our story didn't survive long, but it got a lot of attention, and several other media reports also played a powerful role, with volunteer teams and official intervention, so the nursing home materials, nucleic acid testing, isolation measures have been a lot of improvement.

The number of people cured in Hubei Province in recent days has also far exceeded the number of confirmed cases. The main battlefield of the fight against the epidemic has also shifted to the question of how to treat the critically ill. Many provinces and cities have lowered the level of prevention and control, and the topic of resuming work and rebuilding the economy is gradually put on the agenda. The epidemic seems to have passed its worst, and people seem to be taking a breather. Spring is just around the corner, and we are really paying too much for this spring.
I used to love the ending of the The Count of Monte Cristo: "All the wisdom of man is contained in these two words —— Waiting and hoping. ". But now that I think about it, it's still too romantic. We may wait for spring, but waiting does not make the conditions that brought winter to US disappear. Not everyone is as lucky as Dantès to meet the elder and find the treasure. It's always the actions of ordinary people that get us through the winter.
That's why I finally decided to publish the paragraphs in these journals. In the past month, as an intern journalist, I have done very little, but I have seen so many excellent reports, heard so many human tragedies, and listened to the joys and sorrows of many ordinary people through interviews, a little bit of a different experience. To remember it, I wrote it down.
This outbreak is a disaster, and going deep into it, one can see the many problems that have long existed in our land. In the interviews and reading, I saw the backwardness and stagnation of the administrative capacity at the grassroots level, the ignorance, prevarication and concealment of some officials, the long-standing consequences of speech control, and the cynicism, resignation and forgetfulness of ordinary people, their lack of public awareness and selfish side, some of the media's incompetence and ugliness, as well as other media's professionalism, ideals and inescapable limitations. I also saw the vitality of self-organization, the generosity of ordinary health care workers, all of which can not be ignored, there is no love and hatred without reason, it is important to recognize it, to remember it.
Forgetting is the power to decide what should be forgotten that has made up our entire history and will shape all of humanity's future. There are so many things that have happened in this land that have been forgotten, and I don't want it to end up being one of them. We have to remember everything that happened in this cold winter, the late-night lights and whistles, the Howl of the intensive care unit, the tears of the dead relatives, the busy figure of the medical staff. The suffering, the stupidity, the evil, the emotion, the energy, the hope.
The past led us here. It will be a cloud hanging over our generation, a constant reminder of the suffering and the causes of suffering. Maybe we'll learn from it. Maybe there's a silver lining.
May these records remind us of the power of remembering, the power of remembering against the power of forgetting.
