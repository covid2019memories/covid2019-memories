##Line of thought | preservation of the memory of the age -- a discussion on "the group of selections"

Micro Signal Anti

Features A2n, Anti-2019-ncov. A group of folk volunteers whose main work is to popularize science and dispel rumors.

In early February, the document new pneumonia: Media reporting and nonfiction writing was picked up by a number of people.

The "select team" that produced the document hopes to help people sort out in-depth reports, non-fiction writing and personal narratives about the epidemic, leaving a little "memory of the Times. ". In particular, they call attention to "personal narratives" , which may be one-sided, emotional and not necessarily "correct" narratives that can only be expressed by those who are experiencing the moment. And what's valuable about the personal narrative is that it preserves some of the less-heard voices from official or mainstream channels, providing a richer perspective for those who want to understand the epidemic now and in the future.

In the first part of the activity, we talked to Shao Tang, the founder of the editing group, and he shared his thoughts on some issues.

About the project

"Nonfiction" is a subtle category
Q
Wen Jing: Why do you want to do this project? How has it changed since the beginning?
Shao Tang: there are three main stages. In the first stage, we do a selection of in-depth content and personal narrative catalogues, so that you can easily read excellent reports from media like Caixin and Sanlian, as well as personal narrative of some of the people who have experienced it. About a week later, some of the collected content can no longer be read. With the enthusiastic urging and assistance of many netizens, our focus shifted from "helping readers choose articles" to organizing and archiving articles. After a week or two, we began to see what we could use as a database for studying outbreaks, and we wanted to refine our collection from that point of view. It is also for the latter two considerations that the scope and standard of the selection is somewhat wider than at first.

Q
Wenjing: your website shows that the current content is divided into reports, nonfiction and personal narratives. What are the main sources of this content? Why is it divided like this?
Shao Tang: we mainly collect articles from wechat public accounts and news media websites. These three categories are virtually indistinguishable, especially nonfiction writing and personal narratives. "nonfiction writing" is a subtler category. On our website, the English title for nonfiction writing is non-fiction writing, but there's a big difference. English non-fiction is the opposite of fiction, that is, as long as the content is not fiction, not fiction, can be classified as non-fiction. But in the context of the current Chinese Internet, non-fiction writing is a popular style of "using novel writing techniques to write real stories" . Like the true story project, mammon.
Q
Wenjing: But many of Mimeng's contents are fictional, only its style is "non-fictional" . How is this "nonfiction" defined?
Shao Tang: right, actually more than Mimi Meng, there are a lot of "non-fiction" banner from the media, the content may have fictional elements. It acts as a spectrum, with some nonfiction content more likely to be personal, less edited after a conversation with the interviewee, and some more edited. The problem is that we don't know how much the author has altered the authenticity of the content when we read the article. In addition, some of the nonfiction content is written more like a story, in the third person and with a holistic approach, while others mimic the personal narrative so much that the reader may even think they are written by themselves. So we kept the "nonfiction" category. The current criterion is that if it is known that the "I" in the text is the author, it is classified as a personal narrative; if not, it is classified as non-fiction.

Q
Wen Jing: How do you save articles that are no longer readable online? Will there be copyright issues?
Shao Tang: Since there is a sense of archiving, we will take the initiative to put every article included in the archive. Issues can also be used to help you find the original version of an article, as well as make a backup copy of it while you read it. But because our technology doesn't allow full-time automatic archiving, we can't retrieve articles if they're unreadable by the time we see them, or if people don't archive them.

With respect to copyright, we try to avoid problems as much as possible. First of all, collate all the articles are currently free public online, no paid content, our site also has no business purposes. Second, we will not reprint the full text, but only give the source, attached links, close to a reference. And once we receive a complaint about copyright infringement from the author or the media, we will immediately withdraw the article and apologize.
Q
Wenjing: If an article doesn't change after being reprinted, why find the original version / link?
Shao Tang: If the article is reprinted, we can not guarantee that it is not modified. For example, Fang Fang's blog, which has been criticized online for "having a lot of unwanted phones lying on the floor at the funeral home, " has not been checked by fact, citing the fact that it had been "searched for pictures" and found that the pictures were photos of old phones that had been disposed of long ago. But as we later learned, Fang Fang's post wasn't illustrated, it was added as it was being circulated. This is a good example, it tells us that we should know to look for the source of information.

Sometimes, even if the article is not reprinted, but reposted on the same platform, there will still be changes. For example, freezing point weekly republished an article one day, the full text content is the same, only changed the sub-title, the positioning and understanding of the article also has a great impact. We'd like to keep it all. It may also have to do with my own professional background and the importance of understanding the literature version. Even if it's the same article, every time it changes hands, it can make a big difference. We should be sensitive.

True Story:
He Hui, a volunteer, has died, and the first person to tweet about it did not have a photograph of him
A photo of a volunteer surnamed Yang, however, led the reviewer to mistake it for a photo of the deceased.

About the team

A lot of content is recommended by people online
Q
Wen Jing: How many members do you have in your team at present? How does it work? How many members do you currently have on your team? How does it work?
Shao Tang: In fact, there is not necessarily a clear distinction between the team and the netizens. Many netizens will help us or offer suggestions spontaneously. I prefer to think of the site as a joint effort under the open collaboration of the Internet, not The work of a team. If you want to say relatively stable people, there are currently technical personnel, mainly responsible for the site's construction, maintenance and generation of article screenshots; someone is mainly responsible for external cooperation and reply to netizens. But it's not fixed, it's something people do when they have the time and the ability. We will be responsible for some of the media need to follow up, do daily article collection and archiving. In addition, if anyone finds good content or articles that we don't currently include, they will send them to the group for evaluation, to see if they should be included and to follow up.

Q
Wenjing: How did everyone join the team?
Shao Tang: I and another promoter is a good friend, he is related to the media professional, think I want to do something very meaningful, agreed. Some of them are my classmates or friends, and some of them I met online this time. They contacted us and offered to be volunteers. In addition there are many users, will help us archive articles, or tell us which media, articles worth paying attention to, or even improve the web.
Q
Wenjing: Another promoter with a professional background, how is he different from you in understanding the project from his professional point of view?
Shao Tang: we have different views on the classification of articles. He tends to break up the category of "nonfiction" into stories and personal narratives. But I don't think it's right to lump non fiction written by someone else with your own personal narrative. So for now, let's just stick with the current classification. He has a relatively strong sensitivity to the content of the report, can help us feel the changes in the report. On Valentine's Day, for example, there were many public posts like "love under a mask, " which we felt were of little value to the epidemic itself. But after discussing it with him, I decided to include it as a record of the current changes in media coverage.

About content

Personal narratives preserve voices outside the mainstream

Q
Wenjing: But many of Mimeng's contents are fictional, only its style is "non-fictional" . How is this "nonfiction" defined? What kind of in-depth reporting do you think is good in-depth reporting?
Shao Tang: I am not a professional, do not know the journalism and communication on the good "in-depth report" definition. From my personal point of view, I prefer the "can find new problems" article. Especially when the government introduced a new regulation, measures, can find the impact of these policies of the article. Because at this point in time, the authorities have yet to assess the concrete results of these policies, and these policies will indeed bring about changes to individuals, it is very important for the media to follow up and report on them as soon as possible.

But after reading a lot of articles, we found that most media will follow an event after it has been reported by other media or the government, and very few media can find the problem on their own. On the one hand, there are differences in the capacity and orientation of the media itself, on the other hand, "pointing out new problems" is dangerous in itself. These good reports are especially valuable because they are timely and critical in identifying problems that the authorities have not yet identified, and when the authorities have figured out a solution to the problem, we missed the moment when we needed the press the most.
Q
Wen Jing: in your catalogs, are there any reports, non-fiction and personal narrative media and public numbers in particular worth recommending?
Shao Tang: to in-depth report, this time Caixin Net and"Sanlian life weekly"do very well. Secondly, some financial media, including CAIJING magazine, first finance and its Yimagazine, DT finance are all good. Their content is not as Caixin, Sanlian as the front line, but rather integrated review, a macro perspective, but also a strong reflection. The quality of southern-related media such as southern weekend is relatively stable. Netease owns a Qingliu Studio, which, although reported less recently, has valuable content, writing about fake masks, Putian Department and other issues.

For Nonfiction Writing, people magazine is somewhere between reportage and nonfiction, with the most guaranteed quality; ifeng.com's living on earth and netease's living vings on earth public accounts are good, and they also publish personal accounts of contributors. The relatively well-known non-fictional public accounts include the true story program and the National Story Program, which are popular, but have a strong processing style.

There are also a number of independent journalists and self-media reports, non-fiction worthy of attention. For example, all the fish, which were collected by several independent journalists, are now mainly used for Daily News Summary; 17 Yunlin Street is also worth paying attention to. In terms of personal narrative, Fang Fang's blog, nitro beauty, grass roots fiction, and so on, can give us a new perspective. Some of the writing is there, some isn't, but it's all worth seeing.

Q
Wenjing: The personal narratives are more fragmented and the audience is smaller. How do you find these articles?
Shao Tang: I think in general, there are three channels: Douban, Weibo, public accounts. The personal narratives we include are mostly from public accounts, so they're relatively small. I think that public accounts have some limitations to personal narratives, because whether they are submitted to self-media platforms (such as people, human beings'lives) , or they are written by public accounts, need very strong professional sex and certain time, technical doorsill. Much of the personal narrative and expression takes place on Weibo, but the content is fragmented and complex, making it difficult to archive. One team did a micro blog pneumonia talk project, which gathered the content via a crawler and displayed it on the site. I think the point of our archives is to preserve more people's experiences, their stories, their ideas. It may not help them in the moment, but it will at least leave a record for more people to see.
Q
Wenjing: Do you think personal narration is helpful for us to understand the epidemic situation and its whole picture?
Shao Tang: I think it must be helpful. The personal narrative is very nuanced, with strong emotional tendencies. It is only when one is actually experiencing this that the impact of one's words can be felt. Media content is filtered and filtered, focusing on major events or areas. Outside of these events, what is the daily life of the average person, whether or not directly affected by the epidemic? It may be something relatively trivial and trivial, but it's also part of what's happening. In addition, we will gradually make a conscious effort to tap into the voices of vulnerable and minority groups, such as the voices of the disabled and the public accounts of social work organizations, which are rarely heard in the mainstream media, or are often stereotyped.

In the long run, reports and personal accounts can be used as historical data when future generations want to study the epidemic. The value of a personal narrative is that it preserves a rich and diverse perspective of voices from different occupations, classes, and genders that are rarely seen through official or mainstream channels.

Q
Wenjing: Does the personal narrative make us one-sided because the content is too emotional and touching? Do we need to be vigilant when we read?
Shao Tang: If is the media report, we hope it can see more comprehensively, and restore the true appearance. But a personal narrative can not be neutral, and that's what makes it valuable. Because this narrative only represents the author's own feelings, it is emotional and not necessarily "correct" .

We know very well that what we choose to say, what we don't say, what we do, and what we don't do, often depends on where we are. But I still don't think we need to pull away from ourselves when we read, and it would be nice if we could empathize with the author. Because those who speak out are more powerless, weaker individuals. It's easy for us to say, "that's just his word, " and "we can't take his word for it. ". But this time, in fact, in a way is to maintain some authority. If you really want to be "vigilant, " you should also be wary of more mainstream content, always asking "what was written and what wasn't written, why keep it, why delete it, " if you can, you might be able to counter some of the forces that make you one-sided.
Q
Wenjing: After reading a lot of painful words, do you feel Numb to similar content?
Shao Tang: Numbness is bound to happen, or most of the circumstances will not be as touched as the first time. But it's also possible that by seeing more of these things, you can rationally feel that the problem is too serious. For example, when the outbreak began, bed tension, we fully understand, there is no solution, so it will be more difficult. So, I think that as we read more, maybe our emotions will ebb away, but rationally we will know that these things are worth paying attention to.

About thinking

Maybe we're "preserving the memory of our time. "

Q
Wenjing: What are your plans for the future of the project? Do you want to gather more content or collaborate with other teams?
Shao Tang: first of all, I also hope to perfect our project. As we collect more and more content and the page becomes less readable, I'd like to address that first. Secondly, recently there are some translation team, we hope to include the article as much as possible into English, into an English friendship site.

If time and manpower allow me to deepen and expand the project, I would like to put together some critical and analytical articles such as those by Sophia Philosphy, Liu Shaohua, and Zhou Xueguang. Most of these articles can be spread very widely, but there is no a complete collation. I also want to do a literature-related collation, such as epidemic-related poetry, prose, novels and so on. Images and vlogs, for example, are so fragmented, hard to store, and hard to trace to their source, that they haven't been considered for curation.

Q
Wenjing: There are a lot of volunteers online to help in this epidemic, most of them after 909500. Do you think it is the mission of our generation to do this? Or to what extent do we, as witnesses, have a mission?
Shao Tang: I think "mission" is the era of the context of shaping, I do not care about the mission, sense of mission. As a witness, I think it makes sense to use my expertise to "keep information that the official narrative doesn't pay much attention to. ". This is my starting point, but also "should" to do things. You can think of this as a "mission, " but I don't think it's a collective thing. This is not an "US" mission. This is not a collective action.
Q
Wenjing: There is a saying that it is precisely because a lot of content can not be retained that the "selection team" quickly gain attention. What do you think of this "welfare" ?
Shao Tang: indeed. It is because a lot of articles published, soon can not read, we are more concerned about these do collation, archiving projects. From the E-mail to us, we can also see that everyone's understanding and interpretation of our project is "to preserve the memory of this era. ". On the one hand, if the authorities were more open to information, there would be no need for us to archive "articles that might not be seen" , and on the other hand, if the epidemic ended, our work would be put to rest.

The founder of A2n also said before, "when we get the most attention, it must be the most opaque information, the most serious epidemic, " I take this sentence with my team's friends. People replied, "hopefully, the outbreak will go down as we have since February 6th. ".

But because our technology doesn't allow full-time automatic archiving, we can't retrieve articles if they're unreadable by the time we see them, or if people don't archive them.

With respect to copyright, we try to avoid problems as much as possible. First of all, collate all the articles are currently free public online, no paid content, our site also has no business purposes. Second, we will not reprint the full text, but only give the source, attached links, close to a reference. And once we receive a complaint about copyright infringement from the author or the media, we will immediately withdraw the article and apologize.

Because at this point in time, the authorities have yet to assess the concrete results of these policies, and these policies will indeed bring about changes to individuals, it is very important for the media to follow up and report on them as soon as possible.

But after reading a lot of articles, we found that most media will follow an event after it has been reported by other media or the government, and very few media can find the problem on their own. On the one hand, there are differences in the capacity and orientation of the media itself, on the other hand, "pointing out new problems" is dangerous in itself. These good reports are especially valuable because they are timely and critical in identifying problems that the authorities have not yet identified, and when the authorities have figured out a solution to the problem, we missed the moment when we needed the press the most.

Q
Wen Jing: in your catalogs, are there any reports, non-fiction and personal narrative media and public numbers in particular worth recommending?

Wen Jing: in your catalogs, are there any reports, non-fiction and personal narrative media and public numbers in particular worth recommending?

Shao Tang: to in-depth report, this time Caixin Net and"Sanlian life weekly"do very well. Secondly, some financial media, including CAIJING magazine, first finance and its Yimagazine, DT finance are all good. Their content is not as Caixin, Sanlian as the front line, but rather integrated review, a macro perspective, but also a strong reflection. The quality of southern-related media such as southern weekend is relatively stable. Netease owns a Qingliu Studio, which, although reported less recently, has valuable content, writing about fake masks, Putian Department and other issues.

For Nonfiction Writing, people magazine is somewhere between reportage and nonfiction, with the most guaranteed quality; ifeng.com's living on earth and netease's living vings on earth public accounts are good, and they also publish personal accounts of contributors. The relatively well-known non-fictional public accounts include the true story program and the National Story Program, which are popular, but have a strong processing style.

There are also a number of independent journalists and self-media reports, non-fiction worthy of attention. For example, all the fish, which were collected by several independent journalists, are now mainly used for Daily News Summary; 17 Yunlin Street is also worth paying attention to. In terms of personal narrative, Fang Fang's blog, nitro beauty, grass roots fiction, and so on, can give us a new perspective. Some of the writing is there, some isn't, but it's all worth seeing.

Q
Wenjing: The personal narratives are more fragmented and the audience is smaller. How do you find these articles?

Wenjing: The personal narratives are more fragmented and the audience is smaller. How do you find these articles?

Shao Tang: I think in general, there are three channels: Douban, Weibo, public accounts. The personal narratives we include are mostly from public accounts, so they're relatively small. I think that public accounts have some limitations to personal narratives, because whether they are submitted to self-media platforms (such as people, human beings'lives) , or they are written by public accounts, need very strong professional sex and certain time, technical doorsill. Much of the personal narrative and expression takes place on Weibo, but the content is fragmented and complex, making it difficult to archive. One team did a micro blog pneumonia talk project, which gathered the content via a crawler and displayed it on the site. I think the point of our archives is to preserve more people's experiences, their stories, their ideas. It may not help them in the moment, but it will at least leave a record for more people to see.

Q
Wenjing: Do you think personal narration is helpful for us to understand the epidemic situation and its whole picture?

Wenjing: Do you think personal narration is helpful for us to understand the epidemic situation and its whole picture?

Shao Tang: I think it must be helpful. The personal narrative is very nuanced, with strong emotional tendencies. It is only when one is actually experiencing this that the impact of one's words can be felt. Media content is filtered and filtered, focusing on major events or areas. Outside of these events, what is the daily life of the average person, whether or not directly affected by the epidemic? It may be something relatively trivial and trivial, but it's also part of what's happening. In addition, we will gradually make a conscious effort to tap into the voices of vulnerable and minority groups, such as the voices of the disabled and the public accounts of social work organizations, which are rarely heard in the mainstream media, or are often stereotyped.

In the long run, reports and personal accounts can be used as historical data when future generations want to study the epidemic. The value of a personal narrative is that it preserves a rich and diverse perspective of voices from different occupations, classes, and genders that are rarely seen through official or mainstream channels.

Q
Wenjing: Does the personal narrative make us one-sided because the content is too emotional and touching? Do we need to be vigilant when we read?

Wenjing: Does the personal narrative make us one-sided because the content is too emotional and touching? Do we need to be vigilant when we read?

Shao Tang: If is the media report, we hope it can see more comprehensively, and restore the true appearance. But a personal narrative can not be neutral, and that's what makes it valuable. Because this narrative only represents the author's own feelings, it is emotional and not necessarily "correct" .

We know very well that what we choose to say, what we don't say, what we do, and what we don't do, often depends on where we are. But I still don't think we need to pull away from ourselves when we read, and it would be nice if we could empathize with the author. Because those who speak out are more powerless, weaker individuals. It's easy for us to say, "that's just his word, " and "we can't take his word for it. ". But this time, in fact, in a way is to maintain some authority. If you really want to be "vigilant, " you should also be wary of more mainstream content, always asking "what was written and what wasn't written, why keep it, why delete it, " if you can, you might be able to counter some of the forces that make you one-sided.

Q
Wenjing: After reading a lot of painful words, do you feel Numb to similar content?

Wenjing: After reading a lot of painful words, do you feel Numb to similar content?

Shao Tang: Numbness is bound to happen, or most of the circumstances will not be as touched as the first time. But it's also possible that by seeing more of these things, you can rationally feel that the problem is too serious. For example, when the outbreak began, bed tension, we fully understand, there is no solution, so it will be more difficult. So, I think that as we read more, maybe our emotions will ebb away, but rationally we will know that these things are worth paying attention to.

About thinking

Maybe we're "preserving the memory of our time. "

Q
Wenjing: What are your plans for the future of the project? Do you want to gather more content or collaborate with other teams?

Wenjing: What are your plans for the future of the project? Do you want to gather more content or collaborate with other teams?

Shao Tang: first of all, I also hope to perfect our project. As we collect more and more content and the page becomes less readable, I'd like to address that first. Secondly, recently there are some translation team, we hope to include the article as much as possible into English, into an English friendship site.

If time and manpower allow me to deepen and expand the project, I would like to put together some critical and analytical articles such as those by Sophia Philosphy, Liu Shaohua, and Zhou Xueguang. Most of these articles can be spread very widely, but there is no a complete collation. I also want to do a literature-related collation, such as epidemic-related poetry, prose, novels and so on. Images and vlogs, for example, are so fragmented, hard to store, and hard to trace to their source, that they haven't been considered for curation.

Q
Wenjing: There are a lot of volunteers online to help in this epidemic, most of them after 909500. Do you think it is the mission of our generation to do this? Or to what extent do we, as witnesses, have a mission?

Wenjing: There are a lot of volunteers online to help in this epidemic, most of them after 909500. Do you think it is the mission of our generation to do this? Or to what extent do we, as witnesses, have a mission?

Shao Tang: I think "mission" is the era of the context of shaping, I do not care about the mission, sense of mission. As a witness, I think it makes sense to use my expertise to "keep information that the official narrative doesn't pay much attention to. ". This is my starting point, but also "should" to do things. You can think of this as a "mission, " but I don't think it's a collective thing. This is not an "US" mission. This is not a collective action.

Q
Wenjing: There is a saying that it is precisely because a lot of content can not be retained that the "selection team" quickly gain attention. What do you think of this "welfare" ?

Wenjing: There is a saying that it is precisely because a lot of content can not be retained that the "selection team" quickly gain attention. What do you think of this "welfare" ?

Shao Tang: indeed. It is because a lot of articles published, soon can not read, we are more concerned about these do collation, archiving projects. From the E-mail to us, we can also see that everyone's understanding and interpretation of our project is "to preserve the memory of this era. ". On the one hand, if the authorities were more open to information, there would be no need for us to archive "articles that might not be seen" , and on the other hand, if the epidemic ended, our work would be put to rest.

The founder of A2n also said before, "when we get the most attention, it must be the most opaque information, the most serious epidemic, " I take this sentence with my team's friends. People replied, "hopefully, the outbreak will go down as we have since February 6th. ".
