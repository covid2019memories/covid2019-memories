Postgraduate Admission Test, class of 2020
I don't know how to plan for the future
New Year at home, to see the epidemic spread gradually, the media advised everyone not to go out of the news, I expected to take the post-graduate examination will be postponed. When I received the extension notice, I was in a mixed mood. The good news was that I had more time to prepare for the second interview. The bad news was that I felt more miserable.
The decision to take an examination of graduate school is because some meaning is difficult, I take an examination of college, could have been admitted to the province 985 schools, finally only admitted to a double non-college, so decided to take an examination of graduate school.
2019 postgraduate entrance examination after I began to prepare. In my senior year, I lived a life of my own. I get up at 7:30 every day, eat in the canteen, study in the library at 8:15, go back to the dormitory for a half hour nap at noon, then go back to the library to continue to study until 10:15 at night.
Studying for the graduate exam at home
In order to take an examination of grind, I cut off needless social intercourse and all hobby, the game that loves most also unloads. Sometimes really tired, from the inside out tired, feel that life is very boring.
One morning, I was having breakfast in the cafeteria, and suddenly I was so depressed and out of breath that I bought a movie ticket and went to see Natsume's Book of Friends alone in the morning. After reading just a little bit more comfortable in the mind, and quickly ran to review.
I'm a classic procrastinator, and it takes a deadline to push me to meet my goals. Now the specific arrangements of the second-round exam did not come out, I have less sense of urgency, there is no goal and motivation to learn.
This epidemic has made normal life so uncertain that the road signs that were supposed to be there are gone, so I procrastinate every day.
I can't go back to school because of the epidemic. Some review material on the school did not take home, review up is very limited. Award-winning certificates, transcripts are also put in the school, looking for a mentor is also more trouble.
Moreover, the second-round examination will be delayed into the graduation project, in time how to balance is also a problem. I need to read the literature, design model, optimization model and so on. The preparation of these processes is parallel to the preparation of the second test.
Now the specific time of the second interview and Graduation Project Related Notice has not been released, everything is unknown, I do not know how to plan the future, can only wait.
This period of time every night are insomnia, a closed eyes, the mind is filled with a post-graduate entrance examination, professional recruitment, graduate design and other things, very suffering. Just in case things went back to normal after the outbreak, and all the calls came in, and I didn't have time to get ready.
The mood is like that of an athlete waiting at the starting line for the gun to go off, his heart hanging in the air, only to hear it before he can start running, but the gun has not yet gone off.

Cai Zishan 2020 session of examination candidates
After the college entrance examination was postponed, I had a good cry
On the afternoon of February 8, a friend sent a message: "If I put off the exam for too long, I won't take it. After all, I will go home and work. There is no difference between a college and an undergraduate. "
I jokingly replied, "the joys and sorrows of mankind are really not the same. "
I have no way back home to work, also can not do her so free and easy, through the promotion of this exam is the only single wooden bridge in front of me.
I've been preparing for this exam for less than half a year, or more. In 2017, I was admitted from the county high school to major in accounting at the vocational school. Small County education resources are not good, many students and I, three years of hard can only be admitted to General University or junior college, after graduation to work in a hurry, few people continue to further education.
After entering the university, I often use Weibo and Zhihu. Sometimes I feel that I live in a different world from my peers on the Internet. I admire them for receiving an education in a famous school and having a broader vision. In addition to any company to recruit undergraduate degree or above, so I made early plans to participate in the college entrance examination.
During my freshman year, I seldom missed classes. During my sophomore year, I began to prepare for English very early. Because of my poor foundation and lack of money for extra-curricular tutoring, I had to insist on reading early, memorizing words and doing exercises every day in the most stupid way.
Sometimes see on-line some people say that the college entrance examination is very water, English is only four levels of difficulty, my heart unavoidably sad. Students like me, who come from the countryside, have to do everything they can to bridge the educational gap.

In order to pass the exam, I became a library regular, students often go out to go shopping break, I never participated. In fact, I am most envious of the holiday can do part-time people, one or two hundred dollars a day, can reduce a lot of burden for the family.

But at the beginning of February, speculation began to circulate in the exam preparation group that the exam might be postponed. At that time, there were various kinds of announcements of examination postponement, I do not know whether the promotion of this will be affected, if the postponement I have to deal with.
I struggled for days with uncertainty, searching every day for information about exams and outbreaks, hoping to wake up one day to find that the epidemic was completely over and business as usual.
After all, if the test postponed, all kinds of variables will increase, I am not sure whether I can hold the mentality, also do not know if the test, soon to graduate, I hold a diploma how to find a job.
February 8, students to the group sent a screenshot of the announcement, said that the test is determined to postpone the specific time has not been determined. I immediately ran to the computer, a notice on the admissions website on the crying.
I do not know what happened to myself, maybe days of uneasy finally wait for the result, maybe these days have been watching the news heart is too depressed, tears can not stop falling.
News from the group continued, some worried that if the delay was too long and the graduation crash, some complained that the delay in his next plan, still others said happily: "fortunately postponed, I have not yet finished memorizing. "
A friend asked me how I was feeling, what's the plan? I thought about it and could only tell her, "it's so sudden, it's a bit muddled, and I don't know what to do next. "
The sudden postponement of a certain examination time is like stepping down a flight of stairs with a sudden void in your heart. Preparation for such a long time, the examination in front of the eyes and disappeared, giving a feeling of emptiness, do not know where to grasp the handle.
That night, I thought for a long time, or in the friend circle sent a sentence: "Some people live in high-rise, some people in deep ditch, continue to work hard, can not turn back. "

Zhou Wanqing 2020 national civil servant examination candidates
After the outbreak, I wanted to be a civil servant
A few days ago wearing a mask running in the community, because I almost fainted because of inhalation. If it wasn't for this outbreak, I'd be training on the playground of a nearby high school.
I will graduate in June, and because my family works in the police, I have always felt a sense of justice in the police profession, so last October I applied for the National Civil Service Examination for a police post.
Compared with other police posts more than the physical assessment of this level, my physical quality is not good, not love sports since childhood, College Physical Test 800 meters is my annual nightmare. Because of this, when the test friends are surprised, but my family is very supportive.
After passing the written test on January 8, I began to train my physical ability in a planned way, preparing for the second round of interview in February, and then taking the physical ability test.
In mid-january, chatting with friends about "Wuhan Pneumonia" , we still feel this matter is very far away. Did Not expect more than 10 days later I suddenly received notice: The National Examination interview will be postponed.
Normally, interviews start in mid-february, but for now, the focus is on fighting the epidemic, and the timing of the new interviews is uncertain.
The previous review plan to reschedule, and do not know when the new interview notice will be issued, will be very sudden, do not know how much time to review, which makes me a little passive.
For this test, I started to prepare from the second semester of my junior year. I took a test in the morning, made an essay in the afternoon, took an analysis class in the evening. I could study for 10 hours every day. At the same time, I had to take time out to run.
One month my grades did not break through, the more I thought about the meal, the more afraid I suddenly cried. My family reassured me that the test was something I did my best, and that the first time was an experience. Their words gave me a great encouragement, mental stability down, the results have been a breakthrough gradually.
But now, because of the epidemic, I have to stay home, watch online classes, prepare for interviews, and do physical training with a mask on.
Figure | fitness training record
I now run almost three kilometers a day, sometimes plus 800 meters. Since the new exam announcement hasn't come out yet, and I don't know if the physical fitness test has changed, I still focus on long-distance running.
I also thought about what I would do if the interview failed, I think I will continue to take the civil service exam. I am a person who has decided that if I want to do something, I have to work hard to achieve it. I see this as a challenge and proof of my ability. I don't want to give up this choice because of one failure.

Zhang Leshan Former toefl examinee in March 2020
TOEFL, take the test in May. I have to hit the mark
The March toefl test is a part of my plan to study abroad for graduate school. If it is disrupted, the follow-up will cause a lot of trouble.
Study abroad this matter, on the one hand is the idea of home, on the other hand is my professional needs. I learned is the number of media television, whether the direction of future director, or Special Effects Direction, as well as production, marketing and so on, to study in the United States is the best choice.
In order to successfully enrolled in the ideal college, I began to prepare junior year. Language is a relatively difficult hurdle. In mid-october last year, I began preparing for the TOEFL test. I took the test for the first time in January this year. I wanted to first experience the test environment and real questions, and then, by comparing the results for the first time, reflect on which item needs to be focused on, which one needs only to be supplemented.
The ongoing toefl online course

The first test, I know their level and problems, and then applied for the toefl test in March, intend to the second time can go as high as high. To this end, I also signed up for the language classes to do a full sprint, in March to test a satisfactory score. If all goes well, then you'll have more time to prepare the rest of the application.
But as soon as this epidemic hit, exams were suspended all over the country.
In the middle of February, I saw ielts announced the cancellation of the exams in February and March. I was a little flustered at that time. I was afraid that toefl would be the same, but I still took a chance. Then a classmate told me that his toefl test in March had been canceled, and I felt bad, so I looked up TOEFL's test scores for April and May.
Fortunately, there was an examination place in early May, and I applied for it immediately. Not long after, toefl officials cancelled all exams for February and March. Now sign up, there is no place for the test in June.
I'm a little confused about this cancellation. Because in theory, from October to November this year, foreign schools will start sending out applications. If the previous plan, between March and May language preparation should be over, and the remaining half of the year can be more fully brush up internship experience and preparation of application materials.
In this situation, toefl test in May, I have to hit the nail on the head. Because the second half of the year I still need to take the most important undergraduate course, completed a 20-minute photography work, time-consuming, and internship at every two or three months, time is very tight.
Preparing for the TOEFL itself takes time. If you need to take the exam again after May, you will be under a lot of pressure.
Now I'm at home, I can't take the test, and my internship is over. Originally wanted to register for an off-line course, now also can only report on the line one-to-one language lesson, continue to study at home. My Language Foundation is not good, if not invested in a lot of time to consolidate and improve, is not able to get the ideal score.
I am the kind of person who likes to follow a plan step by step to complete, now the plan was delayed, do not know when to return to the track, or a little confused. But there is no other way, but to do the current thing first.

IELTS test takers March 2020
I was relieved to learn that IELTS's exams had been cancelled
The moment I found out that IELTS had been cancelled, I was almost subconsciously relieved that I wasn't ready.
On January 27, IELTS's official China website announced that all kinds of ielts tests from January 31 to February in mainland China had been cancelled due to the epidemic. At that time, I thought the March test might be affected as well. On February 14, the notice of cancelling the examination came down.
When I first started college, my parents whispered in my ear, "IELTS, toefl, you have to try it. " . They may not know the exact difference between these tests, but the children of my friends are taking them, and they're afraid I'll fall behind.
Plus the elder sister also said the earlier the better, I signed up for this year's IELTS, think no matter what, first try.
Around the students have the intention to go abroad, have been trying to prepare for the exam, many junior friends in the day in the community, internship unit work, come back in the evening, but also a variety of exercises, brush questions, listen to the net class, holidays have to live in the library. I heard that there are also elder sister because of continuous work, pressure is too big, straight fainted in the dormitory.

Compared with them, my test preparation life is much easier, brush exercises, practice oral English, rest when tired. I was only a sophomore, have not applied to the pressure of school, always feel that there is time, the next time again serious preparation is also in time.
But this outbreak has changed a lot of my thinking.
On the one hand, friends are wailing, some IELTS results fail, the school due date for the submission of materials, she applied for two exams in February, the results were cancelled, anxious not know how to do. Others have worked hard for a long time, only to be abruptly cancelled and are already studying to take their exams abroad.

Looking at their appearance, I can not avoid putting myself in, this time I dilly prepare for the exam, do not want to face their own results, but glad the exam was cancelled, do not have to face the reality. But if I'm also at a critical point in time, when the test was canceled, can I relax?
I always like to joke with friends before, they all think I special "mouth damage" , but this time I really know what is helpless. When a friend comes to complain to me, I will be patient to talk with them, and together with them to find a way.
On the other hand, things in Wuhan started to make me feel like a "survivor. ". Because I am not in Hubei, I am not sick, so every day for some small things happy, angry, and those who have no chance to leave.
Perhaps about the test of life, really not so much next time, I think or to seize every day seriously.

Cai Zishan 2020 session of examination candidates
After the college entrance examination was postponed, I had a good cry
On the afternoon of February 8, a friend sent a message: "If I put off the exam for too long, I won't take it. After all, I will go home and work. There is no difference between a college and an undergraduate. "
I jokingly replied, "the joys and sorrows of mankind are really not the same. "
I have no way back home to work, also can not do her so free and easy, through the promotion of this exam is the only single wooden bridge in front of me.
I've been preparing for this exam for less than half a year, or more. In 2017, I was admitted from the county high school to major in accounting at the vocational school. Small County education resources are not good, many students and I, three years of hard can only be admitted to General University or junior college, after graduation to work in a hurry, few people continue to further education.
After entering the university, I often use Weibo and Zhihu. Sometimes I feel that I live in a different world from my peers on the Internet. I admire them for receiving an education in a famous school and having a broader vision. In addition to any company to recruit undergraduate degree or above, so I made early plans to participate in the college entrance examination.
During my freshman year, I seldom missed classes. During my sophomore year, I began to prepare for English very early. Because of my poor foundation and lack of money for extra-curricular tutoring, I had to insist on reading early, memorizing words and doing exercises every day in the most stupid way.
Sometimes see on-line some people say that the college entrance examination is very water, English is only four levels of difficulty, my heart unavoidably sad. Students like me, who come from the countryside, have to do everything they can to bridge the educational gap.

In order to pass the exam, I became a library regular, students often go out to go shopping break, I never participated. In fact, I am most envious of the holiday can do part-time people, one or two hundred dollars a day, can reduce a lot of burden for the family.

But at the beginning of February, speculation began to circulate in the exam preparation group that the exam might be postponed. At that time, there were various kinds of announcements of examination postponement, I do not know whether the promotion of this will be affected, if the postponement I have to deal with.
I struggled for days with uncertainty, searching every day for information about exams and outbreaks, hoping to wake up one day to find that the epidemic was completely over and business as usual.
After all, if the test postponed, all kinds of variables will increase, I am not sure whether I can hold the mentality, also do not know if the test, soon to graduate, I hold a diploma how to find a job.
February 8, students to the group sent a screenshot of the announcement, said that the test is determined to postpone the specific time has not been determined. I immediately ran to the computer, a notice on the admissions website on the crying.
I do not know what happened to myself, maybe days of uneasy finally wait for the result, maybe these days have been watching the news heart is too depressed, tears can not stop falling.
News from the group continued, some worried that if the delay was too long and the graduation crash, some complained that the delay in his next plan, still others said happily: "fortunately postponed, I have not yet finished memorizing. "
A friend asked me how I was feeling, what's the plan? I thought about it and could only tell her, "it's so sudden, it's a bit muddled, and I don't know what to do next. "
The sudden postponement of a certain examination time is like stepping down a flight of stairs with a sudden void in your heart. Preparation for such a long time, the examination in front of the eyes and disappeared, giving a feeling of emptiness, do not know where to grasp the handle.
That night, I thought for a long time, or in the friend circle sent a sentence: "Some people live in high-rise, some people in deep ditch, continue to work hard, can not turn back. "

Zhou Wanqing 2020 national civil servant examination candidates
After the outbreak, I wanted to be a civil servant
A few days ago wearing a mask running in the community, because I almost fainted because of inhalation. If it wasn't for this outbreak, I'd be training on the playground of a nearby high school.
I will graduate in June, and because my family works in the police, I have always felt a sense of justice in the police profession, so last October I applied for the National Civil Service Examination for a police post.
Compared with other police posts more than the physical assessment of this level, my physical quality is not good, not love sports since childhood, College Physical Test 800 meters is my annual nightmare. Because of this, when the test friends are surprised, but my family is very supportive.
After passing the written test on January 8, I began to train my physical ability in a planned way, preparing for the second round of interview in February, and then taking the physical ability test.
In mid-january, chatting with friends about "Wuhan Pneumonia" , we still feel this matter is very far away. Did Not expect more than 10 days later I suddenly received notice: The National Examination interview will be postponed.
Normally, interviews start in mid-february, but for now, the focus is on fighting the epidemic, and the timing of the new interviews is uncertain.
The previous review plan to reschedule, and do not know when the new interview notice will be issued, will be very sudden, do not know how much time to review, which makes me a little passive.
For this test, I started to prepare from the second semester of my junior year. I took a test in the morning, made an essay in the afternoon, took an analysis class in the evening. I could study for 10 hours every day. At the same time, I had to take time out to run.
One month my grades did not break through, the more I thought about the meal, the more afraid I suddenly cried. My family reassured me that the test was something I did my best, and that the first time was an experience. Their words gave me a great encouragement, mental stability down, the results have been a breakthrough gradually.
But now, because of the epidemic, I have to stay home, watch online classes, prepare for interviews, and do physical training with a mask on.
Figure | fitness training record
I now run almost three kilometers a day, sometimes plus 800 meters. Since the new exam announcement hasn't come out yet, and I don't know if the physical fitness test has changed, I still focus on long-distance running.
I also thought about what I would do if the interview failed, I think I will continue to take the civil service exam. I am a person who has decided that if I want to do something, I have to work hard to achieve it. I see this as a challenge and proof of my ability. I don't want to give up this choice because of one failure.

Zhang Leshan Former toefl examinee in March 2020
TOEFL, take the test in May. I have to hit the mark
The March toefl test is a part of my plan to study abroad for graduate school. If it is disrupted, the follow-up will cause a lot of trouble.
Study abroad this matter, on the one hand is the idea of home, on the other hand is my professional needs. I learned is the number of media television, whether the direction of future director, or Special Effects Direction, as well as production, marketing and so on, to study in the United States is the best choice.
In order to successfully enrolled in the ideal college, I began to prepare junior year. Language is a relatively difficult hurdle. In mid-october last year, I began preparing for the TOEFL test. I took the test for the first time in January this year. I wanted to first experience the test environment and real questions, and then, by comparing the results for the first time, reflect on which item needs to be focused on, which one needs only to be supplemented.
The ongoing toefl online course

The first test, I know their level and problems, and then applied for the toefl test in March, intend to the second time can go as high as high. To this end, I also signed up for the language classes to do a full sprint, in March to test a satisfactory score. If all goes well, then you'll have more time to prepare the rest of the application.
But as soon as this epidemic hit, exams were suspended all over the country.
In the middle of February, I saw ielts announced the cancellation of the exams in February and March. I was a little flustered at that time. I was afraid that toefl would be the same, but I still took a chance. Then a classmate told me that his toefl test in March had been canceled, and I felt bad, so I looked up TOEFL's test scores for April and May.
Fortunately, there was an examination place in early May, and I applied for it immediately. Not long after, toefl officials cancelled all exams for February and March. Now sign up, there is no place for the test in June.
I'm a little confused about this cancellation. Because in theory, from October to November this year, foreign schools will start sending out applications. If the previous plan, between March and May language preparation should be over, and the remaining half of the year can be more fully brush up internship experience and preparation of application materials.
In this situation, toefl test in May, I have to hit the nail on the head. Because the second half of the year I still need to take the most important undergraduate course, completed a 20-minute photography work, time-consuming, and internship at every two or three months, time is very tight.
Preparing for the TOEFL itself takes time. If you need to take the exam again after May, you will be under a lot of pressure.
Now I'm at home, I can't take the test, and my internship is over. Originally wanted to register for an off-line course, now also can only report on the line one-to-one language lesson, continue to study at home. My Language Foundation is not good, if not invested in a lot of time to consolidate and improve, is not able to get the ideal score.
I am the kind of person who likes to follow a plan step by step to complete, now the plan was delayed, do not know when to return to the track, or a little confused. But there is no other way, but to do the current thing first.

In this situation, toefl test in May, I have to hit the nail on the head. Because the second half of the year I still need to take the most important undergraduate course, completed a 20-minute photography work, time-consuming, and internship at every two or three months, time is very tight.
Preparing for the TOEFL itself takes time. If you need to take the exam again after May, you will be under a lot of pressure.
Now I'm at home, I can't take the test, and my internship is over. Originally wanted to register for an off-line course, now also can only report on the line one-to-one language lesson, continue to study at home. My Language Foundation is not good, if not invested in a lot of time to consolidate and improve, is not able to get the ideal score.
I am the kind of person who likes to follow a plan step by step to complete, now the plan was delayed, do not know when to return to the track, or a little confused. But there is no other way, but to do the current thing first.

TOEFL, take the test in May. I have to hit the mark

The March toefl test is a part of my plan to study abroad for graduate school. If it is disrupted, the follow-up will cause a lot of trouble.

Study abroad this matter, on the one hand is the idea of home, on the other hand is my professional needs. I learned is the number of media television, whether the direction of future director, or Special Effects Direction, as well as production, marketing and so on, to study in the United States is the best choice.

In order to successfully enrolled in the ideal college, I began to prepare junior year. Language is a relatively difficult hurdle. In mid-october last year, I began preparing for the TOEFL test. I took the test for the first time in January this year. I wanted to first experience the test environment and real questions, and then, by comparing the results for the first time, reflect on which item needs to be focused on, which one needs only to be supplemented.

The ongoing toefl online course

The first test, I know their level and problems, and then applied for the toefl test in March, intend to the second time can go as high as high. To this end, I also signed up for the language classes to do a full sprint, in March to test a satisfactory score. If all goes well, then you'll have more time to prepare the rest of the application.

But as soon as this epidemic hit, exams were suspended all over the country.

In the middle of February, I saw ielts announced the cancellation of the exams in February and March. I was a little flustered at that time. I was afraid that toefl would be the same, but I still took a chance. Then a classmate told me that his toefl test in March had been canceled, and I felt bad, so I looked up TOEFL's test scores for April and May.

Fortunately, there was an examination place in early May, and I applied for it immediately. Not long after, toefl officials cancelled all exams for February and March. Now sign up, there is no place for the test in June.

I'm a little confused about this cancellation. Because in theory, from October to November this year, foreign schools will start sending out applications. If the previous plan, between March and May language preparation should be over, and the remaining half of the year can be more fully brush up internship experience and preparation of application materials.

In this situation, toefl test in May, I have to hit the nail on the head. Because the second half of the year I still need to take the most important undergraduate course, completed a 20-minute photography work, time-consuming, and internship at every two or three months, time is very tight.

Preparing for the TOEFL itself takes time. If you need to take the exam again after May, you will be under a lot of pressure.

Now I'm at home, I can't take the test, and my internship is over. Originally wanted to register for an off-line course, now also can only report on the line one-to-one language lesson, continue to study at home. My Language Foundation is not good, if not invested in a lot of time to consolidate and improve, is not able to get the ideal score.

I am the kind of person who likes to follow a plan step by step to complete, now the plan was delayed, do not know when to return to the track, or a little confused. But there is no other way, but to do the current thing first.

IELTS test takers March 2020
I was relieved to learn that IELTS's exams had been cancelled
The moment I found out that IELTS had been cancelled, I was almost subconsciously relieved that I wasn't ready.
On January 27, IELTS's official China website announced that all kinds of ielts tests from January 31 to February in mainland China had been cancelled due to the epidemic. At that time, I thought the March test might be affected as well. On February 14, the notice of cancelling the examination came down.
When I first started college, my parents whispered in my ear, "IELTS, toefl, you have to try it. " . They may not know the exact difference between these tests, but the children of my friends are taking them, and they're afraid I'll fall behind.
Plus the elder sister also said the earlier the better, I signed up for this year's IELTS, think no matter what, first try.
Around the students have the intention to go abroad, have been trying to prepare for the exam, many junior friends in the day in the community, internship unit work, come back in the evening, but also a variety of exercises, brush questions, listen to the net class, holidays have to live in the library. I heard that there are also elder sister because of continuous work, pressure is too big, straight fainted in the dormitory.

Compared with them, my test preparation life is much easier, brush exercises, practice oral English, rest when tired. I was only a sophomore, have not applied to the pressure of school, always feel that there is time, the next time again serious preparation is also in time.
But this outbreak has changed a lot of my thinking.
On the one hand, friends are wailing, some IELTS results fail, the school due date for the submission of materials, she applied for two exams in February, the results were cancelled, anxious not know how to do. Others have worked hard for a long time, only to be abruptly cancelled and are already studying to take their exams abroad.

Looking at their appearance, I can not avoid putting myself in, this time I dilly prepare for the exam, do not want to face their own results, but glad the exam was cancelled, do not have to face the reality. But if I'm also at a critical point in time, when the test was canceled, can I relax?
I always like to joke with friends before, they all think I special "mouth damage" , but this time I really know what is helpless. When a friend comes to complain to me, I will be patient to talk with them, and together with them to find a way.
On the other hand, things in Wuhan started to make me feel like a "survivor. ". Because I am not in Hubei, I am not sick, so every day for some small things happy, angry, and those who have no chance to leave.
Perhaps about the test of life, really not so much next time, I think or to seize every day seriously.
