With the outbreak of new coronavirus pneumonia in the world, the international oil market has brought new uncertainty.

”

Gas Station owner Zhen Rong's depression finally eased some.

"yesterday, gasoline sales at gas stations began to rise, " Zhen Rong told interface news on Feb. 23. From the Spring Festival to mid-february, daily gasoline sales at his gas stations dropped to 10 percent, down from 20 percent before the holiday, sales are back to 30% of pre-holiday levels.

In Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, Zhen runs five private gas stations. Affected by the epidemic, traffic control around the Spring Festival strict, people go out less, his gas station doors can be empty.

Zhen Rong can only stay at home, while watching the progress of the epidemic, while watching the traffic situation.

On February 24th the Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China reported that, as of February 23rd, 27 provinces had resumed inter provincial passenger or charter services in an orderly manner. A total of 110 prefecture-level cities, 137 county-level cities to resume ground bus operations. 67.8% of cities nationwide continue to provide full ground bus services.

For Zhen Rong, this is good news, the haze that encloses in the heart nearly a month begins to fade gradually.

###Plummeting sales and production rates

The outbreak hit not only private gas stations but also state-owned oil companies.

"In January, petrochina's sales of refined oil products fell 18 percent year-on-year. From January 25 to 30, the average daily sales volume of refined oil products was 58 percent lower than the monthly plan and nearly 60 percent lower than the 24-day sales volume. " Tang Tingchuan, director of strategy and policy at the Policy Research Office of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) , said at the "extraordinary events series live online conference" at the CIPPE Zhenwei international oil show.

Sinopec, China's largest seller of refined oil products, said its January operating volume was 14.03 million tons, down 12.7 percent from a year earlier.

Affected by the epidemic, the international oil price fell sharply in a short time. On February 10, Brunt and WTI hit their lowest levels in almost a year, closing at $53.27 and $49.57, respectively, down 22.7 per cent and 21.7 per cent from their January 6 highs.

Domestic refined oil sales prices fell as a result. Since February, domestic gasoline and diesel retail prices have been reduced twice. After the "double-dip" , gasoline prices fell 835 yuan / ton this year, diesel prices fell 805 yuan / ton.

Wholesale prices of refined oil products are no exception. According to Jinlianchuang data, as of February 21, the average wholesale price of 0 diesel was 6,245 yuan / ton, representing a 6.71% month-on-month decrease; the average wholesale price of 92 was 6,333 yuan / ton, representing a 7.07% month-on-month decrease; and the average wholesale price of 95 was 6,671 yuan / ton, representing a 6.79% month-on-month decrease.

Natural gas consumption has also been affected and inventories are rising. According to Tang, CNPC's daily sales of natural gas from January 25 to 30 were 40-50 million cubic meters lower than planned due to the shutdown of industrial users, which is expected to remain at the current level until they resume work.

In the same period, CNPC's pipeline network inventory was 0.6 billion cubic meters higher than the target pipeline inventory, and LNG receiving station gasification volume decreased from 50 million cubic meters per day to about 16 million cubic meters per day.

Natural gas prices have fallen sharply. According to Zhuochuang information, the average price of LNG in China was 3,375.79 yuan / ton as of February 18, down 22.59% year-on-year, and the price of some provincial networks dropped 10% .

LNG off-the-shelf reaches record low. As of February 17, the average price of LNG from China, Japan and South Korea was $2.82 per million British heat, of which the average price of LNG from China was $2.82 per million British heat, or 1,025.75 yuan per ton, down 72.7 percent year on year.

From the consumption terminal upward extension, whether "three barrels of oil" refining and chemical business, or Shandong local refineries, operating rates have hit a new low.

On February 25, the monitoring data of Gold Union Chong, a commodities consultancy, showed that the impact of the epidemic was compounded by the planned overhaul of some refineries. In February, the average operating rate of major domestic refineries dropped to around 70 percent, a drop of nearly 13 percentage points from the previous month The average operating rate of local refineries fell below 40 per cent, down more than 20 percentage points from the previous month.

"The oil and gas sales terminals and refining sector have been affected more vertically than the industry. However, from a horizontal perspective, the impact on the oil and gas industry is normal under the background that all industries, especially the service industry, have been greatly impacted,"Yue Laiqun, former deputy chief engineer of the oil and gas center of the Ministry of Natural Resources, told interface news.

###Oil and gas, masks and vegetables

At present, the oil and gas industry upstream exploration and development areas suffered the smallest impact. "three barrels of oil" oil and gas production is relatively stable.

On Feb. 21, an employee at petrochina Changqing oil field told an interface reporter that the oil and gas field was operating smoothly, but due to factors such as traffic control and 14-day isolation, the employee rework rate was low, increasing the work intensity of the employees on duty.

Upstream exploration operations, such as drilling, have been largely unaffected. As in previous cycles, drilling operations in the north did not begin on a large scale until March, when the weather warmed and the ground thawed, while in the south they waited until after the rainy season.

According to Tang Tingchuan, in the crude oil business chain, petrochina will continue to vigorously enhance exploration and development efforts to ensure the normal production of oil and gas fields.

As petrochina's largest oil and gas field, Changqing oil field this year's production target of 60 million tons. During the Spring Festival, the Changqing oilfield produced about 135 million cubic meters of natural gas per day, and the daily sales volume of natural gas exceeded the planned 4.12 million cubic meters. Total natural gas production, daily output and external supply are all at record highs.

Sinopec's oil and gas production has also been growing. In January, Sinopec produced 2.98 million tons of crude oil, unchanged from a year earlier, and 2.62 billion cubic meters of natural gas, up 5.7 percent from a year earlier.

On February 12,00883.HK  announced that the Bozhong 34-9 oil field was in production. The field is expected to peak production of more than 22,500 barrels per day by 2022.

"The production of oil and gas fields needs continuity and stability, and in general it is very difficult to shut down wells and limit production, otherwise it will be very difficult to resume production, " said Liu Yijun, deputy director of the China University of Petroleum, although the current decline in oil consumption is large, but this is only a short-term factor.

"In a volatile and complex international situation, China must increase the supply of domestic oil and gas resources to ensure energy security, which is the general trend, " Liu said.

Early last year, the "three barrels of oil" have stepped up domestic exploration and development of the "seven-year Action Plan. Subsequently, the domestic oil and gas exploration and development in the field of success. In 2019, China's crude oil production ended three years of decline and gained 191 million tons.

The 2019 domestic and foreign oil and Gas Industry Development Report, released by the China Academy of Petroleum Economics and technology, predicts that domestic crude oil production will reach 194 million tons in 2020, up 1.57 percent from the same period last year, due to further achievements in increasing domestic reserves and increasing production.

In the face of the epidemic, the upstream enterprise's work is "unshakable" . However, Yue is worried that if the epidemic will continue for some time, the domestic refining and petrochemical operation rate is still low, and the final consumption of oil products is low, then the oil and gas resources "hold-in reservoir, hold-in pipe" phenomenon will be more serious.

This is one of the problems that worries oil companies. In response to the impact of the "Black Swan" , oil companies have taken a number of steps.

Tang said the company was now strictly controlling imports of crude oil from the sea, taking measures such as ordering less, delaying deliveries and international reselling, and strictly controlling the production of refined oil products, as well as trying to expand the export of refined oil products and arranging shipping dates in advance.

According to Jinlianchuang monitoring data show that the current domestic gasoline and diesel export profit is considerable, refinery export enthusiasm is high. The first batch of refined oil export quotas issued in 2020 totaled 28 million tons, up 30.27 percent year-on-year.
For the Natural Gas Business, "CNPC has reduced its production capacity from 74 million cubic meters per day to 40 million cubic meters per day, " Tang said, the force majeure of the outbreak was scaled back.

According to Jinlianchuang monitoring data show that the current domestic gasoline and diesel export profit is considerable, refinery export enthusiasm is high. The first batch of refined oil export quotas issued in 2020 totaled 28 million tons, up 30.27 percent year-on-year.

For the Natural Gas Business, "CNPC has reduced its production capacity from 74 million cubic meters per day to 40 million cubic meters per day, " Tang said, the force majeure of the outbreak was scaled back.

In addition, CNPC has delayed the arrival time of imported LNG carriers, continued to use receiving stations for adjustment, strengthened communication and coordination with downstream users, and made preparations for the resumption of work by chemical fertilizer and chemical enterprises, with a view to further increasing sales.

In addition to normal oil and gas production, the oil company also expanded the production capacity of epidemic prevention materials, medical supplies, supplies of raw materials for killing supplies. It has also been a hot topic for oil companies in recent days.

Sinopec, the largest supplier of medical and health materials with an annual output of nearly one million tons, said on Feb. 6 that the company has put 15,000 tons of medical and health raw materials such as polypropylene on the market, and expects to continue producing about 80,000 tons of raw materials in February, and will increase the supply of disinfectant raw materials. Polypropylene is an important raw material for masks.

Some of petrochina's refining and chemical enterprises have also begun to shift production, upgrade and expand production. As of February 9, petrochina has produced a cumulative 64,300 tons of raw materials for medical use.

At the sales end of refined oil products, "two barrels of oil" to expand the non-oil business, the first in some provinces and cities convenience stores selling vegetables. Sinopec Beijing Petroleum Branch and petrochina Liaoning Sales Anshan have launched green vegetable packages at their gas stations.

In the sales model, "two barrels of oil" also began to use gas do not get off, not into the shop, shopping do not touch the way.

###Changes after the outbreak

The inflection point of the new crown epidemic has not yet arrived, but experts in the industry generally believe that the impact of the epidemic on international oil prices and domestic oil and gas markets is short-term and limited.

At the CIPE Zhenwei International Oil Exhibition's live broadcast meeting on February 23, "oil enterprises in action in times of war and epidemic situation" , Liu Chaoquan, vice president of the China Petroleum Economic and Technological Research Institute, predicted that after the epidemic, the international average price of crude oil remained between $57 and $64 per barrel.

"international oil prices were affected in the first quarter by about $3 per barrel below expectations, but will gradually rebound over the next three quarters as a result of proactive policies, " Liu Chao said.

Some agencies also believe that the outbreak in Iran, Iraq, Italy, South Korea and other countries in the past week will bring new uncertainty to the international oil market, the need to re-evaluate the impact of the epidemic on the market.

South Korea is the fourth largest oil market in Asia, Italy is the fifth largest in Europe and Iran is the second largest in the Middle East, IHS Markit, a global provider of business information services, said Feb. 25. Coupled with China's crude oil demand, about 20% of the world's crude oil demand, is facing the new crown disease test.

On Feb. 24, oil prices fell sharply after several days of gains, with Brent Crude futures falling more than 5 percent at one point. WTI crude for April delivery fell 3.65% to $51.43 a barrel in China Standard Time Trading, while Brent Crude fell 3.76% to $56.30 a barrel.

The impact of the epidemic on international oil prices is uncertain, but the huge impact on small and medium-sized oil and gas chemical enterprises has been formed. Longzhong information on more than 1500 energy and chemical enterprises survey found that although the resumption of good business conditions, but there are still more challenges.

For example, insufficient demand for products has led to reduced orders and revenue for enterprises, limited availability of warehousing, logistics and transportation personnel, slow recovery of production capacity, and increased cost and capital pressure on enterprises, the uncertainty in the evolution of the epidemic situation affects the production arrangement of the enterprises.

"The company is ready for the winter, " said Yan Jiantao, deputy general manager and Chief Strategy Officer of Longzhong Information, the enterprises surveyed expect the government to give them periodic tax support and implement tax reduction and rebate.

Enterprises also hope to get financial support, ease the pressure of funds, as well as gradually improve the warehousing and transportation links, strengthen the flow and so on.

At a State Council Information Office press conference on Feb. 24, National Development and Reform Commission Group member and Secretary General Cong Liang said that powerful and effective hedging policies have been put in place by various departments and departments. For example, it will reduce the cost of energy used by enterprises; set up a special reloan of 300 billion yuan to provide low-interest funds for key enterprises in the prevention and Control of materials; and reduce or waive social insurance premiums for enterprises and medical insurance premiums for employees at a certain stage, the value-added tax and income tax will be reduced or exempted for some industries and individuals.

"after the epidemic, there will be new mergers and reorganizations, and the number is expected to be higher than that of the year before and last year. The small and medium enterprises should make good use of state policies, " Liu advised, especially making good use of financial instruments.

In addition, the end of product oil sales will pay more attention to the online service model. Yan Jiantao believes that the sales of refined oil products will gradually move from offline to online, and it is a big trend to build more oil and gas trading platforms; facing the consumer's business, it will enter more and more white-hot competition.

As soon as possible to improve the emergency supplies reserve system, enterprises have also become an important task to strengthen management.

Tang Tingchuan suggested that enterprises should systematically sort out the shortcomings of the emergency supplies reserve system exposed by the outbreak, the working mechanism and contingency plan should be improved continuously from the aspects of the scale structure, production organization ability, source and channel of emergency materials.
