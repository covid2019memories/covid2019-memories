Morning Window ventilation, the opposite balcony is full of breathable residents, standing full of people, men mostly in the smoke daze, women took advantage of the sun, hang up clothes drying quilt, also saw an aunt playing music Tai Chi, eyes closed intoxicated with it. I also told my mother that now everyone is showing their magic powers. I also saw a man playing basketball in his room. When I looked again, I saw that he was playing with the children. He was holding the children up and down. I remembered that one night my mother accompanied me downstairs to get food, holding a dog to breathe together, the property staff saw my mother holding a "living thing" , wondering why so late still hold down the hair (baby) , we laughed directly.

A few years ago, I saw a link in a group where Jiangmen supported Wuhan. I could get a tin of dried tangerine or Puer tea by filling in my address and contact information. The limit was 10,000 cans. I submitted my application, expecting no tea, and then forgot about it. Yesterday, SF contacted me with a courier, I thought it was a subscription magazine, see the packaging on the word "Chinese Medicine" , confused, eyes muddled, do not know when they bought Chinese Medicine Online. It happened that the tea is a cylinder tin can, feel quite like a medicine bottle, I take home with half a doubt, open to suddenly realize that it is years ago applied for tea. The package also contained a letter from Tangerine or Orange Peel village to Wuhan, expressing the hope that the epidemic would pass as soon as possible, refueling in Wuhan, waiting for the closure of the city to be lifted and spring flowers to bloom, welcoming Wuhan residents to visit Jiangmen. After reading, I really want to go to the Tangerine Peel village. The letter introduces that the Tangerine Peel of their village is very famous. Pu'er tea is also sealed in the whole Tangerine Peel. It absorbs the fragrance of the peel. I like to eat sour things. As long as the Tangerine Peel and Hawthorn fruit are opened, I can not stop, if there are other delicious Tangerine Peel village better, Taobao help farmers, support them.

Our community residents may be too boring, yesterday because the group purchase of a few bags of flour quarreled all day long. Some people take too much hot and dry noodles, some people take the wide powder into noodles, some people think it is very unsanitary to throw the noodles directly onto the ground, some people think that the goods do not match the edition and ask for a refund. Everyone has been chattering and struggling all day, and in the evening they have not come to a unanimous conclusion, finally, our community simply to a "one-size-fits-all" , property in the middle of the coordination is also impatient, the last notice to stop any group purchase, we do not go out, a total of difficult times, what to eat, and so on the 10th to say, there are special circumstances (the elderly legs inconvenience, the baby needs milk powder, medicine to eat) and property contact.

Artemisia LANCEA, a beauty blogger who follows facebook, shared her thoughts the other day about the emergency fund. Money is for her, first, security, second, independence, third, freedom, and fourth, quality of life. She thinks one of the reasons people are spending more than they should is that they are too optimistic about their way of life. Whatever happens, I will enjoy it first. I don't think about how I will live in the future. When the epidemic strikes, it will pull us out of our stable lives, young, single men and women and those who marry and have children are also in two different situations, with the latter being more stressed and potentially more vulnerable to risk. Al Felt that a six month to one year security reserve would be appropriate, divided into four parts: Full Life, on demand products, funds available on a trading day, and cash hard currency gold. I think for me, according to the current wage level and spending, save 6-8 months is relatively reasonable and feasible, as long as it is not a natural disaster, about half a year cycle can ease up. My Algorithm is a bit rough, suddenly laid off, guaranteed to eat and drink, rent, water and electricity to pay, basic consumption on the line.

A few stray cats came running into the neighborhood. Yesterday, they went downstairs to pick up food, and they packed a bowl of ham sausage for the children. When I went to the gate to get food, I saw a small black cat with a very good-looking body. It was only about four or five months old. It had pure black hair, slender tail, Emerald Green Eyes, I was a moment this black cat's beauty hit, want to take a closer look at him (even move him to abduct home "evil thoughts") , black cat is very alert, immediately ran to the undercarriage hide.

Later I went downstairs and found this little black cat's father (guess) , the big black cat is also very beautiful, gills fat, smooth coat, ears and buttocks are very clean. Big Cat relatives, have been neutered, is abandoned by the owner of the cat, watching the black cat on the ground rubbing hair, I feel sad, stray cat life is short, domestic cats are often abandoned after the fight against native wildcats, vulnerable, higher mortality rate, such a cute cat is too good for an irresponsible owner.

I was talking to the hospital yesterday about the cat's health, and I did the math along the way. It was 42 days in foster care, 50 yuan a day, not including the cost of cat food and kitty litter. My friends complained that I wasn't in foster care, I was paying someone to have a cat. Will the cat know you by then, i thought about his usual look of disgust, as well as his family after I taught him the way, most of it is the state of happy.

The epidemic in Japan and South Korea is getting worse and worse. The blogger who studied abroad in Tokyo said that toilet paper was out of stock in supermarkets and rice was restricted. Ordinary people began to hoard grain to avoid going out. She was about to graduate and had been looking forward to the Cherry blossom in March, parents invited to graduation, cancelled. Closed to in-house students only. Some time ago, her school held a graduation project exhibition. The works that everyone had worked for a long time were placed on the exhibition platform. No one appreciated them. Only the teachers and other students interacted with each other. The exhibition was silent all day, was the saddest graduation ceremony their school had seen in years. I hope Japan can control the epidemic as soon as possible, the Tokyo Olympic Games will be held normally, I want to see the athletes of various countries compete, I want to see the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony, I want to see the energetic mascots, I have a lot of expectations for this Olympic Games, reluctant to postpone / Change / cancel.

In the latest issue of the Bof, we interviewed Christian Louboutin, the famous red-soled shoe. Louboutin said, "women wear clothes, shoes carry women. " "You can design clothes, not shoes. ". Most of his designs are 10 cm stiletto heels, which require a higher level of structure to support a woman to walk, not to be immobile, and to modify the shape of her legs to make them look longer. Louboutin is also a strong supporter of artisans, he comes from a family of artisans himself, so he has a lot of respect for the craftsman. As for the reason for choosing red, he said that the original pair of shoes were all black, because the buyer did not like colored things, he thought that green and yellow were the only colors, and adding a little red to the shoes did not count. I thought that red-soled shoes were beautiful, and the height was too scary, i wouldn't have been able to walk in it.

Speaking of big Red, The latest issue of Household Name is also about Red, The Red M & M Scare, The brief disappearance of Red M & M's. In the 1970s and 1980s, M & M's chocolate beans didn't have red beans, and because of several Russian studies on mice, consumers across the United States were gripped by fears that eating red pigments could cause cancer and lead to infertility, coupled with tensions between the United States and Russia, consumers have added a layer of filter to the color red. Soft serve ice cream, cured meats and aquatic products, confectionery... the red pigment permeates almost every aspect of life, but ironically, M & M's red chocolate beans don't use the same pigment for safety reasons, the brand stopped producing red M & M's until consumers began calling for the return of red beans, saying, "without red, M & M'S ARE JUST PLAIN DARK M & M's, " too loudly, m & M took the opportunity to turn the red beans back into a successful marketing campaign.

Flash Forward did a retrospective, integrating mosquito eradication, UBI benefits, and COVID-19, with an episode called The Sleeping Lion, imagining what The world would be like if China supplanted The United States as The Global Center and Hegemon, several academics interviewed said there was no need to worry about it (still confident) , but assuming that this nonexistent future can help us reflect on what is worth improving right now, the show's analysis of Belt and Road's relationship with Africa is worth listening to.

I read an article about "the heart of knowing things" , the main idea is to learn to understand each other, empathy, would have been a good thing, human, but the Japanese aristocratic circle of "know things" into a burden on women. For example, if a man asks a woman to marry him, even if she has no interest in it, she can not simply say no, because she is not in the mood for understanding a man's love. If she brutally refuses to accept a man's love, she is saying that she is a rock, uncouth woman. So as an aristocratic woman, from an early age, she received strict discipline. Even if she had no love for the man, she could not directly refuse him. She had to go back and forth several times to make it seem as if she wanted to refuse him, and then insinuate something in a roundabout way so that the man would not lose face completely, find a way out. This custom was not confined to ancient Japan. Until now, similar "rituals" have permeated all aspects of society in East Asia, no matter how high or low they are. Women have to keep a straight face if they want to refuse outright, a slight smile can easily be interpreted as a "desire to speak or not to speak" .

Recently, I began to watch Korean TV drama law, introducing mysterious Yōkai, there are also online gifs, the first night in the dark, watching in bed, scared my heart out of my head, and my mother tried to make sure it wasn't scary at all, I finally watched four episodes, i don't think it's scary, sometimes it's just the music, it's scary, when the witch is dancing, it's on silent + double speed, it's like a ghost video. The season 2 of Kingdom comes online on March 13 on Netflix, and this is the perfect time to catch a Zombie flick.

Another Week of wind and rain in Wuhan, the driest drizzle, either like the summer, when the big rainstorm comes and goes, or like the winter, when the dry skin explodes, and the spring rain always drags on, like the tangled and Furry Virgo (no black meaning, may be closed too long, feeling upset, everything can be angry, good end of the next rain I am not happy) , go to the property in the afternoon to get free supplies, the window looked that the weather is fine, go downstairs to find that the rain is not small, do not want to turn back to take an umbrella, all the way running, midway did not pay attention to look down the road, a foot into the puddle, the nameless resentment of the Spring Rain Greater.
