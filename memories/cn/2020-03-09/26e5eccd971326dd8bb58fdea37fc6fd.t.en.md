The medical and health authorities and researchers started early and informed the public as soon as possible. At the same time, they learned from the experience during the SARS epidemic, and paid particular attention to nosocomial infections, this is the Hong Kong SAR of China to fight the new Crown Epidemic is commendable.

"We are very careful in our discussions about the dangers of second-guessing. Therefore, in studying every event, we try to put ourselves in the shoes of those who know what they can do at the time. It's easiest to get the information afterwards and then criticize it."

It began with a report by 11 experts, led by the Hong Kong SAR government. The report, called lessons learned, is a summary of the experience of fighting the SARS epidemic in 2003, when Zhong Nanshan, director of the Atypical pneumonia, was one of the experts.

17 years later, the streets of Hong Kong, the city is still lively, people flow shuttle, the city as usual. But with 7.45 million people in a compact, densely populated city, infectious disease control is a challenge.

As of 8:00 p.m. on 8 March 2020, a total of 115 cases of new coronavirus pneumonia had been reported in Hong Kong SAR of China. Among them, 114 cases were confirmed and 1 case was suspected. This is much better than during SARS. The experience of prevention and control of new coronavirus infection in Hong Kong comes from the experience of prevention and control of SARS in 2003.

A spokesman for the Department of Health (DH) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said in response to an interview with Caijing on March 4 that the Centre for Health Protection has all along been providing routine disease surveillance systems, infection control and laboratory diagnosis services, epidemiological investigations of outbreaks will also be conducted. Based on risk communication and assessment, contingency plans will be drawn up and relevant public health measures will be implemented under the laws of Hong Kong to prevent infectious diseases.

On March 5, a paper from local hospitals and the Hong Kong Hospital Authority showed that in the six weeks leading up to the announcement of the outbreak in China on December 31,2019, no health care workers in Hong Kong had contracted new crown pneumonia. Among hospitalized patients, no new coronavirus was found to be circulating in the hospital.

How did Hong Kong do it?

● Zero infection among healthcare workers in Hong Kong

Early in the outbreak of new crown pneumonia, Hong Kong has been cautious in the prevention and control of nosocomial infection.

In the six weeks from December 31,2019, when the National Health and Human Services Commission announced the emergence of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, to February 10,42 cases of new coronavirus pneumonia were confirmed in Hong Kong.

As early as December 31,2019, the Food and Health Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region had already held an expert meeting, at which Yuen Kwok-yung, chair professor of the Department of Microbiology of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong, said the situation in Wuhan was "unusual. " "We must be vigilant. ".

Hong Kong, an international city of 1,104 square kilometers, is closely connected to the mainland and has a high risk of importing new pneumonia from the mainland. At a press conference after the experts' meeting, Hong Kong Secretary for Food and Health said all prevention and control measures should be strengthened, "health surveillance measures at entry and exit points should be strengthened, " and people should be reminded that respiratory symptoms, you should wear a mask and seek medical advice.

Professionals in Hong Kong also moved quickly to identify and isolate patients at an early stage by expanding clinical and epidemiological surveillance standards in response to the development of the epidemic.

Advance planning is a defining feature of Hong Kong's fight against the disease.

One example is "whether the patient has ever been to a hospital in mainland China" , which was adopted as one of the epidemiological criteria for surveillance in Hong Kong on January 16,2020.

The criterion of whether a patient had visited a hospital was included because it was a risk factor for viral infection during the SARS outbreak.

According to the experience during the SARS epidemic, nearly 60% of the people who had the misfortune of being infected with SARS virus in hospitals were medical and nursing staff. Therefore, active nosocomial infection control measures are essential and must be planned in advance.

Since 4 January, hospitals in Hong Kong have been providing Surgical mask to all medical staff, clinical patients and visitors.

Although there is no clear evidence that wearing Surgical mask alone protects people from the SARS virus, previous studies have shown that, at the very least, surgical masks worn by health care workers or patients can reduce the risk of an influenza pandemic in a hospital.

Good hand hygiene, wearing Surgical mask in hospitals and proper use of personal protective equipment in patient care, especially Aerosol Generation, are key infection control measures, can prevent the spread of the new coronavirus in hospital.

An experienced infection control nurse, while collecting samples of the new coronavirus in the air, wore a full N95 mask, face mask, hat, gloves and gown, said the personal protective equipment, and spent 63 minutes in close contact with a confirmed patient. After that, she completed 14 days of medical surveillance and developed no fever or respiratory symptoms.

Ten Authors, from the Queen Mary Hospital, the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine and the Hong Kong SAR Hospital Authority, looked at what hospitals in Hong Kong did during the first six weeks of the new crown pneumonia outbreak. The paper was published on March 5 in the Academic Journal Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology.

In the first six weeks before the new coronavirus was identified, Hong Kong had 413 health care workers caring for patients, 11 of whom had a history of close, unprotected contact and were therefore quarantined for 14 days. At the end of the isolation, none of the health care workers was found to be infected with the new coronavirus.

Of the 42 new coronary cases identified in Hong Kong in the first six weeks, 36 were immediately placed in isolation. As a result, no hospital-borne transmission of the new coronavirus was observed among hospitalized patients.

Even in general wards, where aerosol production is carried out in the face of ordinary patients, Hong Kong health care workers have stepped up the use of the full personal protective equipment. This is also a lesson from the SARS response. Procedures such as Endotracheal intubation, open aspiration, and the use of high-flow oxygen have been shown to be associated with risk factors for health care workers to contract the SARS virus.

By increasing surveillance during the evolution of the epidemic and gradually expanding screening criteria, Hong Kong was able to identify the majority of confirmed cases after hospitalization and within six weeks of the onset of the new crown disease, zero intra-hospital transmission has been achieved among medical staff and patients.

As of March 8, out of the 115 new cases reported by the Department of Health (DH) in the HKSAR, none of the healthcare workers had been infected.

. Vigilance of the HKSAR government

The Hong Kong SAR Government of China is keeping a close watch on NCP and is responding quickly.

On 31 December 2019, the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong initiated infection control measures. Based on Hong Kong's Preparedness Plan for infection control of infectious diseases. Measures include early identification, isolation, notification and molecular diagnosis of all suspected cases. The Hong Kong Hospital Authority is the governing body of all 43 public hospitals in Hong Kong and is responsible for 90 per cent of the in-patient services in Hong Kong.

The infection control team followed up immediately after laboratory confirmation of the patient's infection with the new coronavirus to identify healthcare workers and exposed patients, basically in accordance with the H7N9 avian influenza a contact tracing protocol in Hong Kong.

The Department of Health (DH) of the HKSAR is responsible for the implementation of the health care policies of the Hong Kong government. Its Centre for Health Protection has a constant disease surveillance system, infection control and laboratory diagnostic services. In the fight against infectious diseases, the objectives of the agency are real-time monitoring, rapid response and timely notification of risks.

Since the confirmation of cases of new crown pneumonia in mainland China, the DH of the Centre for Health Protection of the HKSAR has been closely monitoring the situation and maintaining close liaison with the NHCHC to follow up on the latest situation in real time. "starting from December 31,2006, the public, travellers and public and private healthcare institutions will be reminded of the situation through press releases, letters and dedicated websites, " a spokesman for the Department of Health in Hong Kong told CAIJING.

Since 31 December 2019, the Centre for Health Protection has been reminding residents to seek medical advice immediately if they have fever or other symptoms after returning from overseas. They should also inform their doctors of their recent travel history and wear surgical masks to prevent infection. At the same time, to remind local residents to wash their hands, cover their mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing, avoid going to crowded places, pay attention to symptoms, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

In early January 2020, although no cases of severe pneumonia associated with Wuhan were detected in Hong Kong at that time, on January 2, the Hong Kong government held an inter-departmental meeting on the cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan and stood ready to ensure prompt response if necessary, and to remind the relevant departments to be vigilant and well prepared.

Prevention and control measures mentioned on 2 January, including letters to schools, calls for enhanced personal and environmental hygiene measures, etc. . The Hong Kong Hospital Authority (Ha) has also reminded front-line healthcare professionals, including staff of the 18 regional Chinese Medicine Teaching and Research Centres, to pay more attention to the clinical conditions of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause, including fever and acute respiratory tract infection, or pneumonia symptoms, have you been to Wuhan market or Seafood Market 14 days before the onset of symptoms.

With effect from 3 January, additional thermography will be provided at the HKIA for body temperature monitoring of passengers arriving from Wuhan. Travellers with acute respiratory symptoms found at all immigration control points, including high-speed Rail Hong Kong West Guryong Station, who had visited Wuhan market or seafood market 14 days before onset of symptoms, will be immediately transferred to public hospitals for isolation and follow-up.

On February 7, Hong Kong Resident Li Fan entered Hong Kong, customs clearance has been restricted, "usually in Lo Wu port, was through the Shenzhen Bay Port. ". From 00:00 on February 4, the HKSAR government closed four control points, including Lo Wu, Fukuda, Huanggang Port Control Point and Hong kong-macau ferry terminals.

Li saw that passengers passing through the border wore face masks and underwent temperature checks and health card registration on both sides of the mainland and Hong Kong Customs. On the Hong Kong side, the health card was filled out with the Hong Kong residential address and personal contact information. Earlier, Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie Lam announced that from February 1, the Lo Wu port and Shenzhen Bay Port will take the lead in the implementation of health declaration system.

As early as January 4, Hong Kong announced the "preparedness and Response Plan for New Infectious Diseases of public health importance" (the plan) and activated the serious response level with immediate effect. In response to a reporter from Caijing, the Hong Kong Department of Health (DH) said that the contingency plan was launched at that time and was based on a number of factors.

Factors to be considered include the patient's condition, such as severe complications, hospitalisation and death; the trajectory of the outbreak; the ability of the disease to be transmitted from person to person and to cause a sustained community outbreak; and the Geographical Spread of the outbreak; The local survival of the vector; the vulnerability of the population to infection; the availability of any preventive measures such as vaccines and feasible treatments; and recommendations from international sources such as the World Health Organization.

The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China made "Severe Emerging Infectious Respiratory System" a statutory notifiable infectious disease on January 8. Doctors are required to report suspected cases to the Department of Health.

In response to the development of the outbreak, the Centre for Health Protection has been revising its surveillance criteria, expanding the scope of surveillance and enhancing port health measures as appropriate to better respond to possible risks based on risk assessment.

"The Centre for Health Protection will continue to closely monitor the local, mainland and overseas situation, continue to follow up on the epidemiological investigation of confirmed local cases and contact tracing, and carry out local quarantine work, " a spokesman for the DH said.

● apart from those in isolation, daily life remains normal

On February 3, the Hong Kong government announced that Hong Kong residents who had visited Hubei Province in the past 14 days would be required to undergo home quarantine and wear electronic bracelets upon returning to Hong Kong. This is to prevent the quarantined in the home during isolation, the bracelet can not be taken off, and connected to the relevant mobile devices. If the mobile phone or bracelet is damaged or the mobile phone is taken out, the relevant device will immediately inform the Hong Kong Department of Health and the police for follow-up action.

The principal medical officer of the Department of Health in Hong Kong, Lin Weici, said that under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance, people who undergo compulsory quarantine should stay in a designated place for a designated period of time. Those who fail to do so are liable to six months'imprisonment and a fine of HK $5,000. The government will take strict enforcement action.

In Hong Kong, close contacts of patients with NCP also need to be quarantined for 14 days. 14 days of medical surveillance after the 14-day quarantine period. During medical surveillance, they are advised to wear masks in hospitals and communities.

"people have become more aware of the dangers and should wear masks in any public place, " Zhang Ke, who is studying for a master's degree in Hong Kong, told Caijing. "please wear a mask when you enter the store, " he said. "today, while my friend was pulling his mask up to his neck for a while, a little girl pointed at him and asked, "why don't you wear a mask? ".

People in Hong Kong pay much attention to personal hygiene. Wearing a mask has always been a good habit of Hong Kong people, the common cold, individuals will consciously go out to meet people when wearing a mask.

The price of face masks is going up. Zhang Ke told the reporter of"finance and Economics", a few shops face mask quantity is sufficient, the price grows exponentially however. "The first box of 50 ordinary face masks I bought on January 21 cost only 55 Hong Kong dollars (about 49 yuan) . It started to rise to 100 Hong Kong dollars around January 23, rose to about 200 Hong Kong dollars after the Spring Festival. I went to the store two days ago and bought a box of ordinary face masks for 268 Hong Kong dollars (about 240 yuan) . " KF94 masks imported from South Korea cost as much as 1,800 Hong Kong dollars (about 1,605 yuan) .

In early February, a woman who had moved to Hong Kong from Zhuhai after years of seeing the Wuhan outbreak on her friends'network bought 200 protective clothing in Wuhan through an online payment service and asked her friends in Wuhan to help donate them to two hospitals and a nursing home in Wuhan.

At the height of the mainland epidemic, some of Hong Kong's supplies were also stretched. "As long as there are people waiting in line at the shops, most of them are buying masks, " Li said. "alcohol is also not easy to get and the price is higher. " Supermarkets have also seen a rush to buy, "toilet paper, rice and other daily necessities can be said to be snapped up. ".

In the more than two months since the outbreak of the new crown disease, Zhang Ke, a graduate student in Hong Kong, does not think that the lives of most Hong Kong people have been greatly affected by the outbreak.

In March, as the outbreak accelerated around the world, universities in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region tightened restrictions on people traveling to and from high-risk areas. On March 3, Zhang Ke's school sent out a notification email showing that, "To protect the health of the university community, students, staff and visitors who have travelled to mainland China, South Korea, Italy (Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy and Veneto) , Japan, Singapore and Iran have been banned from the campus since 5 am on March 4 until they have completed 14 days of home quarantine. "

The school also does not recommend that out-of-town students return. Inevitably, the resumption of classes was delayed, and on February 17th some Hong Kong universities began offering online courses. The recovery time for face-to-face classes has been pushed back, seemingly without end.

● Draw lessons from SARS epidemic prevention experience

According to the Hong Kong SAR Hospital Authority (Ha) on March 8,2008, a newly confirmed patient with pneumonia passed away that afternoon, bringing the cumulative number of deaths in Hong Kong to three.

At the time of the SARS epidemic in 2003, Hong Kong's population was about 6.8 million. The SARS outbreak lasted more than three months and infected 1,755 people in Hong Kong, 300 of whom died. From the early announcement of new Crown Disease, Hong Kong's health authorities and hospitals have repeatedly referred to the experience of SARS in various aspects.

On May 28,2003, Hong Kong announced the establishment of a committee of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome experts to review the effectiveness of the health care system. Less than five months later, a 253-page report entitled "Lessons Learned, Prevention in action" was published.

The report confesses that in the early days of the epidemic, when little was known about the disease and its causes in Hong Kong, there was no doubt that there were some obvious deficiencies in the system. As the epidemic spread, some people holding important positions also became infected with the SARS virus, to make the problem worse.

For example, on 24 February 2003, the Hong Kong Department of Health, in investigating the contact history of professors from Guangzhou who had been infected with SARS, traced only those who had had close contact with the patient, rather than where the patient had stayed, as a result, a number of people were infected. It was not until March 8 that the professor began to track down people who had come into contact with him in the hotel he had visited.

In Retrospect, the Prince of Wales Hospital's handling of the SARS outbreak has also come in for some criticism.

On March 10,2003, Prince of Wales Hospital Management received a report that 11 staff members working in ward 8A were on sick leave at the same time, and the outbreak in the hospital came to light. On the same day, Ward 8a of the hospital was closed and no more patients were admitted.

The SARS Expert Committee considered that the hospital did not have a pre-established epidemic prevention and control plan on the issue of the decision on hospital operation, this, coupled with the lack of involvement of the Prince of Wales Hospital in making important decisions on disease control measures, is not conducive to the management of the epidemic.

On 11 March 2003, the Hong Kong Department of Health (DH) learned of the outbreak of Prince of Wales Hospital from media reports, but was not involved in discussions on hospital operation and closure. There was a lack of population-based consensus between the Department of Health (DH) and the Hospital Authority (Ha) , and the impact of infectious diseases on the community was not fully understood in the early stages of the outbreak.

The reporting of case information at the working level by the Department of Health and the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, China, was initially rather confusing and the information management system adopted was not able to cope with the needs of a large-scale epidemic and was overwhelmed.

In conclusion, the report points out weaknesses in the hospital infection control framework, inadequate training of staff in sensory control, poor design, bed spacing and ventilation of hospital wards, and inadequate equipment, lack of an established infectious disease control plan or communication policy, and unclear definition of the respective roles and responsibilities of the Ha, DH and the university.

How the government provides accurate information to the public is also a reflection. The report argues that the government must strike a careful balance between trying to placate the public and allay its fears, while not allowing the public to be complacent.

This is because, according to the then Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food of Hong Kong, China, in response to media enquiries on 14 March 2003 as to whether there had been an outbreak of SARS in the community, it explained the number of cases and pointed out that according to observations, no unusual increase in the overall number of pneumonia cases was observed. The credibility of the news raised questions among the public.

In retrospect, the SARS Expert Committee felt that the wording of the Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food should have been more cautious and that such technical questions should be answered by the senior Public Health Officer of the Department of Health.

The inclusion of SARS in the list of notifiable diseases on 27 March 2003 may have helped to raise public awareness.

The reflection on SARS epidemic situation covers government, hospital, community and so on.

"Amoy Gardens" is a case that can not be bypassed in the fight against SARS in Hong Kong. The source patient from the Prince of Wales Hospital may have first infected a small number of residents of block e of Amoy Gardens, and then infected the other residents of block e through the sewage system, person-to-person contact and use of public facilities. These residents then transmitted SARS to others inside and outside seat e through person-to-person contact and environmental pollution.

There was a delay in the epidemiological investigation of the patient. Epidemiological investigations initially focused on individual SARS cases rather than on all Amoy Gardens residents. The government's lack of manpower and Knowledge of epidemiology in the field contributed to the slow progress of the initial epidemiological survey.

On 26 March 2003, the Princess Margaret Hospital was designated as the SARS hospital. In the first week, the Princess Margaret Hospital received an average of more than 70 new SARS patients a day, many of whom were seriously ill and required intensive treatment.

Princess Margaret Hospital's medical staff and expertise have been pushed to the limit by the failure to anticipate a sudden influx of patients, mainly from Amoy Gardens, which has increased the risk of infection among health care workers.

The SARS Expert Committee considered that the designation of Princess Margaret Hospital as a SARS hospital was reasonable at the time, but that this arrangement should be reviewed and reconsidered as the scale of the outbreak in Amoy Gardens became clear.

According to data provided by the World Health Organization on August 15,2003, the mortality rate of SARS cases in Hong Kong SAR of China was 17.1% , higher than that of mainland China's 6.6% and lower than that of Taiwan's 27.1% .

Even when age was factored out, the standardized death rate for SARS patients in Hong Kong was still much higher than in the mainland. The cause of the difference is unknown, but it is worth exploring whether the identification of the cases is complete, whether the diagnosis is correct, whether the treatment is effective, whether Chinese medicine is used, and how the elderly are cared for.

As a new disease emerging for the first time, it is only fair and reasonable that the decision-making process and decision-making should be carefully assessed on the basis of the knowledge and information available at the time. In the early period of SARS epidemic, the hospital system undoubtedly had some defects, from which we must draw lessons, strengthen the public health work, improve the coordination of all aspects of health care, clarify the responsibilities of various departments, and improve communication among them.

In recognition of the importance attached to the independence and transparency of the review, the "lessons learned, prevention in action" was published on 2 October 2003.

Although Hong Kong has not yet closed the community, a variety of crowded places are not closed for business. But when people are out and about, they are already very aware of the longer distances between them.

"We are very careful in our discussions about the dangers of second-guessing. Therefore, in studying every event, we try to put ourselves in the shoes of those who know what they can do at the time. It's easiest to get the information afterwards and then criticize it."

It began with a report by 11 experts, led by the Hong Kong SAR government. The report, called lessons learned, is a summary of the experience of fighting the SARS epidemic in 2003, when Zhong Nanshan, director of the Atypical pneumonia, was one of the experts.

17 years later, the streets of Hong Kong, the city is still lively, people flow shuttle, the city as usual. But with 7.45 million people in a compact, densely populated city, infectious disease control is a challenge.

As of 8:00 p.m. on 8 March 2020, a total of 115 cases of new coronavirus pneumonia had been reported in Hong Kong SAR of China. Among them, 114 cases were confirmed and 1 case was suspected. This is much better than during SARS. The experience of prevention and control of new coronavirus infection in Hong Kong comes from the experience of prevention and control of SARS in 2003.

A spokesman for the Department of Health (DH) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said in response to an interview with Caijing on March 4 that the Centre for Health Protection has all along been providing routine disease surveillance systems, infection control and laboratory diagnosis services, epidemiological investigations of outbreaks will also be conducted. Based on risk communication and assessment, contingency plans will be drawn up and relevant public health measures will be implemented under the laws of Hong Kong to prevent infectious diseases.

On March 5, a paper from local hospitals and the Hong Kong Hospital Authority showed that in the six weeks leading up to the announcement of the outbreak in China on December 31,2019, no health care workers in Hong Kong had contracted new crown pneumonia. Among hospitalized patients, no new coronavirus was found to be circulating in the hospital.

How did Hong Kong do it?

● Zero infection among healthcare workers in Hong Kong

Early in the outbreak of new crown pneumonia, Hong Kong has been cautious in the prevention and control of nosocomial infection.

In the six weeks from December 31,2019, when the National Health and Human Services Commission announced the emergence of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, to February 10,42 cases of new coronavirus pneumonia were confirmed in Hong Kong.

As early as December 31,2019, the Food and Health Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region had already held an expert meeting, at which Yuen Kwok-yung, chair professor of the Department of Microbiology of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong, said the situation in Wuhan was "unusual. " "We must be vigilant. ".

Hong Kong, an international city of 1,104 square kilometers, is closely connected to the mainland and has a high risk of importing new pneumonia from the mainland. At a press conference after the experts' meeting, Hong Kong Secretary for Food and Health said all prevention and control measures should be strengthened, "health surveillance measures at entry and exit points should be strengthened, " and people should be reminded that respiratory symptoms, you should wear a mask and seek medical advice.

Professionals in Hong Kong also moved quickly to identify and isolate patients at an early stage by expanding clinical and epidemiological surveillance standards in response to the development of the epidemic.

Advance planning is a defining feature of Hong Kong's fight against the disease.

One example is "whether the patient has ever been to a hospital in mainland China" , which was adopted as one of the epidemiological criteria for surveillance in Hong Kong on January 16,2020.

The criterion of whether a patient had visited a hospital was included because it was a risk factor for viral infection during the SARS outbreak.

According to the experience during the SARS epidemic, nearly 60% of the people who had the misfortune of being infected with SARS virus in hospitals were medical and nursing staff. Therefore, active nosocomial infection control measures are essential and must be planned in advance.

Since 4 January, hospitals in Hong Kong have been providing Surgical mask to all medical staff, clinical patients and visitors.

Although there is no clear evidence that wearing Surgical mask alone protects people from the SARS virus, previous studies have shown that, at the very least, surgical masks worn by health care workers or patients can reduce the risk of an influenza pandemic in a hospital.

Good hand hygiene, wearing Surgical mask in hospitals and proper use of personal protective equipment in patient care, especially Aerosol Generation, are key infection control measures, can prevent the spread of the new coronavirus in hospital.

An experienced infection control nurse, while collecting samples of the new coronavirus in the air, wore a full N95 mask, face mask, hat, gloves and gown, said the personal protective equipment, and spent 63 minutes in close contact with a confirmed patient. After that, she completed 14 days of medical surveillance and developed no fever or respiratory symptoms.

Ten Authors, from the Queen Mary Hospital, the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine and the Hong Kong SAR Hospital Authority, looked at what hospitals in Hong Kong did during the first six weeks of the new crown pneumonia outbreak. The paper was published on March 5 in the Academic Journal Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology.

In the first six weeks before the new coronavirus was identified, Hong Kong had 413 health care workers caring for patients, 11 of whom had a history of close, unprotected contact and were therefore quarantined for 14 days. At the end of the isolation, none of the health care workers was found to be infected with the new coronavirus.

Of the 42 new coronary cases identified in Hong Kong in the first six weeks, 36 were immediately placed in isolation. As a result, no hospital-borne transmission of the new coronavirus was observed among hospitalized patients.

Even in general wards, where aerosol production is carried out in the face of ordinary patients, Hong Kong health care workers have stepped up the use of the full personal protective equipment. This is also a lesson from the SARS response. Procedures such as Endotracheal intubation, open aspiration, and the use of high-flow oxygen have been shown to be associated with risk factors for health care workers to contract the SARS virus.

By increasing surveillance during the evolution of the epidemic and gradually expanding screening criteria, Hong Kong was able to identify the majority of confirmed cases after hospitalization and within six weeks of the onset of the new crown disease, zero intra-hospital transmission has been achieved among medical staff and patients.

As of March 8, out of the 115 new cases reported by the Department of Health (DH) in the HKSAR, none of the healthcare workers had been infected.

Early in the outbreak of new crown pneumonia, Hong Kong has been cautious in the prevention and control of nosocomial infection.

In the six weeks from December 31,2019, when the National Health and Human Services Commission announced the emergence of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, to February 10,42 cases of new coronavirus pneumonia were confirmed in Hong Kong.

As early as December 31,2019, the Food and Health Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region had already held an expert meeting, at which Yuen Kwok-yung, chair professor of the Department of Microbiology of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong, said the situation in Wuhan was "unusual. " "We must be vigilant. ".

Hong Kong, an international city of 1,104 square kilometers, is closely connected to the mainland and has a high risk of importing new pneumonia from the mainland. At a press conference after the experts' meeting, Hong Kong Secretary for Food and Health said all prevention and control measures should be strengthened, "health surveillance measures at entry and exit points should be strengthened, " and people should be reminded that respiratory symptoms, you should wear a mask and seek medical advice.

Professionals in Hong Kong also moved quickly to identify and isolate patients at an early stage by expanding clinical and epidemiological surveillance standards in response to the development of the epidemic.

Advance planning is a defining feature of Hong Kong's fight against the disease.

One example is "whether the patient has ever been to a hospital in mainland China" , which was adopted as one of the epidemiological criteria for surveillance in Hong Kong on January 16,2020.

The criterion of whether a patient had visited a hospital was included because it was a risk factor for viral infection during the SARS outbreak.

According to the experience during the SARS epidemic, nearly 60% of the people who had the misfortune of being infected with SARS virus in hospitals were medical and nursing staff. Therefore, active nosocomial infection control measures are essential and must be planned in advance.

. Vigilance of the HKSAR government

The Hong Kong SAR Government of China is keeping a close watch on NCP and is responding quickly.

On 31 December 2019, the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong initiated infection control measures. Based on Hong Kong's Preparedness Plan for infection control of infectious diseases. Measures include early identification, isolation, notification and molecular diagnosis of all suspected cases. The Hong Kong Hospital Authority is the governing body of all 43 public hospitals in Hong Kong and is responsible for 90 per cent of the in-patient services in Hong Kong.

The infection control team followed up immediately after laboratory confirmation of the patient's infection with the new coronavirus to identify healthcare workers and exposed patients, basically in accordance with the H7N9 avian influenza a contact tracing protocol in Hong Kong.

The Department of Health (DH) of the HKSAR is responsible for the implementation of the health care policies of the Hong Kong government. Its Centre for Health Protection has a constant disease surveillance system, infection control and laboratory diagnostic services. In the fight against infectious diseases, the objectives of the agency are real-time monitoring, rapid response and timely notification of risks.

Since the confirmation of cases of new crown pneumonia in mainland China, the DH of the Centre for Health Protection of the HKSAR has been closely monitoring the situation and maintaining close liaison with the NHCHC to follow up on the latest situation in real time. "starting from December 31,2006, the public, travellers and public and private healthcare institutions will be reminded of the situation through press releases, letters and dedicated websites, " a spokesman for the Department of Health in Hong Kong told CAIJING.

Since 31 December 2019, the Centre for Health Protection has been reminding residents to seek medical advice immediately if they have fever or other symptoms after returning from overseas. They should also inform their doctors of their recent travel history and wear surgical masks to prevent infection. At the same time, to remind local residents to wash their hands, cover their mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing, avoid going to crowded places, pay attention to symptoms, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

In early January 2020, although no cases of severe pneumonia associated with Wuhan were detected in Hong Kong at that time, on January 2, the Hong Kong government held an inter-departmental meeting on the cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan and stood ready to ensure prompt response if necessary, and to remind the relevant departments to be vigilant and well prepared.

Prevention and control measures mentioned on 2 January, including letters to schools, calls for enhanced personal and environmental hygiene measures, etc. . The Hong Kong Hospital Authority (Ha) has also reminded front-line healthcare professionals, including staff of the 18 regional Chinese Medicine Teaching and Research Centres, to pay more attention to the clinical conditions of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause, including fever and acute respiratory tract infection, or pneumonia symptoms, have you been to Wuhan market or Seafood Market 14 days before the onset of symptoms.

With effect from 3 January, additional thermography will be provided at the HKIA for body temperature monitoring of passengers arriving from Wuhan. Travellers with acute respiratory symptoms found at all immigration control points, including high-speed Rail Hong Kong West Guryong Station, who had visited Wuhan market or seafood market 14 days before onset of symptoms, will be immediately transferred to public hospitals for isolation and follow-up.

On February 7, Hong Kong Resident Li Fan entered Hong Kong, customs clearance has been restricted, "usually in Lo Wu port, was through the Shenzhen Bay Port. ". From 00:00 on February 4, the HKSAR government closed four control points, including Lo Wu, Fukuda, Huanggang Port Control Point and Hong kong-macau ferry terminals.

Li saw that passengers passing through the border wore face masks and underwent temperature checks and health card registration on both sides of the mainland and Hong Kong Customs. On the Hong Kong side, the health card was filled out with the Hong Kong residential address and personal contact information. Earlier, Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie Lam announced that from February 1, the Lo Wu port and Shenzhen Bay Port will take the lead in the implementation of health declaration system.

As early as January 4, Hong Kong announced the "preparedness and Response Plan for New Infectious Diseases of public health importance" (the plan) and activated the serious response level with immediate effect. In response to a reporter from Caijing, the Hong Kong Department of Health (DH) said that the contingency plan was launched at that time and was based on a number of factors.

Factors to be considered include the patient's condition, such as severe complications, hospitalisation and death; the trajectory of the outbreak; the ability of the disease to be transmitted from person to person and to cause a sustained community outbreak; and the Geographical Spread of the outbreak; The local survival of the vector; the vulnerability of the population to infection; the availability of any preventive measures such as vaccines and feasible treatments; and recommendations from international sources such as the World Health Organization.

The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China made "Severe Emerging Infectious Respiratory System" a statutory notifiable infectious disease on January 8. Doctors are required to report suspected cases to the Department of Health.

In response to the development of the outbreak, the Centre for Health Protection has been revising its surveillance criteria, expanding the scope of surveillance and enhancing port health measures as appropriate to better respond to possible risks based on risk assessment.

"The Centre for Health Protection will continue to closely monitor the local, mainland and overseas situation, continue to follow up on the epidemiological investigation of confirmed local cases and contact tracing, and carry out local quarantine work, " a spokesman for the DH said.

● apart from those in isolation, daily life remains normal

On February 3, the Hong Kong government announced that Hong Kong residents who had visited Hubei Province in the past 14 days would be required to undergo home quarantine and wear electronic bracelets upon returning to Hong Kong. This is to prevent the quarantined in the home during isolation, the bracelet can not be taken off, and connected to the relevant mobile devices. If the mobile phone or bracelet is damaged or the mobile phone is taken out, the relevant device will immediately inform the Hong Kong Department of Health and the police for follow-up action.

The principal medical officer of the Department of Health in Hong Kong, Lin Weici, said that under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance, people who undergo compulsory quarantine should stay in a designated place for a designated period of time. Those who fail to do so are liable to six months'imprisonment and a fine of HK $5,000. The government will take strict enforcement action.

In Hong Kong, close contacts of patients with NCP also need to be quarantined for 14 days. 14 days of medical surveillance after the 14-day quarantine period. During medical surveillance, they are advised to wear masks in hospitals and communities.

"people have become more aware of the dangers and should wear masks in any public place, " Zhang Ke, who is studying for a master's degree in Hong Kong, told Caijing. "please wear a mask when you enter the store, " he said. "today, while my friend was pulling his mask up to his neck for a while, a little girl pointed at him and asked, "why don't you wear a mask? ".

People in Hong Kong pay much attention to personal hygiene. Wearing a mask has always been a good habit of Hong Kong people, the common cold, individuals will consciously go out to meet people when wearing a mask.

The price of face masks is going up. Zhang Ke told the reporter of"finance and Economics", a few shops face mask quantity is sufficient, the price grows exponentially however. "The first box of 50 ordinary face masks I bought on January 21 cost only 55 Hong Kong dollars (about 49 yuan) . It started to rise to 100 Hong Kong dollars around January 23, rose to about 200 Hong Kong dollars after the Spring Festival. I went to the store two days ago and bought a box of ordinary face masks for 268 Hong Kong dollars (about 240 yuan) . " KF94 masks imported from South Korea cost as much as 1,800 Hong Kong dollars (about 1,605 yuan) .

In early February, a woman who had moved to Hong Kong from Zhuhai after years of seeing the Wuhan outbreak on her friends'network bought 200 protective clothing in Wuhan through an online payment service and asked her friends in Wuhan to help donate them to two hospitals and a nursing home in Wuhan.

At the height of the mainland epidemic, some of Hong Kong's supplies were also stretched. "As long as there are people waiting in line at the shops, most of them are buying masks, " Li said. "alcohol is also not easy to get and the price is higher. " Supermarkets have also seen a rush to buy, "toilet paper, rice and other daily necessities can be said to be snapped up. ".

In the more than two months since the outbreak of the new crown disease, Zhang Ke, a graduate student in Hong Kong, does not think that the lives of most Hong Kong people have been greatly affected by the outbreak.

In March, as the outbreak accelerated around the world, universities in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region tightened restrictions on people traveling to and from high-risk areas. On March 3, Zhang Ke's school sent out a notification email showing that, "To protect the health of the university community, students, staff and visitors who have travelled to mainland China, South Korea, Italy (Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy and Veneto) , Japan, Singapore and Iran have been banned from the campus since 5 am on March 4 until they have completed 14 days of home quarantine. "

The school also does not recommend that out-of-town students return. Inevitably, the resumption of classes was delayed, and on February 17th some Hong Kong universities began offering online courses. The recovery time for face-to-face classes has been pushed back, seemingly without end.

● Draw lessons from SARS epidemic prevention experience

According to the Hong Kong SAR Hospital Authority (Ha) on March 8,2008, a newly confirmed patient with pneumonia passed away that afternoon, bringing the cumulative number of deaths in Hong Kong to three.

At the time of the SARS epidemic in 2003, Hong Kong's population was about 6.8 million. The SARS outbreak lasted more than three months and infected 1,755 people in Hong Kong, 300 of whom died. From the early announcement of new Crown Disease, Hong Kong's health authorities and hospitals have repeatedly referred to the experience of SARS in various aspects.

On May 28,2003, Hong Kong announced the establishment of a committee of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome experts to review the effectiveness of the health care system. Less than five months later, a 253-page report entitled "Lessons Learned, Prevention in action" was published.

The report confesses that in the early days of the epidemic, when little was known about the disease and its causes in Hong Kong, there was no doubt that there were some obvious deficiencies in the system. As the epidemic spread, some people holding important positions also became infected with the SARS virus, to make the problem worse.

For example, on 24 February 2003, the Hong Kong Department of Health, in investigating the contact history of professors from Guangzhou who had been infected with SARS, traced only those who had had close contact with the patient, rather than where the patient had stayed, as a result, a number of people were infected. It was not until March 8 that the professor began to track down people who had come into contact with him in the hotel he had visited.

In Retrospect, the Prince of Wales Hospital's handling of the SARS outbreak has also come in for some criticism.

On March 10,2003, Prince of Wales Hospital Management received a report that 11 staff members working in ward 8A were on sick leave at the same time, and the outbreak in the hospital came to light. On the same day, Ward 8a of the hospital was closed and no more patients were admitted.

The SARS Expert Committee considered that the hospital did not have a pre-established epidemic prevention and control plan on the issue of the decision on hospital operation, this, coupled with the lack of involvement of the Prince of Wales Hospital in making important decisions on disease control measures, is not conducive to the management of the epidemic.

On 11 March 2003, the Hong Kong Department of Health (DH) learned of the outbreak of Prince of Wales Hospital from media reports, but was not involved in discussions on hospital operation and closure. There was a lack of population-based consensus between the Department of Health (DH) and the Hospital Authority (Ha) , and the impact of infectious diseases on the community was not fully understood in the early stages of the outbreak.

The reporting of case information at the working level by the Department of Health and the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, China, was initially rather confusing and the information management system adopted was not able to cope with the needs of a large-scale epidemic and was overwhelmed.

In conclusion, the report points out weaknesses in the hospital infection control framework, inadequate training of staff in sensory control, poor design, bed spacing and ventilation of hospital wards, and inadequate equipment, lack of an established infectious disease control plan or communication policy, and unclear definition of the respective roles and responsibilities of the Ha, DH and the university.

How the government provides accurate information to the public is also a reflection. The report argues that the government must strike a careful balance between trying to placate the public and allay its fears, while not allowing the public to be complacent.

This is because, according to the then Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food of Hong Kong, China, in response to media enquiries on 14 March 2003 as to whether there had been an outbreak of SARS in the community, it explained the number of cases and pointed out that according to observations, no unusual increase in the overall number of pneumonia cases was observed. The credibility of the news raised questions among the public.

In retrospect, the SARS Expert Committee felt that the wording of the Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food should have been more cautious and that such technical questions should be answered by the senior Public Health Officer of the Department of Health.

The inclusion of SARS in the list of notifiable diseases on 27 March 2003 may have helped to raise public awareness.

The reflection on SARS epidemic situation covers government, hospital, community and so on.

"Amoy Gardens" is a case that can not be bypassed in the fight against SARS in Hong Kong. The source patient from the Prince of Wales Hospital may have first infected a small number of residents of block e of Amoy Gardens, and then infected the other residents of block e through the sewage system, person-to-person contact and use of public facilities. These residents then transmitted SARS to others inside and outside seat e through person-to-person contact and environmental pollution.

There was a delay in the epidemiological investigation of the patient. Epidemiological investigations initially focused on individual SARS cases rather than on all Amoy Gardens residents. The government's lack of manpower and Knowledge of epidemiology in the field contributed to the slow progress of the initial epidemiological survey.

On 26 March 2003, the Princess Margaret Hospital was designated as the SARS hospital. In the first week, the Princess Margaret Hospital received an average of more than 70 new SARS patients a day, many of whom were seriously ill and required intensive treatment.

Princess Margaret Hospital's medical staff and expertise have been pushed to the limit by the failure to anticipate a sudden influx of patients, mainly from Amoy Gardens, which has increased the risk of infection among health care workers.

The SARS Expert Committee considered that the designation of Princess Margaret Hospital as a SARS hospital was reasonable at the time, but that this arrangement should be reviewed and reconsidered as the scale of the outbreak in Amoy Gardens became clear.

According to data provided by the World Health Organization on August 15,2003, the mortality rate of SARS cases in Hong Kong SAR of China was 17.1% , higher than that of mainland China's 6.6% and lower than that of Taiwan's 27.1% .

Even when age was factored out, the standardized death rate for SARS patients in Hong Kong was still much higher than in the mainland. The cause of the difference is unknown, but it is worth exploring whether the identification of the cases is complete, whether the diagnosis is correct, whether the treatment is effective, whether Chinese medicine is used, and how the elderly are cared for.

As a new disease emerging for the first time, it is only fair and reasonable that the decision-making process and decision-making should be carefully assessed on the basis of the knowledge and information available at the time. In the early period of SARS epidemic, the hospital system undoubtedly had some defects, from which we must draw lessons, strengthen the public health work, improve the coordination of all aspects of health care, clarify the responsibilities of various departments, and improve communication among them.

In recognition of the importance attached to the independence and transparency of the review, the "lessons learned, prevention in action" was published on 2 October 2003.

(Zhang Ke and Li fan are pseudonyms)

According to the Hong Kong SAR Hospital Authority (Ha) on March 8,2008, a newly confirmed patient with pneumonia passed away that afternoon, bringing the cumulative number of deaths in Hong Kong to three.

At the time of the SARS epidemic in 2003, Hong Kong's population was about 6.8 million. The SARS outbreak lasted more than three months and infected 1,755 people in Hong Kong, 300 of whom died. From the early announcement of new Crown Disease, Hong Kong's health authorities and hospitals have repeatedly referred to the experience of SARS in various aspects.

It was not until March 8 that the professor began to track down people who had come into contact with him in the hotel he had visited.

In Retrospect, the Prince of Wales Hospital's handling of the SARS outbreak has also come in for some criticism.

On March 10,2003, Prince of Wales Hospital Management received a report that 11 staff members working in ward 8A were on sick leave at the same time, and the outbreak in the hospital came to light. On the same day, Ward 8a of the hospital was closed and no more patients were admitted.

The SARS Expert Committee considered that the hospital did not have a pre-established epidemic prevention and control plan on the issue of the decision on hospital operation, this, coupled with the lack of involvement of the Prince of Wales Hospital in making important decisions on disease control measures, is not conducive to the management of the epidemic.

On 11 March 2003, the Hong Kong Department of Health (DH) learned of the outbreak of Prince of Wales Hospital from media reports, but was not involved in discussions on hospital operation and closure. There was a lack of population-based consensus between the Department of Health (DH) and the Hospital Authority (Ha) , and the impact of infectious diseases on the community was not fully understood in the early stages of the outbreak.

The reporting of case information at the working level by the Department of Health and the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, China, was initially rather confusing and the information management system adopted was not able to cope with the needs of a large-scale epidemic and was overwhelmed.

In conclusion, the report points out weaknesses in the hospital infection control framework, inadequate training of staff in sensory control, poor design, bed spacing and ventilation of hospital wards, and inadequate equipment, lack of an established infectious disease control plan or communication policy, and unclear definition of the respective roles and responsibilities of the Ha, DH and the university.

How the government provides accurate information to the public is also a reflection. The report argues that the government must strike a careful balance between trying to placate the public and allay its fears, while not allowing the public to be complacent.

This is because, according to the then Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food of Hong Kong, China, in response to media enquiries on 14 March 2003 as to whether there had been an outbreak of SARS in the community, it explained the number of cases and pointed out that according to observations, no unusual increase in the overall number of pneumonia cases was observed. The credibility of the news raised questions among the public.

In retrospect, the SARS Expert Committee felt that the wording of the Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food should have been more cautious and that such technical questions should be answered by the senior Public Health Officer of the Department of Health.

The inclusion of SARS in the list of notifiable diseases on 27 March 2003 may have helped to raise public awareness.

The reflection on SARS epidemic situation covers government, hospital, community and so on.

"Amoy Gardens" is a case that can not be bypassed in the fight against SARS in Hong Kong. The source patient from the Prince of Wales Hospital may have first infected a small number of residents of block e of Amoy Gardens, and then infected the other residents of block e through the sewage system, person-to-person contact and use of public facilities. These residents then transmitted SARS to others inside and outside seat e through person-to-person contact and environmental pollution.

There was a delay in the epidemiological investigation of the patient. Epidemiological investigations initially focused on individual SARS cases rather than on all Amoy Gardens residents. The government's lack of manpower and Knowledge of epidemiology in the field contributed to the slow progress of the initial epidemiological survey.

On 26 March 2003, the Princess Margaret Hospital was designated as the SARS hospital. In the first week, the Princess Margaret Hospital received an average of more than 70 new SARS patients a day, many of whom were seriously ill and required intensive treatment.

Princess Margaret Hospital's medical staff and expertise have been pushed to the limit by the failure to anticipate a sudden influx of patients, mainly from Amoy Gardens, which has increased the risk of infection among health care workers.

The SARS Expert Committee considered that the designation of Princess Margaret Hospital as a SARS hospital was reasonable at the time, but that this arrangement should be reviewed and reconsidered as the scale of the outbreak in Amoy Gardens became clear.

According to data provided by the World Health Organization on August 15,2003, the mortality rate of SARS cases in Hong Kong SAR of China was 17.1% , higher than that of mainland China's 6.6% and lower than that of Taiwan's 27.1% .

Even when age was factored out, the standardized death rate for SARS patients in Hong Kong was still much higher than in the mainland. The cause of the difference is unknown, but it is worth exploring whether the identification of the cases is complete, whether the diagnosis is correct, whether the treatment is effective, whether Chinese medicine is used, and how the elderly are cared for.

As a new disease emerging for the first time, it is only fair and reasonable that the decision-making process and decision-making should be carefully assessed on the basis of the knowledge and information available at the time. In the early period of SARS epidemic, the hospital system undoubtedly had some defects, from which we must draw lessons, strengthen the public health work, improve the coordination of all aspects of health care, clarify the responsibilities of various departments, and improve communication among them.

In recognition of the importance attached to the independence and transparency of the review, the "lessons learned, prevention in action" was published on 2 October 2003.

Internet "WAR EPIDEMIC" : The most tense week in Wuhan, a sudden increase in health care payment through the last link
Affected by the epidemic, many medical insurance rapid opening of Internet medical payment business, but this may be far from the spring of the industry, the long-term "share of health insurance" is still a bottleneck, to find other buyers are also exploring the period.

The number of mutations in the new coronavirus has increased to 149, and experts say it has not changed much recently
The director-general of WHO said that the transmission of NCP was less efficient than influenza and did not appear to be driven by people who did not have the disease. This means that the outbreak it causes can be contained. But the recent global spread of the epidemic, people from all walks of life remain deeply concerned.

Head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention: It is very difficult to avoid a global pandemic, and the response is imminent

In terms of trends, a new global pandemic of pneumonia may be inevitable, and China will need to do its part to deal with the new risks posed by the global epidemic while fighting its own internal interdiction.
The first autopsy report of a deceased patient with NCP was published to improve the clinical diagnosis and treatment of the patient
The autopsy of 11 patients with NCP has been completed. According to the first report, the presence of mucilage in the deep part of the lung is helpful for the decision-making of sputum-resolving and sputum-expelling schemes in clinical treatment.
After the "effective medicine" came the "new Crown Vaccine" , word play or Rub hot?
The screening of drugs and vaccines, a much-anticipated event, also requires accurate information to reduce public misunderstanding.

28 days after the 730 million-dollar direct online reporting system for infectious diseases failed
After January 24,2020, the Infectious Disease Network direct report system is very important to report and summarize the information of epidemic situation in different places, and to prevent and control the epidemic situation as a whole, but still needs to further improve the reporting mechanism, the monitoring system is too complicated and so on.
From the cold bench to the spotlight, chloroquine and other "chicken ribs" medicine into the new scheme of diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia
ABIDOL and chloroquine phosphate are still needed to be tested in clinical trials for the treatment of new coronary pneumonia. Clinical trials of the drugs should continue even after the outbreak is over, to prevent a relapse.
Who was the first person to be genetically tested for new coronavirus pneumonia?
After the first "unclassified coronavirus" was detected by a third-party testing agency, the hospital was informed only by telephone. Three days later, the second case report read "SARS coronavirus. ". No one thought at the time that it was a COVID-19 attack.
Two new cases of coronary pneumonia with pathology results are available, and the autopsy is still under way
Researchers are trying to reveal the pathogenicity and lethality of the new coronavirus and provide new evidence for clinical treatment. The phase result is that the pathogenicity of the new coronavirus is similar to SARS, and the further result may be revealed by dissection.

Analysis of 70,000 new coronary disease cases: crude case-fatality rate 2.3% 
So far, there is no evidence of a superspreader event like the SARS outbreak, but the exact cause of the infection and the failure to prevent remains to be investigated.
From the lab to the ward, stop the new coronavirus
The tracing of the virus, the route of transmission from animal to human, and the mode of transmission from human to human are still in progress, and the development and validation of anti-viral vaccines and specific drugs are just beginning.
Doctors and nurses in Hubei face the toughest month as infections mount
Unknown to the virus, lack of medical supplies, but also because of high-intensity work pressure to affect immunity, leading to the peak of medical infection.

Internet "WAR EPIDEMIC" : The most tense week in Wuhan, a sudden increase in health care payment through the last link

Affected by the epidemic, many medical insurance rapid opening of Internet medical payment business, but this may be far from the spring of the industry, the long-term "share of health insurance" is still a bottleneck, to find other buyers are also exploring the period.

The number of mutations in the new coronavirus has increased to 149, and experts say it has not changed much recently

The director-general of WHO said that the transmission of NCP was less efficient than influenza and did not appear to be driven by people who did not have the disease. This means that the outbreak it causes can be contained. But the recent global spread of the epidemic, people from all walks of life remain deeply concerned.

Head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention: It is very difficult to avoid a global pandemic, and the response is imminent

In terms of trends, a new global pandemic of pneumonia may be inevitable, and China will need to do its part to deal with the new risks posed by the global epidemic while fighting its own internal interdiction.

The first autopsy report of a deceased patient with NCP was published to improve the clinical diagnosis and treatment of the patient

The autopsy of 11 patients with NCP has been completed. According to the first report, the presence of mucilage in the deep part of the lung is helpful for the decision-making of sputum-resolving and sputum-expelling schemes in clinical treatment.

After the "effective medicine" came the "new Crown Vaccine" , word play or Rub hot?

The screening of drugs and vaccines, a much-anticipated event, also requires accurate information to reduce public misunderstanding.

28 days after the 730 million-dollar direct online reporting system for infectious diseases failed

After January 24,2020, the Infectious Disease Network direct report system is very important to report and summarize the information of epidemic situation in different places, and to prevent and control the epidemic situation as a whole, but still needs to further improve the reporting mechanism, the monitoring system is too complicated and so on.

From the cold bench to the spotlight, chloroquine and other "chicken ribs" medicine into the new scheme of diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia

ABIDOL and chloroquine phosphate are still needed to be tested in clinical trials for the treatment of new coronary pneumonia. Clinical trials of the drugs should continue even after the outbreak is over, to prevent a relapse.

Who was the first person to be genetically tested for new coronavirus pneumonia?

After the first "unclassified coronavirus" was detected by a third-party testing agency, the hospital was informed only by telephone. Three days later, the second case report read "SARS coronavirus. ". No one thought at the time that it was a COVID-19 attack.

Two new cases of coronary pneumonia with pathology results are available, and the autopsy is still under way

Researchers are trying to reveal the pathogenicity and lethality of the new coronavirus and provide new evidence for clinical treatment. The phase result is that the pathogenicity of the new coronavirus is similar to SARS, and the further result may be revealed by dissection.

Analysis of 70,000 new coronary disease cases: crude case-fatality rate 2.3% 

So far, there is no evidence of a superspreader event like the SARS outbreak, but the exact cause of the infection and the failure to prevent remains to be investigated.

From the lab to the ward, stop the new coronavirus

The tracing of the virus, the route of transmission from animal to human, and the mode of transmission from human to human are still in progress, and the development and validation of anti-viral vaccines and specific drugs are just beginning.

Doctors and nurses in Hubei face the toughest month as infections mount

Unknown to the virus, lack of medical supplies, but also because of high-intensity work pressure to affect immunity, leading to the peak of medical infection. With the enhancement of the awareness and knowledge of virus, the relative protective measures are put in place, fewer and fewer medical staff should be infected in the later period.
