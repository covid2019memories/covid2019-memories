On January 24,2020, the 30th day of the Lunar New Year, my typical father, a big man from Shandong Province, got angry.

That night, his own sister, that is, my aunt, with my cousin to my home New Year's. The face-saving father hurriedly pulled out an old tea cake from the depths of the drawer. The tea cake was said to have been bought from a vendor in Yunnan a few years ago. A couple of hundred yuan was needed. If it was not for important festivals and important personnel, the father would not easily use it.

To my father's embarrassment, the water boiled and the tea was ready. My aunt first complained that her stomach was not good, and then said she would not sleep after drinking tea.

I rolled my eyes and peeked into the "deep meaning" of the tea set. I lifted the yellow cloth over the remaining tea set and told my aunt, "this set of tea cups was bought from the supermarket in 29. No one has used it. ". Aunt this just put down the heart of a stone, a long relief breath, a sip.

But this one, also seems to be in order to family heroic death. "Don't drink, you're still young, " she said, holding the Cup in her hand as she stopped her cousin, who was reading a doctorate

At the moment, new coronary pneumonia is spreading across the country. As of 2400 hours on January 24, the Health Commission had received a cumulative total of 1,287 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection from 29 provinces, regions and municipalities. Cases have been reported in all provinces except Tibet.

Shandong was not the most severe, but there were six cases. But I am in the rural areas of central Shandong, because the city has not yet confirmed staff, and has not yet specific to the large-scale publicity of the villages and towns, the sense of prevention is more lax.

There are many people like me who have returned from Beijing, Shanghai, Jinan, Qingdao, Xiangfan, Hubei and Huanggang. These personnel not only have not been reported statistics, but also as usual years ago to visit relatives and friends activities. It is rare for a rural woman like my aunt to have some education, know how to use social software, and have already purchased medical masks and disinfectants from county pharmacies.

In My village, the urgency of the epidemic on social media, and the fact that the data is refreshed every hour or two, has little to do with it. Here, over the age of 50 or 60, most of the elderly, only to watch local television stations, believe that the county, township government notice.

Young People's things, for them, is "Yangbao" (meaning to drink foreign ink for a few days, fried buns) .

Two

Burning the bread, also known as expansion. A fatal attack on a man from rural Shandong. It contains behind the forgotten, light, not in the local society and so on.

In Our village, from grandparents to parents, there is a joke: a young man who went to a big city to join the army and came back, and learned Mandarin, and the villagers asked him, when did you get home and he said, last night. Villagers mouth a Pie, rob white him, "still sit boat back, still sit bowl (last night) " .

For hundreds of years, no matter what earth-shaking changes have taken place in the outside world, no matter how much noise you make out in the outside world, when you return to the village for the New Year, you have to return to the village east of the "two eggs" , the village west of the "Komidori. You have to speak the local dialect, wear cotton-padded jacket, call clear all relatives, the first day of the New Year to five clothing (refers to the next five generations, a total of nine generations) in front of the Hall God Kowtow, the second day of the New Year to visit his father-in-law, the third day of the New Year to see grandma and uncle.

A scene of ancestor worship in rural Shandong Province during the Spring Festival in past years

Dad was a stickler for protocol. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, the younger sister's children were sick in hospital, the parents were urgent call to the hospital to help, can not sacrifice the ancestor of the same clan. On the third day of the New Year, my father came back from the county, went door-to-door to explain again, only to be afraid of "my family has a problem" misunderstanding.

Even though they had been aware of the danger and had contracted their social life to the smallest rural family, they could not resist these "rites" -- The visits of their parents and relatives -- and could not be omitted.

Mask, alcohol and other supplies, I was in the county on January 21 to prepare. At that time, the major pharmacies are still sufficient, I bought dozens of full. Give it away to your parents, and you can imagine how perfunctory they are and how much they think you're making a fuss.

As for wearing a mask strictly, it is no less than Scheherazade.

In 2018, on a business trip to Inner Mongolia, I saw a fashionable wool cloak and bought it for my mother. For two years, my mother didn't wear it once. She asked her why. She said, "if I go to Beijing to see you wear it again, I'll laugh at you if I wear it again in the village! " It is conceivable that in the early days of the epidemic, if a rural woman or an old man who has been a farmer all her life, suddenly in the village wearing a mask and people playing cards, chatting, wearing a mask to worship on the ancestral temple, that is "make mischief" AH!

My parents, who are afraid of others'pointing, love to make mischief in the city and shake my hair at the music festival, dare not stand out too much in the countryside.

On January 23rd and 24th, I went through the village lane to see my grandmother. I was wearing a mask. But when I saw grandma, I had to take it off. In order not to let grandma angry, behind my "burn bag. ". Because of the village elders, two days before the festival, Grandma family to and fro, I still can only take off the mask, one by one shouting "uncle, uncle" , close chat, tea.

The toughest test came on the evening of January 23, when my grandmother left me to have dinner with my cousin, who had returned from a business trip to Xiangfan. A thousand thoughts turn in my stomach. Eat or don't eat? You want to get to the point? Finally, I did not say anything, helped grandma to cook a dinner, as usual swallowed.

On the way home, I asked myself, am I not alert enough? Don't you realize how serious this is? Aren't you afraid of dying? Of course they are. But before the death, fluke and the face, occupied the upper hand.

Shandong people attach importance to face, also attach importance to giving face, etiquette will often become virtual ceremony. To ensure their own safety, or to offend grandma and cousin's choice, I chose: Life, to be a "good man" , relatives in the eyes of not so inhuman people.

Three

Of course, for Shandong people, more important than face is authority.

Shangdong people attach importance to the "top" , care about public office. For example, on holidays, if the male younger generation is not happy to drink push and shove, often will cause the elder unhappy. Poor health and poor drinking are not the best excuses. But if you say, "If you get caught drunk driving during the holidays, you will be immediately fired from your job, " and all of a sudden you are forgiven. Even, will remind you, "must obey the unit discipline" .

It's the same with COVID-19. On the night of January 25th, my sister called to ask if it would be possible to go home the next day without my two children. Dad suddenly became angry, out of a pile of strange argument, saying that "the countryside is the safest, how can the virus find us this corner? Others are running to the countryside to hide, you are good, hide in the city. "

This irritation, or from the "face. ". On the second day of the Lunar New Year, the uncle and the girl of the neighbor family come to the door one after another?

I had the brainwave, from the Internet search for the State Council General Office, "for the community to solicit relevant local and departmental responsibility in the prevention and control of the epidemic in place, prevention and control of inadequate clues, " the red-headed document. "Now the state attaches great importance to it, " he said. "Once a public official fails to observe discipline and makes random visits, he will be seriously investigated and punished after being reported. The consequences will be very serious. "

Dad's fire broke in half, and the fight died down.

Until January 26, my county's epidemic prevention and control work, began to formally implement each village. This is clearly a bit of a drag.

On January 22, the Party secretary of our county conducted a survey on the prevention and control of new types of pneumonia in county hospitals and long-distance bus stations. On January 24, our County held a New Year Symposium for Outstanding Young Talents and a tea party to welcome the New Year in 2020, on January 27, the third day of the Lunar New Year, the website of the county's Government of the People's Republic of China published policy interpretations on Emergency Response To Public Health Emergencies and the popular knowledge of pneumonia in COVID-19, a meeting was held on the prevention and control of the COVID-19 infection in the whole county, and issued the "Shandong COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic management leading group (headquarters) on the strict prohibition of the market live poultry trade and slaughter behavior of the emergency notice. ".

At this time, as of 12:00 on January 27, Shandong Province had reported a cumulative total of 75 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, with a cumulative total of 1,544 close contacts traced.

As such, the government's actions are more efficient and effective.

On January 26, my township held a meeting on the prevention and control of COVID-19 pneumonia. The whole town printed and distributed more than 10,000 copies of the prevention and control of COVID-19 infection, all 44 villages began to trumpet their knowledge of Science.

This Day, did not go home to see their parents sister not only did not become the "joke" around, but by luck "dodged a bullet. This Day, my relatives and friends in the group began to spread all the village entrance ban, set up a special post to prevent villagers visit new year's photos and video.

The villages began to spread knowledge of epidemic prevention and control

In the video, villagers in charge of prevention and control work, some with wooden sticks, some with Brooms, saw people carrying gift boxes to visit relatives and friends and pushed and stopped them. They even threatened in dialect to "beat you" if they took another step.

The videos made the elders laugh, and soon they saw looking for acquaintances in the videos and photos as more fun than watching the gala sketch. Who who who who, braved the limelight to go out, was scolded a no face, become the village of the Spring Festival anecdotes.

What the government calls for and promotes is most likely to become fashionable in the countryside. On the third day of the New Year, my conservative father suddenly became fashionable. Early in the morning, he took the initiative to pick up the phone and call his cousins, tell them "do not have to come over to see the Nanko (your aunt, that is my grandma) , very period, all understand. "

"Don't get me wrong, we don't have to be polite, " my dad said.

The videos made the elders laugh, and soon they saw looking for acquaintances in the videos and photos as more fun than watching the gala sketch. Who who who who, braved the limelight to go out, was scolded a no face, become the village of the Spring Festival anecdotes.

What the government calls for and promotes is most likely to become fashionable in the countryside. On the third day of the New Year, my conservative father suddenly became fashionable. Early in the morning, he took the initiative to pick up the phone and call his cousins, tell them "do not have to come over to see the Nanko (your aunt, that is my grandma) , very period, all understand. "

"Don't get me wrong, we don't have to be polite, " my dad said.

One

On January 24,2020, the 30th day of the Lunar New Year, my typical father, a big man from Shandong Province, got angry.

That night, his own sister, that is, my aunt, with my cousin to my home New Year's. The face-saving father hurriedly pulled out an old tea cake from the depths of the drawer. The tea cake was said to have been bought from a vendor in Yunnan a few years ago. A couple of hundred yuan was needed. If it was not for important festivals and important personnel, the father would not easily use it.

To my father's embarrassment, the water boiled and the tea was ready. My aunt first complained that her stomach was not good, and then said she would not sleep after drinking tea.

I rolled my eyes and peeked into the "deep meaning" of the tea set. I lifted the yellow cloth over the remaining tea set and told my aunt, "this set of tea cups was bought from the supermarket in 29. No one has used it. ". Aunt this just put down the heart of a stone, a long relief breath, a sip.

But this one, also seems to be in order to family heroic death. "Don't drink, you're still young, " she said, holding the Cup in her hand as she stopped her cousin, who was reading a doctorate

At the moment, new coronary pneumonia is spreading across the country. As of 2400 hours on January 24, the Health Commission had received a cumulative total of 1,287 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection from 29 provinces, regions and municipalities. Cases have been reported in all provinces except Tibet.

Shandong was not the most severe, but there were six cases. But I am in the rural areas of central Shandong, because the city has not yet confirmed staff, and has not yet specific to the large-scale publicity of the villages and towns, the sense of prevention is more lax.

There are many people like me who have returned from Beijing, Shanghai, Jinan, Qingdao, Xiangfan, Hubei and Huanggang. These personnel not only have not been reported statistics, but also as usual years ago to visit relatives and friends activities. It is rare for a rural woman like my aunt to have some education, know how to use social software, and have already purchased medical masks and disinfectants from county pharmacies.

In My village, the urgency of the epidemic on social media, and the fact that the data is refreshed every hour or two, has little to do with it. Here, over the age of 50 or 60, most of the elderly, only to watch local television stations, believe that the county, township government notice.

Young People's things, for them, is "Yangbao" (meaning to drink foreign ink for a few days, fried buns) .

Two

Burning the bread, also known as expansion. A fatal attack on a man from rural Shandong. It contains behind the forgotten, light, not in the local society and so on.

In Our village, from grandparents to parents, there is a joke: a young man who went to a big city to join the army and came back, and learned Mandarin, and the villagers asked him, when did you get home and he said, last night. Villagers mouth a Pie, rob white him, "still sit boat back, still sit bowl (last night) " .

For hundreds of years, no matter what earth-shaking changes have taken place in the outside world, no matter how much noise you make out in the outside world, when you return to the village for the New Year, you have to return to the village east of the "two eggs" , the village west of the "Komidori. You have to speak the local dialect, wear cotton-padded jacket, call clear all relatives, the first day of the New Year to five clothing (refers to the next five generations, a total of nine generations) in front of the Hall God Kowtow, the second day of the New Year to visit his father-in-law, the third day of the New Year to see grandma and uncle.

A scene of ancestor worship in rural Shandong Province during the Spring Festival in past years

Dad was a stickler for protocol. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, the younger sister's children were sick in hospital, the parents were urgent call to the hospital to help, can not sacrifice the ancestor of the same clan. On the third day of the New Year, my father came back from the county, went door-to-door to explain again, only to be afraid of "my family has a problem" misunderstanding.

Even though they had been aware of the danger and had contracted their social life to the smallest rural family, they could not resist these "rites" -- The visits of their parents and relatives -- and could not be omitted.

Mask, alcohol and other supplies, I was in the county on January 21 to prepare. At that time, the major pharmacies are still sufficient, I bought dozens of full. Give it away to your parents, and you can imagine how perfunctory they are and how much they think you're making a fuss.

As for wearing a mask strictly, it is no less than Scheherazade.

In 2018, on a business trip to Inner Mongolia, I saw a fashionable wool cloak and bought it for my mother. For two years, my mother didn't wear it once. She asked her why. She said, "if I go to Beijing to see you wear it again, I'll laugh at you if I wear it again in the village! " It is conceivable that in the early days of the epidemic, if a rural woman or an old man who has been a farmer all her life, suddenly in the village wearing a mask and people playing cards, chatting, wearing a mask to worship on the ancestral temple, that is "make mischief" AH!

My parents, who are afraid of others'pointing, love to make mischief in the city and shake my hair at the music festival, dare not stand out too much in the countryside.

On January 23rd and 24th, I went through the village lane to see my grandmother. I was wearing a mask. But when I saw grandma, I had to take it off. In order not to let grandma angry, behind my "burn bag. ". Because of the village elders, two days before the festival, Grandma family to and fro, I still can only take off the mask, one by one shouting "uncle, uncle" , close chat, tea.

The toughest test came on the evening of January 23, when my grandmother left me to have dinner with my cousin, who had returned from a business trip to Xiangfan. A thousand thoughts turn in my stomach. Eat or don't eat? You want to get to the point? Finally, I did not say anything, helped grandma to cook a dinner, as usual swallowed.

On the way home, I asked myself, am I not alert enough? Don't you realize how serious this is? Aren't you afraid of dying? Of course they are. But before the death, fluke and the face, occupied the upper hand.

Shandong people attach importance to face, also attach importance to giving face, etiquette will often become virtual ceremony. To ensure their own safety, or to offend grandma and cousin's choice, I chose: Life, to be a "good man" , relatives in the eyes of not so inhuman people.

Three

Of course, for Shandong people, more important than face is authority.

Shangdong people attach importance to the "top" , care about public office. For example, on holidays, if the male younger generation is not happy to drink push and shove, often will cause the elder unhappy. Poor health and poor drinking are not the best excuses. But if you say, "If you get caught drunk driving during the holidays, you will be immediately fired from your job, " and all of a sudden you are forgiven. Even, will remind you, "must obey the unit discipline" .

It's the same with COVID-19. On the night of January 25th, my sister called to ask if it would be possible to go home the next day without my two children. Dad suddenly became angry, out of a pile of strange argument, saying that "the countryside is the safest, how can the virus find us this corner? Others are running to the countryside to hide, you are good, hide in the city. "

This irritation, or from the "face. ". On the second day of the Lunar New Year, the uncle and the girl of the neighbor family come to the door one after another?

I had the brainwave, from the Internet search for the State Council General Office, "for the community to solicit relevant local and departmental responsibility in the prevention and control of the epidemic in place, prevention and control of inadequate clues, " the red-headed document. "Now the state attaches great importance to it, " he said. "Once a public official fails to observe discipline and makes random visits, he will be seriously investigated and punished after being reported. The consequences will be very serious. "

Dad's fire broke in half, and the fight died down.

Until January 26, my county's epidemic prevention and control work, began to formally implement each village. This is clearly a bit of a drag.

On January 22, the Party secretary of our county conducted a survey on the prevention and control of new types of pneumonia in county hospitals and long-distance bus stations. On January 24, our County held a New Year Symposium for Outstanding Young Talents and a tea party to welcome the New Year in 2020, on January 27, the third day of the Lunar New Year, the website of the county's Government of the People's Republic of China published policy interpretations on Emergency Response To Public Health Emergencies and the popular knowledge of pneumonia in COVID-19, a meeting was held on the prevention and control of the COVID-19 infection in the whole county, and issued the "Shandong COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic management leading group (headquarters) on the strict prohibition of the market live poultry trade and slaughter behavior of the emergency notice. ".

At this time, as of 12:00 on January 27, Shandong Province had reported a cumulative total of 75 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, with a cumulative total of 1,544 close contacts traced.

As such, the government's actions are more efficient and effective.

On January 26, my township held a meeting on the prevention and control of COVID-19 pneumonia. The whole town printed and distributed more than 10,000 copies of the prevention and control of COVID-19 infection, all 44 villages began to trumpet their knowledge of Science.

This Day, did not go home to see their parents sister not only did not become the "joke" around, but by luck "dodged a bullet. This Day, my relatives and friends in the group began to spread all the village entrance ban, set up a special post to prevent villagers visit new year's photos and video.
