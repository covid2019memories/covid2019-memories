##If the flu vaccination rate reaches 40% , will the fever clinic be crowded?

Micro signal

What happened before the Earth was destroyed?

In a study by Louis Kim and his team at the University of Washington, quantitative models showed that when media coverage increased tenfold, the number of infectious disease infections decreased by 33.5 percent. In the face of the epidemic, citizens in addition to cooperate and moved, but also to understand what? We are a group of journalists (formerly) , working on a story on an ad hoc basis, trying to provide some fresh perspective on the COVID-19 epidemic at the moment

Local medical resources in Wuhan have been in short supply since the outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia. People crowded into a few hospitals, demanding medical attention and examinations. According to Caixin Media, Hankou Hospital in Wuhan, one of the designated hospitals for COVID-19 patients, has a wait of seven to eight hours from registration to treatment. [1]

The phenomenon has triggered reflection on many levels. Health and disease experts call for a more elaborate triage system, with community hospitals able to initially screen patients for the common cold and Flu, as well as sending patients to targeted hospitals for possible COVID-19. The reporting mechanism has also been called into question, and it is believed that if the Wuhan government had given sufficient early warning of the outbreak, it could have prevented the spread of the disease, the panic of the population and the subsequent concentration of medical attention. [2]

Among the many factors contributing to this phenomenon is the mixing of flu patients with COVID-19. "The high incidence of influenza and high incidence of COVID-19 infection coexist, making it difficult for hospitals to admit patients, " Peng Houpeng, vice-director of Wuhan's Health and Health Commission, said on Jan. 21. In the subsequent notification of the epidemic in Hubei Province also noted that on January 26, Hubei Province fever clinic a total of 31,934 patients, 3759 people stay. 10,261 in Wuhan, 745 to watch. The data also suggest that a large number of fever clinic patients are not infected with COVID-19, or just ordinary flu.

Influenza is an infectious disease that can be prevented in advance. In February each year, the World Health Organization publishes the strains of the virus that are likely to be circulating during the next influenza season, and Vaccine Manufacturers and National Disease Control and Prevention authorities can follow this recommendation to produce the corresponding vaccine and arrange mass vaccination, to prevent a pandemic at the end of the year. If preparedness had been better prepared for the flu, the number of flu cases would have fallen, and the medical authorities might have been able to spot suspicious COVID-19 earlier, it could also help reduce the current concentration of flu patients and those with COVID-19.

"If we can get rid of the burden of a possible flu infection [ by vaccination ] , we can also get rid of the burden on the public health system. "Jeremy Farad, director of Research Charity Wellcome Trust, told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland [5] .

However, on the issue of influenza prevention and control, the efforts made by the relevant authorities in China are not sufficient.

A shortage of flu vaccine is a problem China faces every year. During the 2018-2019 flu season, China faces its biggest flu vaccine shortfall in nearly years. As of October 21,2018, only 10.91 million influenza vaccines had been approved, down from about 20 million in the same period last year, according to the China Academy of Food and Drug Administration.

The decrease in the number of vaccine lots issued during the year was due to a reduction in production. The French pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur said it had been tracking the quality of flu vaccines and found that they offered less protection against the virus. That may have been the main reason for the decline in the company's flu vaccine production that year.

In addition, an outbreak of fake vaccines in mid-2018 also involved Changchun, a manufacturer of flu vaccines. Although the products in question are mainly rabies and dpt vaccines, the company also declared bankruptcy in November 2019, losing its ability to produce influenza vaccines.

The shortage of influenza vaccines during the 2019-2020 season has not decreased and has become more complex. In the first 11 months of 2019, the China Academy of Food and Drug Administration approved nearly 29 million doses of split influenza vaccine, seemingly returning to the average supply level of previous years.

Statistics from the National Immunization Planning Information Management System (nips) were cited as saying that as of December 31,2019, Guangdong Province had received about 2 million doses of influenza vaccine in the 2019-2020 influenza season, approximately 52.63% of estimated total demand.

Unfortunately, the National Health Commission's judgment on China's overall supply of influenza vaccines is that some people believe that the earlier the better, "bunching" to vaccination points requires early vaccination. On October 30,2019, He Qinghua, deputy director of the Disease Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, said, "However, the vaccine is available in batches and is being distributed in an orderly manner from north to south in accordance with the flu epidemic pattern, resulting in a tight supply at some vaccination points. The situation is gradually easing through increased publicity and better registration of appointments. " [10]

That assessment may be based on the fact that overall vaccination rates are low. Feng Zijian, deputy director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, has said that China's vaccination rate is not very high, at around 2 percent [11] . He estimates there are 26m flu vaccines on the market each year, but only about 20m more people are vaccinated. That is well below the 60 percent of American children and the 40 percent of American adults who receive the flu vaccine.

Vaccination rates are low, leading vaccine manufacturers to be reluctant to produce too much flu vaccine and the health sector to increase access to and investment in vaccines. This, in turn, has led to a lack of attention to flu vaccines, which has led to a vicious cycle of flu prevention in China.

Changing the low rate of influenza vaccination will require a variety of measures, from ensuring the availability of influenza vaccines, to adequate vaccination support from health systems, to a greater understanding of influenza as a disease.

Flu and the common cold symptoms similar, will have headaches, nasal congestion, muscle aches, fever and other symptoms, so Chinese people have long confused the flu and the common cold. However, the common cold and influenza are caused by different viruses, and the symptoms of the latter are more severe than the former, and may cause strong complications, so it is a disease with a higher mortality rate. Between 12,000 and 61,000 Americans have died of flu each year since 2010.

China has also had several flu outbreaks in its history. According to a paper from the division of Infectious Disease Control and Prevention at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China has experienced at least five influenza outbreaks since the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak [12] Foshan
Spanish flu, 1918. The H1N1 influenza virus killed between 4 million and 9.5 million people in China;

1957 Asian flu. The incidence of H2N2 influenza virus in February-march of that year was 30%-50% ;

1968 Hong Kong flu. The H3N2 influenza virus causes between 400,000 and 600,000 cases in Hong Kong;

1977 Russian flu. H1N1 virus subtype, "relatively small impact" ;

Influenza a (H1N1)2009. The PH1N1 flu virus has an infection rate of 7,707 per 100,000 people, with an excess of 30,000 deaths.

During the period from 11 May 2009 to 10 August 2010, a total of 128033 cases of influenza a (H1N1) were confirmed in mainland China in 2009, resulting in 805 deaths and a case fatality rate of 0.6% . [13]

By comparison, the COVID-19 mortality rate on the mainland, excluding Hubei Province, was 0.3% . (case fatality rate 3.68% in Hubei and 2.2% in the mainland)[14]

Even so, flu has long been a low priority in China.

In addition to the relevant departments lack of publicity, but also with China's special statistical caliber. In China, deaths from cardiovascular disease caused by influenza are not counted as deaths from influenza, but deaths from cardiovascular disease.

As a result, the mortality rate for influenza in China is significantly lower. The 2018 Official infectious, released by the Health Commission in 2019, showed that there were 768,000 cases of natural infection in the influenza, but only 144 deaths [15] .

According to a paper published in The Lancet Public Health Journal by the Fudan University's public health, a team of experts from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Chinese Research Institute for the Prevention and control of viruses, more than 88,000 people die each year in China from flu, and more than 80 percent of them are over the age of 60.

Adjusting China's statistics on flu mortality to reflect the true dangers of flu may help raise awareness among the Chinese public about flu prevention and increase vaccination rates. Similar to the Peking University People's Hospital aspiration and critical care director Gao Zhancheng in the National Health Commission held a press conference, "under normal circumstances, the case fatality rate of influenza less than 1% , " the publicity may not help improve China's influenza epidemic situation.

At the medical level, there are many problems to be solved to change the low vaccination rate of influenza vaccine. First, there has been a long-standing tendency in China to emphasize medical treatment over prevention. [17] since 1980s, Chinese medical funds have been heavily used to purchase new equipment, notes a 2003 paper by Wang Shaoguang, a professor emeritus at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, "Funding for disease prevention and testing is always tight, " a group of Chinese health experts said in 2012, china's medical system "and the rural and grass-roots medical institutions are relatively slow development, many areas have appeared in the phenomenon of emphasis on medical care rather than prevention. ".

Light Prevention, nature will despise the role of the vaccine. In February 2019, the World Health Organization Group chose Beijing to publish the 2019-2020 flu and flu strain types, which did not have the effect of encouraging China to increase the scale of influenza vaccination, and CCTV reports continue to mention that "the treatment of influenza, scientific drug use is the key, " and pointed out that antiviral treatment can reduce complications, reduce mortality, shorten hospital stay [19] .

In addition, there are financial implications of mass vaccination against influenza. China's current immunization programme distinguishes between Class I and Class II vaccines. The former is funded by the state and compulsory vaccination. But the influenza vaccine belongs to the latter, is the independent choice, the self-financed vaccination vaccine variety.

Despite the announcement in 2018 by the influenza on further strengthening the prevention and control of influenza, which called for a reduction in the cost of influenza vaccination, cities such as Beijing also provide free influenza vaccination for people over 65 years of age, but the overall investment is still insufficient, coverage is not enough, it is difficult to form a sufficient protective barrier. Takatomi, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, urged: "Beijing should vaccinate its resident population for the flu to work. " [20]

In recent years, the supply of influenza vaccine in China has remained stable and the vaccination rate has not increased significantly, but the incidence of influenza has been rising.

In 2015, there were 195,000 confirmed cases of influenza, according to the Department of Infectious Diseases. In 2018, there were 768,000. The 2019 flu season is not yet over [23] , but the numbers may also hit a new high. From 30 September to 15 December 2019, a total of 979 outbreaks of influenza-like illness were reported in the southern provinces, up from 185 in the same period in 2018, and a total of 296 outbreaks of influenza-like illness were reported in the northern provinces, up from 37 in the same period in 2018.

In fact, the rising number of flu cases is just a microcosm of the current epidemic in China. In 2015, there were 6.4 million confirmed cases of various infectious diseases in China. By 2018, the number had risen sharply to 8.42 million. The death toll also rose from 18,000 to 22,000. There has been a significant increase in both morbidity and mortality. One of the most growth of diseases including influenza, hand, foot and mouth disease, AIDS and other cases.

There are many complex social contexts that have contributed to this change. First of all, with the development of the economy, the population flow has been accelerating and the scale of the flow has been expanding. In 2003, for example, 1.89 billion trips were made during the Spring Festival travel season, compared with 2.98 billion in 2019. In the more frequent human contact, all kinds of infectious diseases have been more infectious opportunities. This new type of coronary pneumonia epidemic because of the continuous geographical migration and caused a large-scale spread.

Secondly, many new infectious diseases, such as AIDS, spread in a more private way, involving people's private space, making prevention more difficult. China has traditionally tended to condemn infectious agents in a moralistic way. For example, the Chinese government has called for a "patriotic sanitation campaign" to clean up dead spots such as rats and sewage, and people are now being accused of being irresponsible in leaving the affected areas, these are all manifestations of the moralization of infectious diseases. However, many studies have pointed out that moralizing infectious diseases only leads people to hide more in socially invisible places and thus fail to receive adequate medical care.

Third, a sound health and epidemic prevention system needs to have a strong ability to penetrate into the social fabric to carry out defense and publicity. After the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China, powerful social machines rolled into the streets of cities and into the countryside. Balanced financial input enables people to enjoy social public services, but also assume certain epidemic prevention responsibilities. However, since the reform and opening up, many public services have been shut down due to lack of financial support, especially in rural areas. The current Chinese society has the ability to monitor the individual, but has no ability to mobilize and support the individual, so the health and epidemic prevention system is facing great difficulties. Both the Health Commission and the Hubei Government have acknowledged that the countryside is the weakest link in the epidemic, with low awareness of prevention and inadequate medical resources.

These changes are, in fact, a pressing problem for China's health and epidemic prevention system. Without targeted solutions, not only will many infectious diseases spread further, but the entire health care system will be put under more pressure. The COVID-19 outbreak is a case in point, with a huge flow of people from both the COVID-19 and flu patients, leaving health care workers on the run and medical supplies in short supply.

The impact of each epidemic on society as a whole is not isolated. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention is required to establish a comprehensive infectious disease prevention and control system, not only because this system can help control newly discovered infectious diseases, but also because it can optimize the overall allocation of medical resources, to better cope with the emergence of a malignant condition such as COVID-19.

We are a group of journalists (formerly) , working on a story on an ad hoc basis, trying to provide some fresh perspective on the COVID-19 epidemic at the moment

Local medical resources in Wuhan have been in short supply since the outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia. People crowded into a few hospitals, demanding medical attention and examinations. According to Caixin Media, Hankou Hospital in Wuhan, one of the designated hospitals for COVID-19 patients, has a wait of seven to eight hours from registration to treatment. [1]

The phenomenon has triggered reflection on many levels. Health and disease experts call for a more elaborate triage system, with community hospitals able to initially screen patients for the common cold and Flu, as well as sending patients to targeted hospitals for possible COVID-19. The reporting mechanism has also been called into question, and it is believed that if the Wuhan government had given sufficient early warning of the outbreak, it could have prevented the spread of the disease, the panic of the population and the subsequent concentration of medical attention. [2]

Among the many factors contributing to this phenomenon is the mixing of flu patients with COVID-19. "The high incidence of influenza and high incidence of COVID-19 infection coexist, making it difficult for hospitals to admit patients, " Peng Houpeng, vice-director of Wuhan's Health and Health Commission, said on Jan. 21. In the subsequent notification of the epidemic in Hubei Province also noted that on January 26, Hubei Province fever clinic a total of 31,934 patients, 3759 people stay. 10,261 in Wuhan, 745 to watch. The data also suggest that a large number of fever clinic patients are not infected with COVID-19, or just ordinary flu.

Influenza is an infectious disease that can be prevented in advance. In February each year, the World Health Organization publishes the strains of the virus that are likely to be circulating during the next influenza season, and Vaccine Manufacturers and National Disease Control and Prevention authorities can follow this recommendation to produce the corresponding vaccine and arrange mass vaccination, to prevent a pandemic at the end of the year. If preparedness had been better prepared for the flu, the number of flu cases would have fallen, and the medical authorities might have been able to spot suspicious COVID-19 earlier, it could also help reduce the current concentration of flu patients and those with COVID-19.

"If we can get rid of the burden of a possible flu infection [ by vaccination ] , we can also get rid of the burden on the public health system. "Jeremy Farad, director of Research Charity Wellcome Trust, told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland [5] .

However, on the issue of influenza prevention and control, the efforts made by the relevant authorities in China are not sufficient.

A shortage of flu vaccine is a problem China faces every year. During the 2018-2019 flu season, China faces its biggest flu vaccine shortfall in nearly years. As of October 21,2018, only 10.91 million influenza vaccines had been approved, down from about 20 million in the same period last year, according to the China Academy of Food and Drug Administration.

The decrease in the number of vaccine lots issued during the year was due to a reduction in production. The French pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur said it had been tracking the quality of flu vaccines and found that they offered less protection against the virus. That may have been the main reason for the decline in the company's flu vaccine production that year.

In addition, an outbreak of fake vaccines in mid-2018 also involved Changchun, a manufacturer of flu vaccines. Although the products in question are mainly rabies and dpt vaccines, the company also declared bankruptcy in November 2019, losing its ability to produce influenza vaccines.

The shortage of influenza vaccines during the 2019-2020 season has not decreased and has become more complex. In the first 11 months of 2019, the China Academy of Food and Drug Administration approved nearly 29 million doses of split influenza vaccine, seemingly returning to the average supply level of previous years.

Statistics from the National Immunization Planning Information Management System (nips) were cited as saying that as of December 31,2019, Guangdong Province had received about 2 million doses of influenza vaccine in the 2019-2020 influenza season, approximately 52.63% of estimated total demand.

Unfortunately, the National Health Commission's judgment on China's overall supply of influenza vaccines is that some people believe that the earlier the better, "bunching" to vaccination points requires early vaccination. On October 30,2019, He Qinghua, deputy director of the Disease Control Bureau of the National Health Commission, said, "However, the vaccine is available in batches and is being distributed in an orderly manner from north to south in accordance with the flu epidemic pattern, resulting in a tight supply at some vaccination points. The situation is gradually easing through increased publicity and better registration of appointments. " [10]

That assessment may be based on the fact that overall vaccination rates are low. Feng Zijian, deputy director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, has said that China's vaccination rate is not very high, at around 2 percent [11] . He estimates there are 26m flu vaccines on the market each year, but only about 20m more people are vaccinated. That is well below the 60 percent of American children and the 40 percent of American adults who receive the flu vaccine.

Vaccination rates are low, leading vaccine manufacturers to be reluctant to produce too much flu vaccine and the health sector to increase access to and investment in vaccines. This, in turn, has led to a lack of attention to flu vaccines, which has led to a vicious cycle of flu prevention in China.

Changing the low rate of influenza vaccination will require a variety of measures, from ensuring the availability of influenza vaccines, to adequate vaccination support from health systems, to a greater understanding of influenza as a disease.

Flu and the common cold symptoms similar, will have headaches, nasal congestion, muscle aches, fever and other symptoms, so Chinese people have long confused the flu and the common cold. However, the common cold and influenza are caused by different viruses, and the symptoms of the latter are more severe than the former, and may cause strong complications, so it is a disease with a higher mortality rate. Between 12,000 and 61,000 Americans have died of flu each year since 2010.

China has also had several flu outbreaks in its history. According to a paper from the division of Infectious Disease Control and Prevention at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China has experienced at least five influenza outbreaks since the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak [12] Foshan

Spanish flu, 1918. The H1N1 influenza virus killed between 4 million and 9.5 million people in China;

1957 Asian flu. The incidence of H2N2 influenza virus in February-march of that year was 30%-50% ;

1968 Hong Kong flu. The H3N2 influenza virus causes between 400,000 and 600,000 cases in Hong Kong;

1977 Russian flu. H1N1 virus subtype, "relatively small impact" ;

Influenza a (H1N1)2009. The PH1N1 flu virus has an infection rate of 7,707 per 100,000 people, with an excess of 30,000 deaths.

Spanish flu, 1918. The H1N1 influenza virus killed between 4 million and 9.5 million people in China;

1968 Hong Kong flu. The H3N2 influenza virus causes between 400,000 and 600,000 cases in Hong Kong;

1977 Russian flu. H1N1 virus subtype, "relatively small impact" ;

Influenza a (H1N1)2009. The PH1N1 flu virus has an infection rate of 7,707 per 100,000 people, with an excess of 30,000 deaths.

During the period from 11 May 2009 to 10 August 2010, a total of 128033 cases of influenza a (H1N1) were confirmed in mainland China in 2009, resulting in 805 deaths and a case fatality rate of 0.6% . [13]

By comparison, the COVID-19 mortality rate on the mainland, excluding Hubei Province, was 0.3% . (case fatality rate 3.68% in Hubei and 2.2% in the mainland)[14]

Even so, flu has long been a low priority in China.

In addition to the relevant departments lack of publicity, but also with China's special statistical caliber. In China, deaths from cardiovascular disease caused by influenza are not counted as deaths from influenza, but deaths from cardiovascular disease.

As a result, the mortality rate for influenza in China is significantly lower. The 2018 Official infectious, released by the Health Commission in 2019, showed that there were 768,000 cases of natural infection in the influenza, but only 144 deaths [15] .

According to a paper published in The Lancet Public Health Journal by the Fudan University's public health, a team of experts from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Chinese Research Institute for the Prevention and control of viruses, more than 88,000 people die each year in China from flu, and more than 80 percent of them are over the age of 60.

Adjusting China's statistics on flu mortality to reflect the true dangers of flu may help raise awareness among the Chinese public about flu prevention and increase vaccination rates. Similar to the Peking University People's Hospital aspiration and critical care director Gao Zhancheng in the National Health Commission held a press conference, "under normal circumstances, the case fatality rate of influenza less than 1% , " the publicity may not help improve China's influenza epidemic situation.

At the medical level, there are many problems to be solved to change the low vaccination rate of influenza vaccine. First, there has been a long-standing tendency in China to emphasize medical treatment over prevention. [17] since 1980s, Chinese medical funds have been heavily used to purchase new equipment, notes a 2003 paper by Wang Shaoguang, a professor emeritus at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, "Funding for disease prevention and testing is always tight, " a group of Chinese health experts said in 2012, china's medical system "and the rural and grass-roots medical institutions are relatively slow development, many areas have appeared in the phenomenon of emphasis on medical care rather than prevention. ".

Light Prevention, nature will despise the role of the vaccine. In February 2019, the World Health Organization Group chose Beijing to publish the 2019-2020 flu and flu strain types, which did not have the effect of encouraging China to increase the scale of influenza vaccination, and CCTV reports continue to mention that "the treatment of influenza, scientific drug use is the key, " and pointed out that antiviral treatment can reduce complications, reduce mortality, shorten hospital stay [19] .

In addition, there are financial implications of mass vaccination against influenza. China's current immunization programme distinguishes between Class I and Class II vaccines. The former is funded by the state and compulsory vaccination. But the influenza vaccine belongs to the latter, is the independent choice, the self-financed vaccination vaccine variety.

Despite the announcement in 2018 by the influenza on further strengthening the prevention and control of influenza, which called for a reduction in the cost of influenza vaccination, cities such as Beijing also provide free influenza vaccination for people over 65 years of age, but the overall investment is still insufficient, coverage is not enough, it is difficult to form a sufficient protective barrier. Takatomi, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, urged: "Beijing should vaccinate its resident population for the flu to work. " [20]

In recent years, the supply of influenza vaccine in China has remained stable and the vaccination rate has not increased significantly, but the incidence of influenza has been rising.

In 2015, there were 195,000 confirmed cases of influenza, according to the Department of Infectious Diseases. In 2018, there were 768,000. The 2019 flu season is not yet over [23] , but the numbers may also hit a new high. From 30 September to 15 December 2019, a total of 979 outbreaks of influenza-like illness were reported in the southern provinces, up from 185 in the same period in 2018, and a total of 296 outbreaks of influenza-like illness were reported in the northern provinces, up from 37 in the same period in 2018.

In fact, the rising number of flu cases is just a microcosm of the current epidemic in China. In 2015, there were 6.4 million confirmed cases of various infectious diseases in China. By 2018, the number had risen sharply to 8.42 million. The death toll also rose from 18,000 to 22,000. There has been a significant increase in both morbidity and mortality. One of the most growth of diseases including influenza, hand, foot and mouth disease, AIDS and other cases.

There are many complex social contexts that have contributed to this change. First of all, with the development of the economy, the population flow has been accelerating and the scale of the flow has been expanding. In 2003, for example, 1.89 billion trips were made during the Spring Festival travel season, compared with 2.98 billion in 2019. In the more frequent human contact, all kinds of infectious diseases have been more infectious opportunities. This new type of coronary pneumonia epidemic because of the continuous geographical migration and caused a large-scale spread.

Secondly, many new infectious diseases, such as AIDS, spread in a more private way, involving people's private space, making prevention more difficult. China has traditionally tended to condemn infectious agents in a moralistic way. For example, the Chinese government has called for a "patriotic sanitation campaign" to clean up dead spots such as rats and sewage, and people are now being accused of being irresponsible in leaving the affected areas, these are all manifestations of the moralization of infectious diseases. However, many studies have pointed out that moralizing infectious diseases only leads people to hide more in socially invisible places and thus fail to receive adequate medical care.

Third, a sound health and epidemic prevention system needs to have a strong ability to penetrate into the social fabric to carry out defense and publicity. After the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China, powerful social machines rolled into the streets of cities and into the countryside. Balanced financial input enables people to enjoy social public services, but also assume certain epidemic prevention responsibilities. However, since the reform and opening up, many public services have been shut down due to lack of financial support, especially in rural areas. The current Chinese society has the ability to monitor the individual, but has no ability to mobilize and support the individual, so the health and epidemic prevention system is facing great difficulties. Both the Health Commission and the Hubei Government have acknowledged that the countryside is the weakest link in the epidemic, with low awareness of prevention and inadequate medical resources.

These changes are, in fact, a pressing problem for China's health and epidemic prevention system. Without targeted solutions, not only will many infectious diseases spread further, but the entire health care system will be put under more pressure. The COVID-19 outbreak is a case in point, with a huge flow of people from both the COVID-19 and flu patients, leaving health care workers on the run and medical supplies in short supply.

The impact of each epidemic on society as a whole is not isolated. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention is required to establish a comprehensive infectious disease prevention and control system, not only because this system can help control newly discovered infectious diseases, but also because it can optimize the overall allocation of medical resources, to better cope with the emergence of a malignant condition such as COVID-19.

During the period from 11 May 2009 to 10 August 2010, a total of 128033 cases of influenza a (H1N1) were confirmed in mainland China in 2009, resulting in 805 deaths and a case fatality rate of 0.6% . [13]
